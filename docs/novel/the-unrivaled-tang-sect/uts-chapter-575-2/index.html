 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi wasn’t concerned about her own safety at all, but Huo Yuhao was the one who was provoking her! She didn’t believe that he could take her life no matter how they fought each other. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have returned alive from that mystical demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faint light flickered in the air, and every soul engineer from the Sun Moon Empire pulled long faces. They couldn’t lock onto their enemy. What was happening? This meant that this fellow could enter their camp as and when he wanted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Safety first, commander. We don’t know where that person is.” Ju Zi had just stepped out from her tent when several Class 9 soul engineers surrounded her. Furthermore, they released a linked defensive barrier and contained her within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi smiled faintly and waved her hand. “It’s alright. He doesn’t dare to venture too deeply into our camp. He won’t be able to escape if he comes in. Let’s go and see what he’s doing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words were simply intended for those around her. Ju Zi was very clear about how strong Huo Yuhao’s survival abilities were after finding out about his demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Commander, the Fire Phoenix Legion has been assembled.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi nodded. “The Fire Phoenix Legion shall follow me into the air. Activate the legion’s linked defensive barrier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were still in the sky, but they were concealed with Imitation, and nobody could see where they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Light continued to flicker as a single sphere of light glowed in the sky. A fiery-red sphere slowly rose from the Sun Moon Empire’s camp in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sphere was translucent, and what was happening inside could be faintly observed. The Fire Phoenix Legion’s soul engineers were all wearing fiery-red soul tools, and their equipment was especially glaring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fire Phoenix Legion’s status among the four beast-ranked soul engineer legions was initially second only to the Imperial Dragon Legion. Ever since Ju Zi took over and after she received Xu Tianran’s adamant support, along with her rising reputation as the War God Empress, the Fire Phoenix Legion’s status was growing increasingly comparable to the Imperial Dragon Legion’s status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beams of light flared one after another in the sky. The air was clearly twisting and contorting a little due to the Fire Phoenix Legion’s linked defensive barrier. This was a phenomenon due to high temperatures, as the Fire Phoenix Legion’s soul tools were mainly fire-type weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was hovering inside the sphere. She was wearing a magnificent human-shaped soul tool that was golden-red in color which perfectly protected her body. Brilliant and flowing light coursed around this human-shaped soul tool, and this soul tool was different from the Sun Moon Empire’s other human-shaped soul tools that Huo Yuhao had seen. Even though he was only observing from afar, Huo Yuhao could faintly feel that this human-shaped soul tool’s capabilities were comparable to that of his Icy War God’s Armor. This set was possibly even superior in some respects. For instance, Ju Zi could use this human-shaped soul tool which was conspicuously at the pinnacle of Class 9 soul tools even with her cultivation rank. This meant that her human-shaped soul tool could reduce its demand for using it. This characteristic was something that the Icy War God’s Armor didn’t have.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, it also depended on who was wearing this human-shaped soul tool. Ju Zi was wearing this human-shaped soul tool more for her personal protection than anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao reappeared in midair with a solemn look on his face. Many soul tools beneath him locked onto him once more as he revealed himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the soul engineers responsible for locking onto his position quickly realized to their astonishment that they seemed to be locking onto nothingness. They couldn’t detect any living presence at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was now a veteran, so he wouldn’t put himself in danger. What he was doing was actually very simple: he used Spiritual Interference Domain and created a hologram a hundred meters away from him. The soul engineers could lock onto that as much as they wished, but they still wouldn’t find his precise location. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection covered the entire place. As long as it didn’t touch any spiritual barriers, any soul tool that was about to fire would appear within his detection range, hence he wouldn’t have any problem dodging attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re the Sun Moon Empire’s War God Empress?” Huo Yuhao’s icy-cold voice travelled into the distance. However, his tone seemed to change a little when he was uttering the last few syllables.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no way his tone couldn’t change. There was a small hand pinching his waist and twisting his flesh a hundred and eighty degrees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Keep pretending!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong thought to herself resentfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi stared at Huo Yuhao coldly as she lowered her voice and replied, “Yes, I am the Sun Moon Empire’s Empress. I am also this army’s commander. I didn’t expect you to show yourself. Since you’re here, then don’t resist capture. Seems like Shrek City can’t protect you after all!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their eyes were both very cold. They were so far apart, and there was also a protective barrier around her, so they couldn’t see each other’s eyes clearly. But strange sensations appeared in their hearts in this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t the first time that they were encountering each other on the battlefield. However, this was the first time that they were facing each other with their initial identities as everybody else looked on, and as enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi wasn’t careless because Huo Yuhao was her opponent. On the contrary, she felt a lot more alert and wary because Huo Yuhao was the one who was hovering in the sky opposite her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t matter that she had gained the upper hand during their previous few encounters. She was very clear with her understanding of Huo Yuhao about how terrifying an opponent he could be if he unleashed his potential. Reality also proved this fact, because the damage that Huo Yuhao had singlehandedly dealt to the Sun Moon Empire rivaled that of the entire Heavenly Soul Empire. How many surveillance soul tools had he destroyed, not to mention soul engineers, soul tool fronts, and whatnot?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi stared at Huo Yuhao in the distance, and she was already very certain that Huo Yuhao was the perpetrator who had ambushed the two beast-ranked soul engineer legions.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It has to be him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said plainly, “I’m responsible for my own actions. You’ve asked for me, and so I am here. I have already detached myself from Shrek City at the same time. Right now, I represent only myself. Catch me if you can. Whoever isn’t convinced can come get me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi grunted coldly and retorted, “You seem very confident of yourself. Do you really think that you can fight against my army of a hundred thousand men all by yourself? You only have two choices: submit to us or die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed. “You want me to submit? Dream on. Who are you to ask me to surrender? Because of those soul tools that you have beneath you? If you understand me, then you should know that those soul tools are useless against me. I’m here today to tell you that I will be a plague to your army from today onward. I will follow you wherever you go. Perhaps killing you will not be easy, but I am confident of killing your subordinates. Your linked defensive barriers cannot be activated continuously, and they can’t cover your entire army, can they?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s voice was projected into the distance with his spiritual power, and every one of the Sun Moon Empire’s generals’ expressions changed drastically when he said those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had all seen Huo Yuhao’s prowess before. Even though they didn’t know what rank he was at exactly, he could take a hit from the Beast God and survive. He had to be a Titled Douluo, at the very least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normal Titled Douluo weren't a big deal, because they couldn’t hide from the Sun Moon Empire’s various surveillance soul tools. They would be blown into bits before they could come near the empire’s army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this fellow was different! Even though they didn’t know how he was doing what he did, they knew that could use his abilities to hide from all of their surveillance soul tools. If a formidable individual like him was determined to massacre and assassinate everyone without any care for his identity, and could not be detected, then everyone would be in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, he wouldn’t target the normal soldiers. Instead, generals and soul engineers would undoubtedly become his targets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They would probably be fine for one or two days, but what if this was done over a long period of time? How many people would he kill? Nobody knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, they weren’t completely helpless, but dealing with somebody like that wasn’t an easy task at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire Sun Moon Empire’s atmosphere became a little tense and down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s expression turned dark as she said coldly, “Since when have Shrek Academy’s graduates become so shameless?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled faintly. “This is war, and there is only victory or defeat. The winner becomes king, and the loser becomes an outlaw. You must know this, Empress, don’t you? Yes, we are no match for you on an open battlefield, and Shrek Academy has already expelled me because of you. Now, I am independent, and I have nothing left to lose. I don’t even have a place to eat. Why can’t I have my catharsis? And you, those who have taken away my livelihood, shall be my targets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi rolled her eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since when has he become so shameless?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can give you your livelihood. If you join the Sun Moon Empire, I can decide to forgive everything that you’ve done. Furthermore, I can appoint you as one of the royal family’s Worshipped. We can give you everything you require.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed, and his laughter was extremely exaggerated. “Really? If that’s the case, I can think about it! My demands aren’t that high. I’ve heard that the War God Empress is quite pretty. I already have a wife, so I can’t take you as my wife, but surely you can be my concubine. You can just be my concubine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” Ju Zi appeared furious. The Sun Moon Empire’s army beneath them fell into an uproar. What was that? That was plain humiliation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi had a glorious reputation within the Sun Moon Empire’s military. She was known as a goddess of war, and she was a military genius that the world could only come across once in a blue moon. In this moment, she was being humiliated by her opponent on the battlefield. Furthermore, Xu Tianran only had this one Empress since she became the Sun Moon Empire’s Empress, and he didn’t have any mistresses or concubines. Huo Yuhao’s words were equivalent to humiliating the entire Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>

If not for Ju Zi’s dignity her authority, they would have lashed out a long time ago.</span></p>
