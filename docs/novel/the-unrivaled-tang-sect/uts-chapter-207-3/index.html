 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao fully approved of Huo Yuhao from the bottom of his heart. He was impressed by the spirit that Huo Yuhao had demonstrated in this attack. Whether it was his comprehension of the Sovereign’s Descent, the combination of his soul and spiritual power or his competitive will, he had reached the highest level of power a Soul King could reach. Even the Dragon God Douluo Mu En couldn’t compare to him at his age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao retracted his fist and drifted down. He then did something no one imagined. As he retracted his fist, he made a sideways flip and did a handstand. At the same time, a strong chill was released from his body. Which felt like a tornado was initiated by a snowstorm and windstorm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His index finger was pressed against the ground, and he started to revolve quickly with this finger as the center. An orange-gold layer of light surfaced on his body, and then an extreme chill engulfed him and the Dragon Emperor Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao was stunned as he said, “Ultimate Ice?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Huo Yuhao flipped his left hand, the snow and windstorm that was expanding outwards stopped. Only his palm was gently struck towards Long Xiaoyao’s belly. He was using a capturing technique from the Tang Sect, but he had changed it from a grabbing motion to a slapping motion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao instantly felt an indescribable chill penetrating his palm. There was even another intense and special aura within this chill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things weren’t looking good. Long Xiaoyao hadn’t thought Huo Yuhao was capable of unleashing such a palm strike. At this point, Huo Yuhao exerted a force from his right hand. As he flipped over, a streak of deep blue sword light shot out of his right hand. It was aimed towards the sensitive center between Long Xiaoyao’s legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao held a respectable status, and naturally had to keep to his word. As he sparred with Huo Yuhao, he only used Rank 50 soul power. Otherwise, Huo Yuhao’s Snowless Glacier wouldn’t be able to overcome his defenses no matter how strong it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Clear Sky Sect’s sect master Niu Tian had once mentioned that the only way to remain completely unharmed by the Snowless Glacier was to avoid it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In terms of cultivation, Long Xiaoyao was superior to Tai Tan. However, Tai Tan hadn’t restricted his soul power then, &nbsp;and his arm was still frozen by Huo Yuhao. Due to the current environment they were in, and the sudden use of his domain, this palm was actually weaker than the previous time. However, it was only slightly weaker! Long Xiaoyao lost feeling in his entire right arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t show any mercy to this Dragon Emperor Douluo. He was about to unleash his Ice Explosion soul skill, while the Unparalleled Chill, Empress Sword was also initiated at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he only had three strikes, Huo Yuhao unleashed his fighting strength to its fullest within those three strikes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how strong the Dragon Douluo was, he was still a man. When some parts of his body were attacked, he would subconsciously protect them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Simply put, most would rather lose their arm than their lower body if they had to choose. Long Xiaoyao also had such a feeling subconsciously. However, the explosive force that came from his arm also left him extremely astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Between victory and his safety, he chose the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A layer of pitch-black dragon scales covered Long Xiaoyao’s right arm. Huo Yuhao’s Ice Explosion soul skill was segregated by the dragon scales that appeared. At the same time, an icy fog also gusted forth from the Dragon Emperor Douluo’s right palm. That extreme chill was forced out from his arm using his immense soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even with Long Xiaoyao’s abilities, he still needed to give his all to force out the effects of the Snowless Glacier. Against the Unparalleled Chill, he could only retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A streak of cold swept past, and a deep blue sword light shot into the sky. It created a light projection that resembled an icy screen in the air. By this point, Huo Yuhao had already retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao looked a little dismal. Even if it were anyone else, they wouldn’t feel comfortable as a sharp sword swept past and left a chilly feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t just move. He’d even unleashed his martial soul. He lost this round even more ridiculously than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Evidently, he didn’t understand Huo Yuhao’s abilities enough. Similarly, it was because Huo Yuhao was strong enough that he could make the Dragon Emperor Douluo lose this bet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s face surged with a patch of red. As he fell back, he spat out some fresh blood. His blood carried a gust of chill. After collapsing to the ground, the region up to a diameter of ten meters around him was frozen in a layer of ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three strikes that he unleashed weren’t that simple. He had to unleash his Sovereign’s Descent to its full extent, and force Long Xiaoyao to react using his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following this, he had used the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice. As he revolved, he had unleashed the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice so that it aided his attack. The strength of the domain was greatly enhanced even though he had only unleashed it for an instant. After that, it was forcefully stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just these alone caused a heavy burden on his body. The Snowless Glacier and Unparalleled Chill that had followed impacted Huo Yuhao greatly, even though he had the help of the Snow Empress’ Spirit! After the three strikes were unleashed, his passageways were also hurt due to the impact of the immense soul power that had coursed through them. After spitting out blood, he felt much better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe and Xian Lin’er didn’t clearly see what Huo Yuhao did. It seemed like the Dragon Emperor Douluo moved after he unleashed his palm and a streak of sword light flashed. It was unbelievable. Their first reaction was that the Dragon Douluo was just giving Huo Yuhao a chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Dragon Emperor Douluo spat out a gust of frozen air after that. It was evident that this gust of air had been poured into his body by Huo Yuhao. Did he really let Huo Yuhao win?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao’s expression was very dismal. After losing to a kid, he was in low spirits. He nodded slightly and said, “You’ve won. Ultimate Ice. Heh, you actually have an Ultimate martial soul. No wonder Mu En wanted to accept you as his disciple even though he was dying. It’s a pity. I should’ve discovered you earlier. All of you can go now. I won’t put you in a tough spot anymore on your journey back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, Elder.” At this point, no one dared to mock the Dragon Emperor Douluo. Although he had lost, he had lost under a lot of restrictions. He was also an Ultimate Douluo. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao might not have been able to make him move if he didn’t target a spot that left Long Xiaoyao terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Long Xiaoyao lifted his head and looked into the distance. Six figures appeared on the horizon and quickly arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their leader was the Tao Tie Douluo, Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan landed right in front of Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Peng started to get depressed when he saw so many people arriving. He was lamenting the fact that they wouldn’t be in such an awkward situation if the Dragon Emperor Douluo wasn’t overconfident and they had just brought more reinforcements. They weren’t able to keep Xian Lin’er and Yan Shaozhe here today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan noticed Long Xiaoyao right away. He focused his gaze on him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person is really strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Xuan, long time no see.” Long Xiaoyao had already recovered from his loss and faced Elder Xuan. He looked a little lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are…?” Elder Xuan was also shocked. In his memory, Long Xiaoyao was very unfamiliar. There weren’t many who would refer to him in such a fashion either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am Long Xiaoyao,” Long Xiaoyao smiled as he introduced himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Xiaoyao? Long Xiaoyao!” Elder Xuan reacted. It wasn’t only him. The rest of the people who had followed him from Shrek Academy were also shocked. “You, you’re still alive?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan was probably the only one left in Shrek Academy that knew all about the enmity between Long Xiaoyao and Elder Mu. That had happened more than a hundred years ago. Elder Xuan didn’t expect that he would still see this Dragon Emperor Douluo after a hundred years passed, and Elder Mu had already passed away.</span></p>

Mu En’s gone, but I’m still alive. I’m still alive!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Haha, hahahaha</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">!” His laughter was filled with sorrow. Even as he was encircled by the six top-ranked Titled Douluo, he flew up into the air and left.</span></p>

Elder Xuan shook his head and watched as Long Xiaoyao left. He looked unprecedentedly serious at this point.</span></p>

Even Elder Xuan couldn’t.</span></p>

Let’s return.” He didn’t want to speak too much, and wore a pensive look on his face. Ever since he’d replaced Elder Mu as the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion, his clothes weren’t as dirty anymore, and he wasn’t as shabby-looking either. However, he still had his wine gourd with him.</span></p>

He used his soul power to propel his body into the air.</span></p>

Elder Xuan was a little stunned as he glanced at Yuhao. He was shocked that Huo Yuhao’s cultivation had reached Rank 50.</span></p>

He was touched from the bottom of his heart. To ensure his safe return, Elder Xuan had welcomed him personally, and even brought a few elders from the Sea God’s Pavilion with him. This showed how close they were.</span></p>

You’ve done well. We all know about your contributions to the academy, and we’ll always recognize them.”</span></p>
