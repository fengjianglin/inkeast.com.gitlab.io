<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the flashing Divine Ice Crystal in his hand, Huo Yuhao’s eyes brightened. He was in awe. “The miracles of this world indeed have to be continuously explored! Ice Empress, what should we do now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress laughed, “Isn’t it obvious? Whether it’s a Divine Ice Crystal that has nurtured an ice spirit or not, it’s still very valuable. Quickly, leave with them. The temperature of this place cannot be matched by the temperature of the outside world. I can sense that the icy spring has entered a state of deterioration. In another few hundred to few thousand years, the temperature here wouldn’t be sufficient to maintain this Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern. When that happens, everything here will be slowly damaged and destroyed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged her words and started moving. How could he let go of so much good stuff? As his eyes flashed, a layer of gentle, icy jade-green light was released from his body. It was his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice contained immense Ultimate Ice soul power, and quickly engulfed the entire cavern. Suddenly, the Divine Ice Crystals in the cavern all lit up, and Huo Yuhao started to extract them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without Ultimate Ice soul power, the price to pay for extracting even a small piece of ice crystal would be huge. Even an Ultimate Douluo wouldn’t be able to operate in such a low temperature. Furthermore, he wouldn’t be able to communicate with the ice spirits. However, Huo Yuhao found it much easier to extract these ice crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pieces of Divine Ice Crystals were pulled out of the walls of the cavern. Not only were they preserved, but it also didn’t take much effort for him to extract them. Without the need for the Ice Empress to remind him, he would differentiate the ice crystals with ice spirits from those that didn’t have ice spirits, and stored them separately in his Starlight Sapphire Ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Ice Crystals were very special, as they contained immense ice-type energy. However, they didn’t feel cold on the surface, only slightly colder than ordinary metals to the touch. However, one could guide the Ultimate Ice origin energy inside them just by pouring in one’s soul power. Without Ultimate Ice soul power controlling the origin energy inside, it would have instead been unleashed in an explosive manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why this cavern was so cold was because there would be times when the ice crystals would become unstable internally, and leak their origin energy. This cavern had been filled with Divine Ice Crystals for a long time. The accumulated cold turned this place into a danger zone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the pieces of ice crystal disappeared into Huo Yuhao’s storage-type soul tool, the temperature in the cavern rose noticeably. The surrounding walls also contained layers of crystals. They looked like huge pieces of ice sludge, and were also very sturdy. However, they were far inferior to to the Divine Ice Crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Huo Yuhao placed the last piece of Divine Ice Crystal into his storage-type soul tool. At this moment, he was suddenly jolted by something, and instantly turned around. He only saw a huge current of water surging towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without the magical power of the ice crystals, the spring water finally surged into the cavern, given that the door wasn’t closed either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed. Both the Skydream Iceworm and Ice Empress fused into his body. He swam upwards strongly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-------------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the well...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu were already very anxious from waiting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been an hour since Huo Yuhao had descended into the well. However, they hadn’t heard anything from the well yet. It had been a long time, and Nan Shuishui doubted that she would be able to hang on for so long if she were the one inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, both of them were similar, in that they had absolute confidence in Huo Yuhao’s abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had seen Huo Yuhao fusing with Wang Qiu’er’s abilities before, and witnessed the great improvement in his abilities after he formed his sixth soul ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Nan Shuishui wasn’t completely confident that Huo Yuhao could deal with the extremely low temperature of the ice cavern, she deeply believed that Huo Yuhao wasn’t going to be hurt in any way, given his seven-ringed cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu was slightly worried as she asked, “Mom, why don’t you go down and take a look? It’s been such a long time, but Yuhao still isn’t coming up.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Shuishui smiled slightly and said, “Why? Are you anxious? It seems like my precious daughter really has fallen for someone. No matter how hard you work, you’ll never be his wife. Why don’t you try becoming his concubine?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu was stunned for a moment, then in disbelief as she stared at Nan Shuishui. After this, she asked, “Mom, are you my biological mother? You’re actually asking me to be someone’s concubine?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Shuishui laughed, “It’s precisely because I’m your mother that I’m giving you this suggestion. At times, you can’t think too highly of yourself. As people always say, it’s difficult for guys to chase girls, but it’s easy for girls to chase guys. There are many ways for a girl to earn the liking of a guy. I’m not literally asking you to be his concubine. I’m saying that if you really like him, you should try your best to chase him. I support you. If I could have such a son-in-law, I’ll laugh even in my sleep.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu’s face turned red, and she replied, “No way. Who’s going to chase him? You don’t know that he’s such a mule in terms of relationships. Apart from Wang Dong’er, he can’t have anyone else in his heart. Didn’t you see what happened with Wang Qiu’er? Qiu’er was so outstanding, but she could only be his sacrifice. She couldn’t even be with him. This guy is very stubborn once he likes someone, even a girl who looked like Wang Dong’er can’t catch his eye. What about me? I’m not going to do that to myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Shuishui sighed and replied, “I know it’s difficult. Hah, just do as you please. Matters of the heart can’t be forced. However, I’m experienced in this matter. If you really like him too much, you must take the initiative. It’s only then that you’ll have an opportunity. If you choose to give up, you won’t stand a chance at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu was silent, and revealed a pensive look in her eyes. After a brief moment, she nodded silently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the sound of splashing water could be heard. Shortly after, a figure flew out from the well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The intense chill forced Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu to stagger backward a few steps. Huo Yuhao slowly revealed himself from the icy fog that surrounded him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, are you fine?” Nan Qiuqiu asked in concern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and smiled at the both of them before saying, “I am. I’m very fine. This cavern is indeed a treasure ground. Elder Nan, you were right. There’s indeed a special rare metal contained inside. Take a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Huo Yuhao flipped his wrist, and a piece of Divine Ice Crystal that hadn’t nurtured an ice spirit appeared in his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The color of the Divine Ice Crystal was obvious outside. It was icy-blue, resembling the color of the sky, while the glow that it emanated was deep blue. Under sunlight, even such a small piece of Divine Ice Crystal gave off an ethereal feeling. It was extremely magical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow, it’s beautiful.” Nan Qiuqiu squealed in delight. She wanted to touch it, but she was stopped by Nan Shuishui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Shuishui had entered the cavern on her own before. She didn’t dare to be impulsive with regards to the stuff inside it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Elder Nan, it’s fine. This metal is called a Divine Ice Crystal. It indeed contains immense Ultimate Ice origin energy, but it’s very stable. As long as you don’t pour your soul power into it, things will be fine.” As he spoke, he passed the crystal to Nan Qiuqiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu received the crystal and looked at it under the sun. Suddenly, the surrounding plot of ground under the crystal was covered by a layer of blurry blue light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Shuishui smiled as she looked at Huo Yuhao and said, “Yuhao, is this ice crystal useful to you? Can it be extracted?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and answered, “I can do it. You need to possess Ultimate Ice soul power to extract this Divine Ice Crystal. I’ve already extracted all the crystals from the cavern. This was why I took such a long time. Sorry to have made the both of you wait.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Shuishui smiled, “It’s good as long as it’s useful for you. Quickly, put it away. I hope your abilities will improve much further.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, she took the crystal from Nan Qiuqiu’s hand. After taking a look at it for a moment, she returned it to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After receiving the crystal, Huo Yuhao pondered for a moment before saying, “Elder, this crystal can only be molded and extracted using Ultimate Ice soul power. Don’t worry, I won’t steal what belongs to the Earthdragon Sect. When I turn them into soul tools, I’ll give a share of the soul tools I produce with it to the Earthdragon Sect. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, this Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern belonged to the Earthdragon Sect. Although Nan Shuishui mentioned that she was offering it to him, this gift was simply too precious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Shuishui and seemed to be unbothered, “In fact, I wanted to use this place as Qiuqiu’s dowry. However, I discovered you were the most suitable person to take control of this place after working with the Tang Sect. Since I’ve decided to give you this place, you can choose what you want to do with it. You don’t really have to distinguish between the Earthdragon and Tang Sect either. Don’t call me Elder, either. You’re Qiuqiu’s friend. You can call me ‘Aunty’.”</span></p>
