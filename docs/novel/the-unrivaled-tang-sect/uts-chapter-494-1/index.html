 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was considered half a spiritual-type soul master. However, he had many evil tricks up his sleeves, too. His Demonic Maggot also contained a lethal poison, so his abilities were actually mixed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the Masquerade Douluo was already very stiff in the air. He was just like the maggots that were struck by Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Blast earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This isn’t good!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan was horrified. Although he didn’t know what had happened to the Masquerade Douluo, he knew that the situation wasn’t good from how stiff his body was, and how Elder Song had appeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How is this possible? No matter what, the Masquerade Douluo is a Titled Douluo! Even an Ultimate Douluo can’t kill him instantly!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To become a Titled Douluo, one had to be very strong. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to handle the strength of a soul core. However, why did the Masquerade Douluo seem like he was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Elder Song’s attack also exposed Huo Yuhao, leaving him facing the Heavenly Centipede Nangong Wan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The huge centipede crashed down on him with a terrifying and dominant aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what Nangong Wan only saw a grin on Huo Yuhao’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A projection flashed before Huo Yuhao transformed into the Masquerade Douluo. At this moment, Nangong Wan was already so close that he couldn’t retract his attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a dark-green light flashed, the Masquerade Douluo was instantly torn to pieces. Under the effect of the poison from the Heavenly Centipede True Body, he was instantly dissolved, and turned into dark-green liquid that dripped down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is Masquerade dead?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan was horrified. Although he didn’t know how Huo Yuhao had switched the Masquerade Douluo over, it was clear that the Masquerade Douluo had been dealt a lethal blow, given how he was completely helpless against his attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao nicely appeared where the Masquerade Douluo was earlier. He had used his Spiritual Duplication to duplicate the Xuanwu Displacement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had used the Xuanwu Displacement many times, and had started to really like this soul skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s definitely a life-saving ultimate skill! The only problem is that I need to find Xu Sanshi to duplicate it again every three times I use it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan wasn’t the only one who was astonished by the Masquerade Douluo’s death. Even Elder Song was shocked. She never expected a Titled Douluo to be so weak. In fact, the Masquerade Douluo’s defense collapsed the moment they had clashed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, Elder Song had thought that the Masquerade Douluo was critically hurt by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything happened too quickly. When Nangong Wan completely disintegrated the Masquerade Douluo, Huo Yuhao had already slipped behind Elder Song.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan tensed up before his Heavenly Centipede True Body squirmed. After this, he opened his mouth wide and released a poisonous fog that engulfed Elder Song and Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I can’t fight anymore. The Masquerade Douluo’s death was too weird.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was so weirded out that he started to become afraid. Although he knew that he was stronger than the Masquerade Douluo, he also knew that the difference wasn’t very big. He didn’t want to die here. He had already made up his mind to flee as he released his poisonous fog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His poisonous fog was his origin skill, and very strong. No soul power could sweep it away, it could only be avoided. It could even cover a large area. It was the best skill he could use to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at this moment, the temperature of the air fell significantly. The already chilly night sky turned even colder, and thick snow started to fall from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The poisonous fog that he released contained water, too. Suddenly, the water in the fog froze, thinning out the fog. A blizzard began to rage. Although the fog couldn’t be dissipated by soul power, it was still useless against the falling snow. The extremely low temperature also greatly restricted Nangong Wan’s speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An illusory beam of rose-gold light seemed to turn from fake to real as it landed on Nangong Wan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan groaned, and his spirit shook tremendously. He immediately detached from his Heavenly Centipede True Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A green projection arrived in front of Nangong Wan. All Nangong Wan saw was a mighty Greenshadow Godly Eagle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Birds were the natural nemesis of centipedes. This was even truer for the Greenshadow Godly Eagle. Nangong Wan, who had just sustained an attack from Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock, could only conjure his soul power to forcibly clash with Elder Song.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The absolute difference in their abilities was demonstrated at this moment. Nangong Wan grunted before he was flung away, spitting blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song’s Greenshadow Godly Eagle immediately flew above his head. It was exactly at this moment that a weird white whirlpool appeared above Nangong Wan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt very confused and blurred after he was dealt such a heavy blow. He wanted to use his protective skill, but he couldn’t do it. The Greenshadow Godly Eagle was now above him, and pierced her sharp talons into his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sharp soul power instantly surged into Nangong Wan’s body. He screamed in pain once again. His own soul power had been sealed, and he had lost the ability to resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the start until the end, the fight lasted less than a minute. Of the two evil Titled Douluo, one was killed, and the other was captured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Greenshadow Godly Eagle turned to look at Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao seemed to be very calm right now. He flew towards Elder Song and gave her a thumbs-up. “Let’s go, Elder Song.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eagle opened its mouth, and Elder Song’s voice came out. “You!... It seems like my decision was right to let you command this operation. Let’s go.” As she spoke, she had already fluttered her wings, and turned into a streak of green light heading toward Heavenly Spirit City. Huo Yuhao used his Imitation to hide himself once again before following closely behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song’s compliment wasn’t without justification. Huo Yuhao’s abilities left her very impressed. The fight earlier was a clash between three Titled Douluo, but in fact, Elder Song clearly knew that the entire fight was under Huo Yuhao’s control. He was definitely a deserved control-type soul master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From his Mass Enfeeblement at the start, Huo Yuhao used some kind of method to weaken the Masquerade Douluo’s defense. After that, Elder Song unleashed her full strength at the Masquerade Douluo because Huo Yuhao had asked her to do it through his Spiritual Detection. Otherwise, why would Elder Song abandon Huo Yuhao to attack the Masquerade Douluo just as the Heavenly Centipede was approaching him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song didn’t think of that. Naturally, their enemies didn’t think of that, either. That was how the Masquerade Douluo was killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao controlled the entire proceedings, using his Xuanwu Displacement to escape from danger. Just as the Heavenly Centipede wanted to escape, he used a domain-type skill to neutralize the poisonous fog. At the same time, he used his spiritual-type attack to stall Nangong Wan and knock him out of his Martial Soul True Body. Elder Song came at that point, preventing him from protecting himself, even with all his strength. Huo Yuhao had even ‘offered’ Nangong Wan his Spiritual Confusion before Elder Song attacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song believed that she could win against both Titled Douluo, even if she fought them herself. However, it would have been very difficult to keep them in the fight. It would have already been good enough if she could kill one of them. However, it would have taken time. The Masquerade Douluo controlled, while the Heavenly Centipede attacked. If they complemented each other well, they wouldn’t have been easy to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, those two evil soul masters were completely under Huo Yuhao’s thumb, and were outplayed. Although they might not have been aware of his abilities, one couldn’t discount his power, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Elder Song truly felt was that all her abilities seemed to have been boosted when she fought alongside Huo Yuhao. During the fighting, it was an unprecedentedly great feeling. Right now, she understood why he was such a symbolic figure in the Tang Sect. He was truly strong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As there were two evil soul masters dealing with Elder Song and Huo Yuhao, the Sun Moon Empire didn’t send anyone else to attack. When they realized something was amiss, Elder Song and Huo Yuhao had already vanished. The two evil soul masters were also gone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They silently returned to Heavenly Spirit City. Nangong Wan had already been knocked out by Elder Song, and they brought him back to the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rest hadn’t gone to sleep yet. They were waiting for Huo Yuhao and Elder Song to return.</span></p>

When she saw Huo Yuhao and Elder Song returning with Nangong Wan, she immediately rushed up to receive them.</span></p>

His shoulders were already stained red with blood. Elder Song had crippled the passageways in his arms and sealed his soul power. He was completely disabled now.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song replied, “You’re right if he’s familiar to you. He’s Nangong Wan, the Heavenly Centipede.”</span></p>
