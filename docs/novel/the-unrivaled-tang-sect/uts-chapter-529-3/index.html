 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the reason why the White Tiger Duke had a headache. He couldn’t possibly relinquish their defensive perimeter along the Ming Dou Mountain Range. Otherwise, if the Sun Moon Empire conquered the Ming Dou Mountain Range once more, the Star Luo Empire would be pushed into an even more backward position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But they couldn’t not defend their northern front. Such a long battlefield was extremely unfavorable for the Star Luo Empire. The Dou Ling Empire behind them had it a lot better in comparison. They had the Heavenly Soul Empire in front of them for defense, after all. Furthermore, once the Sun Moon Empire had completely overrun the Heavenly Soul Empire, they would undoubtedly have to face Shrek City. Shrek City’s strength was an important form of invisible protection for the Dou Ling Empire. That was also one of the most important reasons why the Heavenly Sun Douluo decided to relent, because he didn’t want to offend Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao began to contemplate. “Duke, can we come in?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was shocked by his question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tent’s curtains were lifted in the next moment. The soldiers outside didn’t realize at all as two figures materialized right in front of him. There was only one Huo Yuhao in the tent, but now there were two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke glanced at the one on the right, and then the one on the left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He heaved a sigh of admiration. “That is so amazing! Yuhao, did you know what we were all full of admiration for the strength you displayed when you broke out? Seems like you’re all grown up now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said plainly, “Duke, now is not the time to compliment me. You should think about what you should do. I can report back to the academy once you make a decision so that we can do our best to cooperate with your plans.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke forced a laugh and said, “I wouldn’t be so anxious and worried if there was a good solution. You are very aware of the Sun Moon Empire’s fighting strength at the front, and ambushing them with sudden attacks is also very difficult. They are too flexible and mobile, and they can move around very quickly with their soul tools, especially those formidable soul engineer legions of theirs. I want to hear your advice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “The Sun Moon Empire is ultimately facing the continent’s three empires all by themselves. Their military deployment covers a much larger territory after conquering the Heavenly Soul Empire. Our battlefront is long, but in truth, the Sun Moon Empire faces the same situation. The only difference is that their military strength is concentrated along the nation’s borders as much as possible, and they are having a comparatively easier time because they have powerful soul tools. This also means that their inner regions are extremely empty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke said, “Everyone knows that, but it’s no use even if we know that they have this weakness. The Sun Moon Empire have deployed many surveillance soul tools along their borders. We cannot possibly go undiscovered if we mobilize our armies for an attack. They still have many soul tool forts along their borders, and any front can impede us for a period of time sufficient for them to send reinforcements.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao continued, “If we wish to defeat the Sun Moon Empire and achieve victory in this war, then we have to hold back their main forces effectively while gradually weakening them. This is the only way to put them up to their ears in work, and the only way we can execute a war of attrition against them. Just like when you sent large masses of soul masters into the Sun Moon Empire’s territory to conduct guerilla warfare back then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke shook his head. “That move is not effective anymore. The Sun Moon Empire have increased their production of aerial surveillance soul tools over the past two years, and they have too many eyes in the sky. Our men will be going to their deaths if they attempt to infiltrate again, and we have already tried it. It wasn’t effective, and we lost many men. Unless we have extraordinarily talented individuals like you who also possess formidable concealment abilities, nobody can possibly infiltrate the Sun Moon Empire’s territory.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes sparkled when he heard the White Tiger Duke’s words. He suddenly clapped his hands and said excitedly, “I have an idea, I have an idea!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was momentarily stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took a few quick steps forward and came beside the Duke. He could naturally feel the White Tiger Duke’s aura when he came near, and he couldn’t help but think about the scene when he carried him high into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But his emotions rippled for but a moment before he immediately returned to normal. He whispered something beside the White Tiger Duke’s ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke’s pupils contracted as he listened, and he snapped his head around. “Really? Can we really do that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded forcefully and said, “Theoretically, we can. The Sun Moon Empire will mobilize all their forces when they restart the war. If we don’t take drastic measures, we have no chance of defeating their formidable soul engineer legions on the battlefield. We can only threaten them at their very core to have a chance of emerging victorious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was extremely intelligent, and he immediately understood what he had to do when he heard Huo Yuhao’s words. “Alright. Don’t worry, Yuhao, you can leave the front lines to me. We will use our lives to prolong the battle even if we can’t win so that we can keep them on the battlefield. I will immediately communicate with the Heavenly Soul Empire and the Dou Ling Empire. The three empires will use our combined strength to hold back the Sun Moon Empire’s main forces so that we can buy time for you and the academy. But you have to be quick, because I don't know how long we can hold out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, agreed. We’re very tired, and we wish to rest here for the night over here. We will hurry back tomorrow morning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke got to his feet. He became a little excited after listening to Huo Yuhao’s plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He clapped Huo Yuhao’s shoulder heavily and said, “Excellent, Yuhao. If we can execute your plan successfully, I believe the Body Douluo’s spirit in heaven will definitely bless you with good fortune.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao seemed a little disoriented when the White Tiger Duke patted him on the shoulder with his large hand. He didn’t recover completely even after he returned to the tent that he and Tang Wutong were staying in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong, Yuhao?” Tang Wutong asked concernedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong asked, “Is it because of the White Tiger Duke?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded as he forced a laugh and said, “For some reason, I feel less and less hostility towards him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong smiled faintly and said, “That’s a good thing! Just like Ju Zi said, revenge cannot block out love and kinship. You don’t have to think too much. You should pay attention to what’s at hand, and you can think about this again after dealing with the Sun Moon Empire. It’s not too late to contemplate your relationship with him after beating the Sun Moon Empire back. Furthermore, your mother would be very happy that you’re cooperating with the Duke like this if she had been alive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression became a little dejected when she talked about his mother.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Will mother really be happy? I only had one goal when I entered Shrek Academy back then, and that was to take revenge for my mother! But now, I am getting farther and farther away from claiming my revenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soft knocking sounds suddenly came from outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao swept the area with his spiritual power, and knew who was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come in, Luoli.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dai Luoli pushed the door open and stepped in. His eyes glowed when he saw Tang Wutong. Even though this wasn’t his first time seeing her, this was still the first time that the brothers were interacting alone with Tang Wutong around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dai Luoli took a few steps forward and said softly, “Are you alright, brother? I’ve heard that you conflicted with some Titled Douluo?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was astonished when she heard the way that he addressed Huo Yuhao. She glanced at Dai Luoli, and then at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hurriedly explained to her, “Luoli is the only one who knows my true identity. Luoli, this is your sister-in-law, Tang Wutong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Greetings, sister-in-law!” Dai Luoli hurriedly greeted Tang Wutong respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he hadn’t heard much about Huo Yuhao over the past two years, and they hadn’t met, none of that affected his admiration for his older brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dai Luoli had heard much from Dai Yueheng and his father about his older brother’s legendary stories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao represented Shrek Academy’s elite youths, and he had invented Spirits. He was the Spirit Pagoda’s honorary master, he had an Ultimate martial soul, and he led Shrek Academy’s team to achieve glorious results twice in the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Dueling Tournament. He was a legendary figure among the younger generation of soul masters, and possibly even across the entire world of soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, Huo Yuhao had helped the Star Luo Empire’s Western Field Army turn the tide of battle on several occasions. Dai Luoli had witnessed those episodes personally. In his mind, his elder brother was his idol.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dai Luoli had been standing guard when Huo Yuhao returned. Huo Yuhao didn’t hide his presence when he came out from the White Tiger Duke’s tent, and Dai Luoli immediately came to find him after changing guards. He was afraid that his elder brother would be gone once more if he didn’t go find him, and he didn’t know when they would meet again. Two years had passed since the last time they separated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong smiled and nodded in Dai Luoli’s direction. She was happy for Huo Yuhao, happy that he had at least recognized a relative.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you here, Luoli?” Huo Yuhao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dai Luoli said, “Nothing much, except we haven’t seen each other for so long and I have missed you. Oh, brother, can you get me a Spirit some time?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao grinned and said, “You’re still a Soul King. It’s a little too early for a Spirit. I will definitely find a suitable Spirit for you when you reach Rank 70.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was easy for Huo Yuhao to identify Dai Luoli’s cultivation rank with his strength. Dai Luoli had been growing very quickly over the past two years, and he should be around Rank 55 right now. His cultivation speed was considerably impressive for his age, and it was evident that his potential and talent had been completely activated whether or not his martial soul had truly awakened and mutated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao would have recommended him to Shrek Academy to study if matters at the front lines hadn’t been so pressing. Furthermore, the atmosphere at the front was very suitable for him to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dai Luoli’s martial soul became a Blood Tiger after mutating, and it was most suitable for fighting on the battlefield. Dai Luoli would improve quickest through continuous battle and training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dai Luoli was extremely excited when he heard Huo Yuhao’s words. “Don’t worry brother, I will definitely work hard to cultivate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao inquired about his current cultivation situation, and gave him some pointers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dai Luoli could tell that it was getting late, and only then did he take his leave. “I’ll be going then, brother.”</span></p>
