 <p><strong>Book 13: Life Gold</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 114.3: The Body Sect</strong></p>
 <p>It was probably only the Body Sect that was capable of snatching personnel right under the nose of a Shrek Academy teacher. Wang Yan, however, did not say anything, and only listened in on their conversation.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao continued to shake his head. “No, Shrek Academy is my home. The academy has given me family warmth. They have nurtured me. I won’t join the Body Sect. Elders, I’m sorry, but we shall end things here.” As he spoke, he stood up before turning away and walked towards the stairs.</p>
 <p>“Do you think you’re the one calling the shots?” Yu Tao suddenly stood up. As he stretched out his right hand, his thick right arm instantly caught hold of Huo Yuhao’s shoulder. His right arm seemed able to stretch itself freely. It had stretched out almost 2 meters when Yu Tao grabbed Huo Yuhao’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>Lang Ya turned his attention to Wang Yan the moment Yu Tao made a move. He wanted to use his powerful martial soul to suppress Wang Yan and prevent him from doing anything. But he was shocked to realize that Wang Yan remained calm and had no intention of doing anything.</p>
 <p>The instant Yu Tao’s hand landed on Huo Yuhao’s shoulder, Huo Yuhao shrugged his shoulder and slipped out of Yu Tao’s grip.</p>
 <p>“What a slimy kid.” Yu Tao was stunned for a moment as he felt a gust of chill rising the moment he grabbed hold of Huo Yuhao’s shoulder. After that, he could see that a layer of ice that resembled armor was now coating Huo Yuhao’s shoulder. Although it seemed like ice, it was very tough and slippery. Otherwise, Huo Yuhao wouldn’t have slipped out of his grasp.</p>
 <p>“Using your Spiritual Detection on me won’t work.” Lang Ya snorted and straightened his gaze. A wave of formless undulations spread from his huge head.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao only felt that his Spiritual Detection was crushed like glass. As he groaned in pain, he staggered forward. However, his spiritual sea started to ripple with intense undulations as it was invaded by the enemy. His Pearl of Life that belonged to the Life Guardian flashed brightly. Lang Ya’s spiritual power surged into Huo Yuhao’s head and threatened to invade his spiritual sea. But then, a green glow flashed across Huo Yuhao’s forehead. Following that, Lang Ya’s spiritual power was cut to pieces.</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Lang Ya was shocked at this. Although he had held back a little for fear of hurting Huo Yuhao, he was sure that Huo Yuhao wouldn’t be able to resist him. He immediately thought that Huo Yuhao’s body soul must have already been awakened. However, how could his body soul awaken if it couldn’t awaken on its own and if he didn’t have the Body Sect’s special manual?</p>
 <p>Just as he was about to increase the output of his spiritual power, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Yu Tao. A dirty index finger pressed against Yu Tao’s back.</p>
 <p>Yes, it pressed against his back. When that finger rebounded, it gave off an illusory feeling. Yu Tao tried to dodge, but he realized to his horror that he was unable to dodge even though he was being guided by Lang Ya’s spiritual power.</p>
 <p>“Pop—"</p>
 <p>“Aiyo.”</p>
 <p>Yu Tao’s right arm bounced up, and his entire person staggered backward two steps. A depressed finger mark was left on his thick right arm, which caused him to turn pale.</p>
 <p>Although he did not unleash his martial soul, his right arm was his martial soul since he was a member of the Body Sect! He was forced back by a finger from his opponent under such a circumstance. His shock was greater than the pain he felt.</p>
 <p>On the other side, Lang Ya also retracted his spiritual power. He was cautious as he watched the newcomer who had suddenly appeared behind Huo Yuhao and separated him and his brother.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had also turned his body quickly by now. After a momentary daze, he revealed an intense look of surprise. “Elder Xuan, you’re back.”</p>
 <p>That’s right, the person who had just appeared between Huo Yuhao and the two Body Sect members was an elder of Shrek Academy’s Sea God’s Pavilion, Elder Xuan.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan appeared as slovenly as ever. His enormous, oily hands were holding that familiar drumstick, and he carried a look of ridicule amidst the calmness in his eyes. He spoke as he looked at the two men from the Body Sect, “We won’t tolerate your nonsense! It’s so ridiculous how people dare to climb over Shrek’s head. The 2 of you are brilliant! You dare to poach our student.”</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” Lang Ya was obviously the one in charge among the two from the Body Sect. At the same time, his aura became more authoritative. With his head as the center, the surrounding air up to a radius of 1 meter started to distort furiously. What was even more daunting was that he exerted all this increased pressure on Elder Xuan. He was able to do all this without unleashing his martial soul. This revealed his immense control over his own abilities.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan snorted, “Are the two you from the second or third generation of the Body Sect? That old freak from your Body Sect wouldn’t dare to stand so close to me if he were here, yet the two of you dare to?”</p>
 <p>The rare strands of yellow hair on Lang Ya’s head trembled a little. The distorted air around him dispersed, and his aura declined. He was shocked as he asked, “You’re from the Sea God’s Pavilion?”</p>
 <p>“Since the two of you know about the Sea God’s Pavilion, you’d better scram,” Elder Xuan replied indifferently, “On account of that old freak, I won’t fuss over today’s matter. You’re still not up to it yet. I’m scared that old freak will accuse me of bullying the juniors.”</p>
 <p>Yu Tao’s right arm was still in pain, and he groaned furiously, “Don’t think of bluffing us with your words. At least prove it to us.” As he spoke, his right arm extended quickly again, ballooning in size, and eight soul rings suddenly appeared.</p>
 <p>The appalling thing was that his first 4 soul rings were purple thousand year soul rings, and from the fifth soul ring on, they were black. He had 4 purple and 4 black soul rings. Not only did his soul rings carry a tremendous oppressive power, but they even superseded the ratio of soul rings that ordinary soul masters had.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan acted as if he didn’t see it. When Yu Tao extended his palm toward him, no one could see his actions clearly before his hand was stopped. He was in a daze as he stood there, and his eyes were filled with fear.</p>
 <p>A chicken drumstick had been forced into his mouth. The drumstick’s bone was at the tip of his throat, such that his throat would be pierced through if more strength were exerted. Furthermore, this drumstick had broken all of his teeth before it had entered his mouth. At this point, his lips were forced in, and all of his teeth had been crushed by a chicken drumstick.</p>
 <p>Lang Ya couldn’t even help him in time. Elder Xuan was too quick. If Yu Tao were bolder in his actions, he might have been able to strike Elder Xuan. But the drumstick would have killed him too. That’s why he did not dare to move, and only stood there in a daze.</p>
 <p>Lang Ya was not doubtful at all now, “You, you are Taotie from the Sea God’s Pavilion…”</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan darted a look at him, “Scram. Tell that old freak that I can still eat, drink, shit and sleep.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, elder, for your mercy.” This time, Lang Ya became respectful. He slapped his hand behind Yu Tao’s back, and Yu Tao spat out his broken teeth and the drumstick. The two of them turned and left the Grand Imperial Star Hotel in an instant.</p>
 <p>As he watched their leaving figures, Huo Yuhao respectfully said in a hurry, “Thank you, Elder Xuan.”</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan waved his hand and said, “You are a member of Shrek. Whoever dares to harm you is going against Shrek. Return first and take the time to cultivate. Don’t waste a second. I will be watching your finals.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Huo Yuhao was slightly surprised and excited. He turned and walked towards the stairs. At this point, everyone from Shrek had descended from the stairs. Ma Xiaotao led the group and she drifted over quickly.</p>
 <p>“Where are those two fellows? I will roast whoever dares to bully my younger brother.” Ma Xiaotao’s rage and domineering aura were revealed. However, she stopped as she saw Elder Xuan.</p>
 <p>“Elder Xuan.” Ma Xiaotao stuck her tongue out. She naturally knew Elder Xuan’s status in the academy.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan laughed and said, “Alright, all of you can return to rest now. I will handle this matter.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Ma Xiaotao dragged Huo Yuhao away before she turned and left. Her actions made her seem like a hen protecting her chicks. The rest of the team wore weird looks in their eyes as they saw her and couldn’t help but gossip about what had happened between Ma Xiaotao and Huo Yuhao yesterday.</p>
 <p>All the students left, but Wang Yan remained. “Elder Xuan, the Body Sect…”</p>
 <p>“They’re troublesome.” Elder Xuan said in a deep voice. “If we’d known, we wouldn’t have sent this fellow to compete. Not only is that old freak from the Body Sect dominant in terms of his powers, but he is also a dominant person. I don’t think this can be settled so easily. But I don’t think they dare to test us anymore. I will return to Shrek Academy immediately. I should be able to rush back before the final. I hope that he acts slower. He’s also capable of doing anything, and never resorts to logic. Huo Yuhao also possesses a body soul, which will spur him to do anything. Why is he not dead even though he’s older than me by 30 years? Handle the situation over here well. There must not be any casualties, do you understand?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Wang Yan acknowledged respectfully.</p>
 <p>“What? Body Sect?” Ma Xiaotao immediately interrogated Huo Yuhao as she dragged him into the room. Huo Yuhao did not conceal the truth either. Everyone from Shrek was in the room too. After hearing the words ‘Body Sect’, Wang Dong, Xiao Xiao, Jiang Nannan and even He Caitou were only stunned. But the rest were extremely horrified, including Ma Xiaotao.</p>
