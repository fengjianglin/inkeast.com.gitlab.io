 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, lights suddenly shone brightly from that icy-blue light blade. Silver and gold flashed alternately. The temperature in the air dipped. After this, the blade swiped past the tentacle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King screamed in pain. One of his tentacles had been chopped off by Huo Yuhao just like that. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s figures flashed past just like that. As Huo Yuhao picked up speed, it felt as if he was rushing. However, he still managed to escape from the other tentacles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rather than using pure strength to fight the Evileye Tyrant King, it was best to pit his technique against the Evileye Tyrant King. The Tyrant King didn’t know Huo Yuhao had the Morning Dew Dagger. He was immediately at a disadvantage the moment they started fighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at the same time, the Evileye Tyrant King’s wrath was awakened. His pupil darkened. After this, a dark-red wheel of light appeared at the perimeter of his sea of spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Om—” The sky seemed to shake tremendously. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong felt as if there were thousands and thousands of spikes piercing their spiritual seas. After this, the spikes began pulling their spiritual seas out of their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of power is this?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was astonished. It was his first time facing the Evileye Tyrant King. While his overall powers were inferior to Di Tian, he was undoubtedly the strongest when it came to spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it were someone weaker, his spiritual sea would have been stripped from his body. Without a spiritual sea, one would become an idiot. How could he possibly resist then?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong both had spiritual soul cores. When they felt that immense pulling force on their spiritual seas, their spiritual soul cores quickly shook. Their spiritual power resisted the spikes that had entered. However, even so, they stalled for a moment. This gave the Evileye Tyrant King the chance to entangle his tentacles over them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was also at this moment that an icy-blue glow shone from Huo Yuhao’s body. A clear and transparent tuft of grass appeared on his shoulder – it was the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t even need to control it. His Spirit immediately fired an attack on his behalf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Star Anise Omnithrust!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless ice spikes fired from Huo Yuhao’s body. As the tentacles hit the ice spikes, remnants of ice scattered everywhere. However, they were eventually still blocked off, and didn’t reach Huo Yuhao or Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A deep-blue sword light appeared next. The Snow Empress was standing by Huo Yuhao’s side. She used one of her Three Ultimate Techniques, Unparalleled Cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More than ten tentacles were sent flying by this attack. Although the Unparalleled Cold wasn’t as sharp as the Morning Dew Dagger, and couldn’t directly cut them off, it still froze them under the effect of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress appeared beside the Snow Empress. Her eyes were shining with jade-green light. As she turned around, she revealed her Ice Empress True Body. She hooked her tail up, and a jade-green streak of light shot towards the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Huo Yuhao didn’t prepare this soul skill, the Ice Empress could still use it after she gradually restored her origin strength. Right now, it was as if Huo Yuhao had unleashed his martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh!” The Evileye Tyrant King exclaimed once again. He shot out a beam of black light from his pupil. When this beam of light clashed with the streak of green light, countless sparks formed in the air. It was also at this moment that the Ice Empress closed up her pincers tightly. Suddenly, the tentacles that were frozen exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn’t expect her attack to hurt the Evileye Tyrant King. She only wanted to get his attention and stall him from dealing with his frozen tentacles. Once this was done, she used her Ice Explosion Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King’s tentacles were indeed very strong. Even the Ice Explosion Technique couldn’t destroy them. Only some purplish blood splattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Both of you have really infuriated me!” The Evileye Tyrant King roared in fury. All his tentacles straightened instantly. Right now, Huo Yuhao had only just regained his awareness after recovering from the spiritual attack earlier. He was also astonished to see that every tentacle at the front had a similar-looking eye as the Evileye Tyrant King himself. It was just that they were much smaller. Right now, every eye was shining with a strange glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from the one tentacle that Huo Yuhao had chopped off, the remaining eighty tentacles were all flashing with dim light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, be careful!” The Snow Empress shouted. At the same time, she turned around and vanished. She turned into a huge patch of snowflakes and disappeared into her surroundings. She proceeded in the direction of the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was the Snow Empress, ranked third among the Ten Great Savage Beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King roared furiously. His eighty tentacles unleashed eighty pure black rays. When they were fired, it felt as if the sky had changed color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The snowflakes that the Snow Empress transformed into danced in the air. They avoided the rays. In any case, the rays weren’t aimed at her. They were aimed at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could clearly sense the trajectories of the soul rays using his Spiritual Detection, but he had no way of avoiding them. On a spiritual level, he was eventually still inferior to the Evileye Tyrant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong suddenly took a step forward. She came in front of Huo Yuhao and swung her Clear Sky Hammer. This time, the black projection of a giant hammer surfaced behind her. When this hammer appeared, it grew in size along with the wind. Almost instantly, it was more than a hundred meters long. It hammered heavily in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Tang Wutong’s Clear Sky Hammer True Body. Even Huo Yuhao was only seeing this ability for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tremendous booms sounded. The entire sky seemed to crack and collapse. A great suction force caused Huo Yuhao and the Evileye Tyrant King to shake as they were pulled slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black rays that the Evileye Tyrant King had unleashed immediately scattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they only scattered for a moment. At the next instant, they actually disappeared. When Tang Wutong discovered them again, they were already in front of both of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was spatial power. The Evileye Tyrant King had actually combined his spatial and spiritual power very well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong didn’t retreat. She used the hammer to block them. After this, a terrifying intent was unleashed from her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A golden pattern started to spread on her Clear Sky Hammer. After this, the surrounding space turned silver with the Clear Sky Hammer at the center. After this, the void cracked. This time, the eighty black rays were finally dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was spatial power too. However, Tang Wutong’s spatial power was fused with the ultimate strength of her Clear Sky Hammer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dissipated black lights blew apart in the air. However, Tang Wutong was still struck by the shockwave. She shuddered, and her Clear Sky Hammer True Body vanished. A thought was also transmitted to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Spiritual Numbness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong shone brightly with golden light immediately after this. It was a sign that she was using her cultivation to fight the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Evileye Tyrant King suddenly released a violent and wild intent. Following this, his huge pupil turned fresh red. A giant beam of red light shot out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a terrifying beam of light that was around three hundred meters long! The snowflakes that the Snow Empress had transformed into were all engulfed within it. It was also approaching Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Evileye Tyrant King’s strongest attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao only felt his spiritual sea being overwhelmed. It felt as if a catastrophic event was imminent. After probing with a few attacks, the Evileye Tyrant King finally used his strongest attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress re-appeared in front of him. She fused with the Ice Empress. After his, a streak of icy-white and jade-green combined before they shot out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the Evileye Tyrant King’s terrifying attack, this streak from the Pride of the Ice and Snow Empresses was only ten meters long, and was much smaller. However, it protected both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom—” A tremendous boom echoed in the air. A big hole seemed to have been blown open in the sky. A frightening spiritual intent was unleashed, along with the immense aura of Ultimate Ice. Spiritual undulations spread everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Broken holes could be seen everywhere in the sky, which took a long time to close. The entire sky shook from the brutally strong intent on display. This was the result of a clash between extremely powerful parties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice and Snow Empresses were only Spirits after all, and weren’t in their original forms. Otherwise, they might not be afraid of the Evileye Tyrant King if they teamed up. Right now, they could only use Huo Yuhao’s strength. Huo Yuhao’s cultivation was still a little way off from the Snow Empress at her peak.</span></p>
