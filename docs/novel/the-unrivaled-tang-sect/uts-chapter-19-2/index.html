 <p><strong>Book 3: Fusion of Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 19.2: Soul Fusion Skill—Empyreal Net</strong></p>
 <p>When the Power Cannon collided with the black halo of light, a large part of it was immediately crippled. Although its explosive force was enough to send the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron flying when it smashed into the cauldron, Huang Chutian’s attack was finally neutralised. Furthermore, the Lan sisters were currently facing Wang Dong’s all-out attack.</p>
 <p>The Lan sisters had clearly underestimated their opponents. Although Huang Chutian was at a disadvantage when fighting Wang Dong, he hadn’t been defeated. However, they’d forgotten that Wang Dong wasn’t by himself! As Wang Dong flew straight towards them whilst tearing apart their Hairnets, they realised that they didn’t have enough time to use their second soul skills anymore, as there needed to be a certain amount of distance between the two parties for its greatest might to be unleashed.</p>
 <p>The sisters glanced at each other, a determined look appearing in their eyes. The soul rings on the two girl’s bodies simultaneously disappeared, and they suddenly unclasped their hands. Next, they unexpectedly opened their arms and hugged each other.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was stunned for a moment—what were they trying to do?</p>
 <p>The Lan sisters answered his question a moment later. They instantly released an undulation of soulforce that greatly exceeded that of the previous one. The instant that they embraced each other, a blue halo of light was released from their bodies, which encapsulated them and made it impossible to see them clearly. At the same time, their long hair flew into the air and turned a shade of sparkling blue. Their Hairnets were still as thin as before, but the feeling that they gave Wang Dong as they tried to cover him this time was entirely different.</p>
 <p>His Guillotine Wing cut into it again, but it wasn’t cut through instantly like it had been before. Wang Dong felt as if he’d smashed into an extremely flexible and durable net; no matter how much he struggled, the net got smaller and smaller around him. The instant that the large net completely covered him, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing unexpectedly disappeared.</p>
 <p>Could Huo Yuhao have stopped the skill? The answer to that was obviously ‘no’. The reason behind Wang Dong’s current predicament was due to the fact that this soul skill was simply too strong; so much so that its enormous soulforce undulations had allowed it to forcefully block out Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection. No matter how you looked at it, Huo Yuhao was still only a one-ringed soul master after all.</p>
 <p>In what seemed to be an instant, Wang Dong had become a dumpling trapped within the net of hair; the sparkling strands of blue hair had surrounded him completely. However, the ‘omnipresent’ strands of hair didn’t simply stop here. Instead, they rapidly flew towards Xiao Xiao and Huo Yuhao to entrap them as well.</p>
 <p>“A soul fusion skill?” Xiao Xiao let out a surprised cry. She quickly unleashed an all-out attack with the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron. The large cauldron split into three smaller cauldrons in midair, before smashing into the large web.</p>
 <p>This so-called ‘soul fusion skill’ was a combined skill that could be unleashed by two soul masters who had extremely congenial martial souls. Hence, the power of a soul fusion skill far exceeded that of any soul skill of the same rank. It was an existence that was no longer on the same level as other soul skills. On the other hand, a soul fusion skill could only be unleashed by an extremely small number of soul masters; finding two compatible soul masters was as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
 <p>Huang Chutian was naturally the strongest individual on his team, but their team’s true trump card was the soul fusion skill that the Lan sisters could use!</p>
 <p>During their previous matches, they’d made sure to patiently restrain themselves. They went so far as to not use their soul fusion skill, even if it meant losing a match. However, this was the first match of the fifth round; they couldn’t afford to lose anymore. Huo Yuhao’s team was Class 1’s seeded team. Likewise, Huang Chutian and the Lan sisters were Class 7’s seeded team; their duty was to gun for the top three spots.</p>
 <p>Because of this, the Lan sisters had decided to embrace each other and activate the Empyreal Net only after considering it for a brief moment.</p>
 <p>Don’t even mention a two-ringed Soul Grandmaster; even a three-ringed Soul Elder wouldn’t be able to escape from the Empyreal Net if he was all by himself.</p>
 <p>When the Empyreal Net swallowed up the three black cauldrons, Xiao Xiao let out a frail cry, causing three simultaneous rumbling sounds to ring out from within the Empyreal Net.</p>
 <p>The Empyreal Net unexpectedly shook a little bit. This was the skill that had previously blocked Huang Chutian’s soul skill—the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron’s first soul skill: Cauldron Quake.</p>
 <p>Its activation this time around differed from its previous usage. This time, Cauldron Quake was simultaneously used by all three cauldrons, causing its strength to be fully released.</p>
 <p>The secret behind Xiao Xiao’s Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron lay here: when the three cauldrons were fused together, their defensive capabilities were at their greatest. When the three cauldrons were separated, their attacking capabilities and soul skills power were at their greatest.</p>
 <p>However, the Empyreal Net was still a soul fusion skill! Although Xiao Xiao’s all-out Cauldron Quake was extremely strong, it paled in significance to the Empyreal Net. After a slight tremble, the Empyreal Net continued to fly towards Xiao Xiao, appearing before her in an instant.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Huo Yuhao suddenly shouted, “Wang Dong!”</p>
 <p>The Empyreal Net which had already neared Xiao Xiao suddenly stopped, as if it had been intimidated by Huo Yuhao’s voice. A strong bluish-golden light suddenly lit up from within the depths of the Empyreal Net.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s Mental Detection Sharing had been activated the whole time. Although it was currently being blocked by the Empyreal Net, Xiao Xiao still felt the strengthening effect of his Mental Detection Sharing. Suddenly, to her astonishment, the originally wide-range Mental Detection Sharing suddenly narrowed down and pierced straight into the heart of the Emypreal Net in the instant that Huo Yuhao shouted.</p>
 <p>Not only that, but Huo Yuhao’s soulforce undulations seemed to be rapidly rising, along with an incomprehensible force that seemed to be mixed in with it. Afterwards, Xiao Xiao felt as if something had swept over her mind, causing a wave of dizziness to overcome her.</p>
 <p>Following that, the omnipresent Empyreal Net collapsed, like it had been washed away by the tide.</p>
 <p>“Putong——”</p>
 <p>As Wang Dong landed, he took a few deep breaths. Evidently he’d been severely drained. On the other hand, the Lan sisters had been left in an even worse condition; they’d already fainted and were lying on the ground.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s face was now extremely pale; he was so tired that he couldn’t even maintain his Mental Detection Sharing. Although he wasn’t as out of breath as Wang Dong, his chest was unceasingly moving up and down.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan, who was still overlooking the arena, looked on with an inconceivable look in his eyes.</p>
 <p>When the Lan sisters had activated their Empyreal Net, his eyes had already been filled with astonishment. He’d originally thought that Huo Yuhao’s team was destined to lose, but he never expected the dramatic change that had just occurred. Just as the Empyreal Net was about to defeat its opponents and obtain victory for Huang Chutian’s team, Huo Yuhao’s team had unexpectedly managed to flip heaven and earth around in an instant.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan was depressed by the fact that he’d been unable to see how Huo Yuhao’s team had made their move. This was especially true for Huo Yuhao himself; from his pale expression and his previous yell, it was evident that he’d made a move. Furthermore, it was highly likely that breaking the Empyreal Net was something that he’d achieved by going all-out. However, in what way had he made a move? And, how had he broken a soul fusion skill? Wang Yan just couldn’t see how he’d managed to do it.</p>
