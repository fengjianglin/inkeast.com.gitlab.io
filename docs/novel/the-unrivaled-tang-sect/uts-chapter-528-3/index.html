 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, they didn’t think of harming Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. Both of them came from Shrek Academy. If they harmed them, how could they account to the academy? Because of this, they underestimated their opponents, and didn’t give it their all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo returned, but he looked a little pathetic. The Icy Meteor had sent him extremely far away. At that instant, he couldn’t resist, even though he wanted to. He could only muster his soul power to protect himself. When he finally accumulated enough strength to unleash a powerful soul skill, the Icy Meteor blew apart. The explosion didn’t hurt him, but pushed him even further away. Undoubtedly, this was the result of Huo Yuhao’s immense spiritual control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rest of the Titled Douluo didn’t pursue Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, as they had lost track of their auras. Furthermore, they were all in disbelief right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who would have thought that two youngsters who were barely twenty would managed to break free from an encirclement of more than ten Titled Douluo? They even managed to escape before any real fight had begun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was also wide-eyed in shock. When he saw the frustrated Heavenly Sun Douluo, he was a little speechless too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heavenly Sun, should we pursue him?” A Titled Douluo from the Dou Ling Empire asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Heavenly Sun Douluo saw the Golden Road, there was an uncertain expression on his face. After a brief moment, he said in a weird voice, “When we went to the Sun Moon Empire, we only had one target – assassinate Xu Tianran. Eventually, the Body Douluo sacrificed his life to bring everyone back safely. This matter will end here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the Heavenly Sun Douluo’s words, the White Tiger Duke heaved a sigh of relief. Without a doubt, the Heavenly Sun Douluo had compromised. His words meant that he wouldn’t pursue this matter any further. He would take it as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was undoubtedly the wisest choice. At least, they wouldn’t offend Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t because of how much the Heavenly Sun Douluo admired Huo Yuhao. More importantly, it was because of the terrifying powers that he had revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was already so strong, even though he was barely twenty. If he was able to escape from the hands of more than ten Titled Douluo now, what would he be like in ten years’ time? There was no longer any way of seeing through him. Even the Rank 97 Heavenly Sun Douluo felt fearful because of him. Yes, fearful was the right word to use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, they were sure that he was bound to become the person who would truly control Shrek City in the near future. He was definitely going to become an Ultimate Douluo! At least his abilities were unheard of, even for the Body Douluo when he was at Huo Yuhao’s current age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had twin martial souls, of which one was an Ultimate martial soul and the other was a spiritual-type martial soul. His soul skills were immensely strong, and he even had Spirits, something that he had come up with on his own. Undoubtedly, he was a generational figure of the Douluo Continent. No one could see through him anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke walked in front of the Heavenly Sun Douluo. He sighed and said, “It seems like we were really wrong. For someone like Huo Yuhao, we can say that he is a product of destiny. If he disagrees with something, it should be wrong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo’s facial muscles twisted, and he said, “That rascal. He was really merciless! I was almost hurt just now. If I knew he was so strong, I would have gathered all the strength we could and attacked Xu Tianran. We might have succeeded.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Broken Star Douluo laughed bitterly. “If someone had told you that he was that strong, and could even resist you, would you believe it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You wish. I’m going now. Those from the Dou Ling Empire, come with me.” The Heavenly Sun Douluo didn’t want to remain any longer. He took advantage of the night and quickly left with the Titled Douluo from the Dou Ling Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few days later, the news that the three empires from the original Douluo Continent had sent many soul masters to the Sun Moon Empire to assassinate Xu Tianran, along with news of the Body Douluo’s death and Xu Tianran’s critical injuries, quickly spread throughout the entire Douluo Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire’s army also started to act weirdly after that incident. According to the intelligence gathered, many soldiers seemed to have been deployed within the Sun Moon Empire. It felt like something serious was about to break out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were in the Sun Moon Empire right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving the Ming Dou Mountain Range, they took Xu Tianran on one round before they returned to the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There weren’t any Titled Douluo with them this time. The two of them were thus more agile, and managed to sneak their way back within the Sun Moon Empire’s borders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Yunhan was sleeping very sweetly. It was only at dawn on the second day that he woke up in Huo Yuhao’s arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he opened his eyes, he was about to cry. However, when he saw that he was in Huo Yuhao’s embrace, he smiled as he screamed, “Daddy, daddy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao caressed his head and softly said, “Call me uncle. I’m not your father. I’ll make you something nice to eat later. After you finish, I’ll send you home, alright? Go home and find your mom.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mommy, mommy!” Little Yunhan screamed twice, but then his eyes turned red, and he started to cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong snapped, “It’s all your fault. You triggered him by mentioning his father.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, the temptation of food was much greater to a one-year-old kid compared to the temptation of meeting his mother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao made his signature fish soup and fed it to little Yunhan, he stopped crying. He was delighted as he feasted on the fish. Even though he was barely a year old, he was already very big. He ate a lot of fish and even drank the fish soup. He was extremely joyous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao’s inexperience with kids was still exposed. Yunhan had peed all over Huo Yuhao’s body, and only left him with a warm but wet feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They didn’t have any children’s clothing! They could only strip little Yunhan’s pants before using Huo Yuhao’s shirt to wrap him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he flew into the sky again and proceeded in the direction of Radiant City, Huo Yuhao sighed, “Bringing up a child isn’t easy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong laughed and replied, “I wonder who it was that said that he would take care of our kid in the future?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chortled and said, “It’s not easy, but I didn’t say I’m not going to do it. If you are willing to give birth, I’ll take care of every child that you bear.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong turned red. “Wishful thinking. You have to earn my father’s approval first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed, “For someone as outstanding as me, I don’t think I can fail even if he’s extremely picky. When we return this time, let’s invite him over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong gently acknowledged his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them were in a rush. When they came close to Radiant City, they were both stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just two days, the eastern suburb of Radiant City had been completely filled with soldiers. At least a few hundred thousand soldiers were gathered there. From afar, Huo Yuhao felt as if Radiant City was like a monster that was brewing with anger as he sensed it with his immense power of destiny. This monster was ready to bare its fangs at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned serious immediately. It was indeed like he had expected. The Sun Moon Empire had no intention of compromising because of Xu Yunhan’s disappearance. On the contrary, the Sun Moon Empire seemed to have been enraged. Many soldiers were gathered here right now. Without a doubt, they were here to re-ignite the war!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A large-scale war couldn’t be re-ignited at will. Although the Sun Moon Empire had been accumulating their strength for some time, they would still need to deploy a large number of reserves if they wanted to deploy their troops suddenly. They couldn’t do it immediately, but it wouldn’t take them long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong turned grim too. “It seems like the Sun Moon Empire is going to attack more ferociously than before. I’m afraid it’s going to be more difficult to deal with them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Even if we didn’t snatch the Crown Prince, I believe Xu Tianran would have attacked a few days after the ceremony. But now, they have even more reason to do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong looked at Xu Yunhan. “What should we do then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “No matter what, we need to bring this fellow back first. I’ve said before that war has nothing to do with a kid. This is a confrontation between adults. I’ll protect my empire and do my best to resist its enemies. However, I won’t do anything lowly.
