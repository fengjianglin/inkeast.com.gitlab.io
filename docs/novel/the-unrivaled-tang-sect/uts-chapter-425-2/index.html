Initially, they only gently touched each other before they bounced away, like two rubber balls. Just when Dai Luoli heaved a sigh of relief and thought this had all been a meaningless game, he suddenly realized that there was a trace of blood connecting the two drops. Before he could react, the two drops fused together rapidly, turning into a bigger drop of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!” Dai Luoli was shocked, and snatched the bowl away from Huo Yuhao. He brought the bowl up to his eyes, and was in a daze when he saw that there was only one big drop of blood left in the bowl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao sat on the bed next him and revealed a bitter smile. “Yes, I’m just like you. We are both sons of that guy, it’s just that our mothers are different. I was born one year earlier than you, so I’m your biological elder brother. It’s a pity that I’m similar to you in another aspect, as I’m also a bastard child. Furthermore, my mother’s status is even lower than your mother’s. She was only the maid of that person before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When I was small, I also lived in the Duke’s Mansion. Your mother took great care of my mother. If not for her initial support, I might not even have survived. My mother was always very grateful to her. Even just before she died, she still didn’t forget how good your mother was to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My mother passed away, and I was forced to live with the servants in the Duke’s Mansion. I lived a treacherous life. It took her great pains to raise me. After that, she contracted a serious disease, and never got up after she was kicked by Dai Huabin once. That year, I was only ten. I can’t even remember things clearly anymore, because that memory was one of the darkest in my life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After that, I left the Duke’s Mansion and roamed around on my own. Fortunately, my martial soul is mutated like yours. However, I didn’t inherit that person’s White Tiger, but got my martial soul from my mother, instead. My martial soul is my eyes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao looked at the shocked Dai Luoli and revealed the dim golden light of his Spirit Eyes. Dai Luoli could clearly see the pupils in Huo Yuhao’s eyes slowly split into two pupils. One pupil was purplish-gold, while the other was rose-gold. It was extremely strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Polycoria. This was the greatest peculiarity of the White Tiger’s lineage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hate almost everyone from the Duke’s Mansion, not including you and your mother. Your mother was the benefactor of me and my mother. This was why I decided to help you after I discovered your identity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli took in a few deep breaths again, and his chest shook tremendously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You, are you really my elder brother?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pointed at the bowl he was holding. “That proves it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you join the military because of me? When did you find me?” Dai Luoli asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “No, I didn’t join the military because of you. I’m also from the Star Luo Empire. I won’t admit that I come from the Duke’s Mansion, but I belong to the Star Luo Empire. Since the empire is in trouble, I have a responsibility as a citizen. I became a soldier to protect my nation. I chose to start as a recruit because I want to prove to him that I’m not inferior to him. When I manage to achieve a high ranking in the military through my own merits, I’ll personally get everything that the White Tiger Duke owes me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli placed the bowl he was holding to one side and walked a few steps closer to Huo Yuhao. The two of them didn’t look exactly alike. Huo Yuhao’s facial lines were gentler, while Dai Luoli’s looked colder. He resembled the White Tiger Duke more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You, you want to deal with dad?” Dai Luoli’s voice sounded very uncertain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A lost look flashed across Huo Yuhao’s eyes, but he soon regained his determination. “When this crisis is over, and I’m strong enough, I will do so. I’ll return to the Duke’s Mansion and demand justice for my mother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli sat down beside Huo Yuhao and softly said, “Elder brother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s body trembled a little after Dai Luoli called him that. Even with his strong willpower, he wasn’t able to control his emotions at this moment. His eyes suddenly turned red, and his tears flowed uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stretched his hand out and grabbed Dai Luoli’s shoulder. He bit his lips tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How much time had passed since he had left the Duke’s Mansion? All these years, he had no relatives, and treated the Tang Sect and Shrek as his family. However, everyone shared a blood relationship with someone else. Right now, the person sitting beside him and calling him ‘elder brother’ shared a blood relationship with him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli’s eyes turned red when he saw the tears on Huo Yuhao’s face. Huo Yuhao’s earlier description had sounded very plain. However, he could tell that Huo Yuhao had suffered a lot.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ten-year-old child roamed the world on his own</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How did he manage to survive all these years? Soul masters have to hunt and kill soul beasts. He handled all those dangers by himself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder brother, how did you manage to survive all these years?” Dai Luoli asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head gently and said, “There are some things I can’t tell you yet. You’ll find out later. I told you about our relationship because I want you to trust me completely. From now on, you need to follow me. I’ll make you stronger as quickly as possible. At the very least, you mustn’t be worse than Dai Yueheng and Dai Huabin!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Dai Luoli nodded. He didn’t have a close relationship with Dai Yueheng and Dai Huabin. Both of them were legitimate children, and went to Shrek Academy when they were young. They didn’t really interact with him. On the contrary, it was Huo Yuhao’s tears that left him moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wiped his tears away and put his mask back on. He said, “I’m Tang Dong here. Don’t tell anyone about my identity or background, especially that person. If you reveal anything, you won’t be able to see me again. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli was stunned and said, “Elder brother, you and father…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao waved his hands and said, “I don’t want to make him sound bad in front of you. That’s why you shouldn’t mention him in front of me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli laughed bitterly. “Alright, don’t worry, I’ll keep this a secret for you. Elder brother, are we still going out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Yes. I’ve been feeling a little uncomfortable these past few days. Something must be about to happen. It has been almost ten days since the Sun Moon Empire breached our border, but they haven’t done anything since. This is completely abnormal. Almost all our reinforcements have arrived. Are they trying to fight us in our peak state? Why didn’t they exploit the opportunity when we were weaker? This is too weird. It doesn’t fit military strategy. Follow me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Huo Yuhao left with Dai Luoli and headed towards the city wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, the sky had already turned dark. After dinner, the city was filled with a rare, relaxed atmosphere. It was just that the defenses at the top of the city wall were still very tight, as enemies could arrive at any time. This was especially true for the western side of the city wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli whispered to Huo Yuhao after looking at the soldiers at the top and bottom of the city wall, as well as the surveillance soul tools. “Elder brother, how do we leave? The defense is very tight now to prevent enemies from sneaking in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “Compared to the Sun Moon Empire, our Star Luo Empire is far inferior in terms of surveillance soul tools. Such a level of surveillance is completely useless in preventing our enemies from spying on us. Let me tell you, there’s a super-high aerial surveillance soul tool three thousand meters above Imperial Radiant City right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Dai Luoli was shocked. “A surveillance soul tool three thousand meters in the sky?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally speaking, even a Titled Douluo couldn’t fly more than a thousand meters into the sky. The higher one flew, the greater he would be drained. Even with a clear sky, it was impossible to see three thousand meters into the sky. It was already quite commendable if the Star Luo Empire’s ground-based surveillance soul tools could even see five hundred meters into the sky.</span></p>

Otherwise, why would the Sun Moon Empire be daring enough to attack three empires? They are extremely powerful!”</span></p>

However, it’s also very difficult to create a high-altitude aerial surveillance soul tool. There aren’t many of them in the Sun Moon Empire, and each of them is very costly to produce. This is why they can only keep an eye on some important locations, and the clarity of their surveillance isn’t going to be very good.”</span></p>

As they were too far away, it was very difficult to control them. If any mistakes were made, one might immediately lose control of a high-altitude aerial surveillance soul tool. Furthermore, they were located too far from the ground, and thus lost effectiveness when night fell. They were still considered to be in the experimental stage. Evidently, the Sun Moon Empire wanted to use this war to test these soul tools.</span></p>

This was already very useful in a war.</span></p>

It was a pity for the Sun Moon Empire that Huo Yuhao wasn’t any ordinary person.</span></p>

Whenever he was free in the city, he would use his Spiritual Detection to scan the city for any anomalies. His unidirectional detection had an effective range of five kilometers even without his Eye of Destiny. When he scanned the sky, he was able to detect that high-altitude aerial surveillance soul tool!</span></p>
