 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed sarcastically and replied, “Do I have a choice? Whatever you say is final? You’re right. I admit that I don’t want to die. However, will you trust me if I surrender so easily?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lady laughed coldly and said, “I can confirm that this is very simple. I’ll start with understanding who you are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, an object flew towards Huo Yuhao. He didn’t move as it was flung at him, and it landed three meters away from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a pair of dark gold manacles. There was a ring of sharp teeth pointing inwards within the manacles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those are called Godrestricting Manacles. When you put them on, it will restrict your soul power. We can start talking properly then,” the lady said in a very relaxed manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stood there and hesitated for a moment. He revealed a slightly hesitant look in his eyes, “If I put these manacles on, will you really not kill me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lady calmly replied, “I already mentioned that you have no choice. You can only believe me. Moreover, do you think you’d still be alive if I wanted to kill you? Put them on. My words are final.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was both threatening and convincing him. Her tone of voice also sounded very reassuring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stood where he was, his expression changing. That lady didn’t force him any further. She only maintained her silence as she waited for his response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a while, Huo Yuhao let out a long sigh and slowly walked towards those manacles. He was walking very slowly. As he moved, the soul tools that were locked onto him also slowly moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lady smiled and said, “You’re clever. Just like that, walk slowly. Otherwise, I can’t guarantee that my men won’t accidentally discharge their soul tools.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was indeed very slow. He didn’t want to move too quickly. There was a look of helplessness and dejection in his eyes. Finally, he arrived in front of the manacles. He slowly bent at the waist over and moved to put the manacles on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just put them on directly?” Huo Yuhao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, Both hands.” the lady said very patiently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I concede defeat,” Huo Yuhao sighed once more and used the Godrestricting Manacles to cuff himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the soul tools were still locked onto him. However, Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was very sensitive. When he moved to put on the manacles, he immediately sensed that all the soul engineers relaxed slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They didn’t make a mistake; this was a normal human reaction. Any human would react like that under such a circumstance, especially in this icy place. However, Huo Yuhao made his move just as they reacted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Godrestricting Manacles were getting closer and closer to his wrists. To a normal person, this happened in just an instant. However, Huo Yuhao was able to delay this instant through his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The manacles were less than an inch away from his left wrist. At this moment, Huo Yuhao could sense the power of the manacles. He immediately made his judgment; once he was cuffed, one of the cuffs was enough to restrict him completely. He didn’t need to be cuffed on both hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the last inch, Huo Yuhao suddenly moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lights flashed without any warning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao instantly switched positions. An old lady who was around seventy was standing where he was now. She appeared very confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sudden change shocked all of the soul engineers. They had clearly locked onto Huo Yuhao earlier, but he had disappeared now, and caused their lock-on to vanish, too. Many of the soul engineers suddenly fired, as they couldn’t control themselves. However, their attacks were blocked by a layer of light that rose from the old lady’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is not good, commander!” the old lady shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding soul engineers were all in a state of panic. This was because they could recognize that the old lady was the vice-legion commander of the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion. She was a Class 9 soul engineer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The original strict formation changed. Following this, an anxious voice sounded. “I’m fine. Catch him. He’s fake.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old lady revealed a slight smile on her face. Had he finally appeared?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lights flashed again before that old lady disappeared. She was replaced by a tall, big lady who was around forty years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, that old lady earlier was still Huo Yuhao. He had used his Spiritual Interference to isolate all lock-ons before using his Imitation to change his appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had no choice. He still hadn’t managed to trace the original source of the voice using his spiritual power earlier. However, he still managed to discover the Class 9 soul engineer who could threaten him the most using his Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could he stop the enemy from attacking him even after discovering him? Choosing to adopt the appearance of this soul engineer was evidently the wisest choice. This was why Huo Yuhao did this. He only had one motive: to draw the legion commander out from her hiding place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a fact that even the most intelligent hunters could make mistakes when panicking. The reason why that lady’s voice couldn’t be traced by Huo Yuhao earlier was because her emotions didn’t change at all. Using a displacement soul tool, she had managed to conceal herself. Right now, her emotions changed as she panicked. Naturally, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection managed to capture her detailed position. Following this, he used his Xuanwu Displacement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every time Huo Yuhao used his Spiritual Inscription, he would return to find Xu Sanshi to re-inscribe it once again. He promoted it from the Mysterious Underworld Displacement to the Xuanwu Displacement. It was a life-saving change!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Xuanwu Displacement had saved Huo Yuhao on many critical occasions, so he always re-inscribed this soul skill. Whether it was control or attack, he had great self-confidence. While his surveillance was good, his greatest shortcoming was in terms of how well he could escape. The Xuanwu Displacement was undoubtedly the best soul skill to use to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Xuanwu Displacement could teleport Huo Yuhao a greater distance than his Instant Teleportation. Furthermore, there would be a substitute in his place, which made it even more confusing. When used in tandem with his Instant Teleportation, it could bring about unexpected results.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao made a life-saving displacement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through his Spiritual Detection earlier, he was clearly aware that the enemy’s words were right. He was heavily trapped, and it was impossible for him to charge out. A bunch of soul engineers had surrounded him, and linked defensive soul tools were ready to be fired. Even an Ultimate Douluo might not be able to force his way out. It was only by killing and reducing the number of people that he might possibly stand a chance of escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s abilities were still a far ways off from those of an Ultimate Douluo. This was why he only had one chance: he had to capture the leader of the enemy and use her as a hostage to stand a chance of survival. Force him to surrender? In his dictionary, there was no such word!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Huo Yuhao heard exclamations, he had already unleashed his Xuanwu Displacement. Suddenly, he appeared behind a lady wearing red armor. He was trying to displace this person’s bodyguard. From the voice of this person and her attire, he had already determined earlier that she was the marshal who had been speaking earlier. Whether she was the true marshal or not, she had to hold an important position in the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After displacing himself behind this lady, he continued to maintain the appearance of the old lady. All the soul engineers around were astonished, but they didn’t do anything immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t bothered at all. He had already planned his move. His Eye of Destiny had already opened, and his soul core was already revolving extremely quickly. He didn’t conserve his spiritual power as he unleashed it. Immediately, his Spiritual Blast was unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strong spiritual blast was compressed within a hundred square meter region. The soul engineers around were all seven-ringed and Class 7 soul engineers. There were other, even stronger soul engineers that had locked onto Huo Yuhao from different directions earlier. However, these Class 7 soul engineers were not very protected against Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Blast, not to mention that Huo Yuhao had enhanced his Spiritual Blast using his Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, there was no room for error. Huo Yuhao attacked immediately. Even though his Spiritual Blast was strong, the red-armored lady in front of him had actually unleashed a spiritual barrier around her. It managed to resist his blast as they collided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Oh? I’m right, she must be the marshal. How could she not be the marshal, given that she’s equipped with such an expensive defensive soul tool?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao was surprised that her abilities weren’t that strong. She was at most a Soul Sage. He was very confident about this. After understanding the mysteries of soul cores, he had developed a deep understanding of the soul power undulations of Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if she was a Titled Douluo, he still had to take action! This was his only chance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He instantly unleashed his Spiritual Shock. A beam of rose-gold light that seemed to come from prehistoric times flashed before disappearing. Huo Yuhao had already formed his soul core. Along with the enhancement of his Eye of Destiny, he unleashed this strike with all his strength. In terms of power, it had to be the strongest one that he had ever unleashed. It was comparable to the attack of a Titled Douluo.</span></p>

A necklace on her neck snapped and fell off, and the spiritual barrier covering her was destroyed. She even fell forward.</span></p>

He lifted his hand and grabbed hold of her neck. He used his left hand and unleashed his Ice Empress’ Pincer instantly. At the same time, he stomped his right foot on the ground, and his Star Anise Omnithrust was unleashed.</span></p>
