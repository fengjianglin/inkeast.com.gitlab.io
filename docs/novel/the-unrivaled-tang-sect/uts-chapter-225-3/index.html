After all, the Golden Crow Primordial Fire would still burn her once her Invincible Golden Body disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But as a result of her actions, the Golden Crow Primordial Fire Combustion and Golden Crow Primordial Fire Explosion that Wu Ming was going to unleash were sealed, even though her Martial Soul True Body was still active. Jiang Nannan was fighting for this little bit of time for the rest to attack again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An orange-gold figure flew out from Huo Yuhao’s body at this point. In the next moment, Huo Yuhao arrived in front of Wu Ming. He gently tapped her shoulder. At the same time, Huo Yuhao’s Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s third soul ring, the second of his four orange-gold soul rings lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan disappeared just as Huo Yuhao tapped Wu Ming’s shoulder. Her third soul skill helped her to escape after she bought enough time for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His palm was gentle, smooth, and spotless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his palm struck Wu Ming’s shoulder, her entire body started to tremble. The ferocious Golden Crow Primordial Fire that had broken free from the restraint of the Soft Bone Lock was instantly extinguished, as if a basin of ice water had been poured over it. Wu Ming’s body also froze. The golden-red faded from her body, and her Golden Crow True Body seemed to have been dissipated by Huo Yuhao’s gentle palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Empress’ Palm, Snowless Glacier!</span></p>

The Empress’ Palm had to make contact before it could take effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Considering his status, his appraisal of the Snow Empress’ Snowless Glacier showed how strong it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sword and Palm sends the sky into a Chill, the Empress’ Sword, Palm, and Chill. Among these three soul skills, the Empress’ Palm was ranked second. However, it was the strongest of the three in terms of its direct offensive strength. After fusing with the Snow Empress’ Spirit, Huo Yuhao no longer possessed solely Ultimate Ice, but Ultimate Ice and Snow. Among all cold-type soul masters, no one could compare to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even without the enhancement of the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, Huo Yuhao’s Snowless Glacier still managed to achieve a temperature of absolute zero. While the Golden Crow True Body was very strong, the strength of Huo Yuhao’s Snowless Glacier was on display as it struck at such close quarters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Ming felt her shoulder turning numb as it was hit. In the next moment, she discovered that her soul power seemed to have solidified. Her Martial Soul True Body disintegrated instantly, and her entire right arm went numb. Suddenly, a lukewarm feeling started to gush from her shoulder to the rest of her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, it was a lukewarm feeling. However, it gave her chills! Reversal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Huo Yuhao’s palm wasn’t enhanced by the Sovereign’s Descent, it still managed to surprisingly turn the chill into a warm feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Huo Yuhao struck Wu Ming, he also felt something amiss, and pressed his palm down again. But as the warm flow returned to his body, and both he and the Snow Lady started to shine with bright orange light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The attack was absorbed back into Huo Yuhao. Not only was his soul power restored, even the Snow Lady benefited greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Ming unleashed her Golden Crow Primordial Fire once again, but her face had turned pale-white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t know if she would have survived if Huo Yuhao hadn’t absorbed the warm flow in time. However, she knew that it had been gushing straight towards her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What soul skill was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Ming was stunned. The rest of Shrek’s Seven Monsters didn’t continue to attack her after they were informed through Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection. However, the sparring still continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Wu Ming was struck by the Snowless Glacier, Xu Sanshi ran into trouble…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Qingtian couldn’t handle the Turtle God’s Strike, and was forced back. However, there was still a Han Ruoruo behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo lifted her hand as she faced the Turtle God’s Strike and He Caitou’s high-power cannon shell. A golden ring light was unleashed with her body in the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t rush to save Wu Ming, as she knew Wu Ming well, and had absolute confidence in her power. Han Ruoruo believed that Shrek’s Seven Monsters couldn’t defeat Wu Ming easily since she had unleashed her Martial Soul True Body, even if they encircled her. Xu Sanshi didn’t have to bother helping them defeat her, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden ring looked very simple, as if it were a thick arm. It had a diameter of around five meters. However, a shocking scene appeared when the golden ring collided with the Turtle God’s Strike and He Caitou’s high-power cannon shell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom, boom…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two loud booms sounded at the same time. The first to blow apart was the high-power cannon shell. He Caitou chose to fire at this time in order to coordinate with Xu Sanshi. As an advanced-level soul engineer, he had great awareness. In addition, he had Huo Yuhao’s help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the golden ring appeared to be impenetrable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The terrifying impact generated by the high-power cannon shell affected the entire Sparring Arena. A mushroom cloud rose over the entire arena, but Han Ruoruo didn’t move a single step. The golden ring only shook slightly before it collided with the Turtle God’s Strike as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Turtle God’s Strike was a combination of two soul skills, and was unleashed by Xu Sanshi, who possessed the Xuanwu’s blood lineage. As it collided with the golden ring, it created an intense whirlpool that generated a suction force. This whirlpool wasn’t simple, as it could continuously deplete the opponent’s soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the golden ring suddenly divided into three when the Turtle God’s Strike collided with it. They intersected and connected together. As a buzz sounded, they started to pull in three different directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The instant they collided, and as the boom from their collision echoed out, the Turtle God’s Strike was overcome and converted back into countless projections of shields. Eventually, it returned to Xu Sanshi’s shield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi cursed, but before he could react further, a streak of golden light had already entangled him. No matter how he tried to struggle and resist with his shield, the Dazzling Golden Rope still dragged him down. He was restrained like a plump dumpling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Qingtian couldn’t give up such a perfect opportunity. He snuck up behind Xu Sanshi, and a panther projection formed by lightning shone brightly before striking Xu Sanshi’s body forcefully. Suddenly, Xu Sanshi’s body started to flash with lightning. He appeared to be convulsing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Han Ruoruo flung her right hand, Xu Sanshi was thrown forward. Wang Yan made his judgment right there, Xu Sanshi had been eliminated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time the Shrek’s Seven Monsters’ attack had ever been stopped once the Mysterious Underworld Displacement was used. Xu Sanshi just didn’t stand a chance against Han Ruoruo. The rest also started to feel that the Dazzling Golden Rope was going to be difficult to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rope could loosen, tighten, whip, and block. Even when it was tangled, it was flexible. However, it seemed indestructible when it tightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo controlled her martial soul very well. Xu Sanshi was defeated before he could unleash his full strength. Although that was partly due to the fact that Han Ruoruo’s martial soul was very effective at curbing Xu Sanshi’s, it was also undeniable that the gap in their cultivations played a huge part in his defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek’s Seven Monsters were stunned, but Han Ruoruo was equally shocked. She had defeated Xu Sanshi in the shortest time possible. However, she was appalled to discover that the remaining six were all rushing towards her, while Wu Ming didn’t move from her spot. What did it mean for the six of them to turn their backs on her? It meant that she had been defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So quickly? Ming’er only just showed her Golden Crow True Body!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While she was quite puzzled, she also became warier. Her eyes gave off a fierce light, and she snorted. The Dazzling Golden Rope struck forward towards the six of them. She was aiming for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

A crisp, clanging sound rang out as he stood firmly rooted to the ground.</span></p>

The bottom of the disc was conical, and stabbed right into the granite below. He Caitou stood above this disc. Following this, a large number of soul tools started to combine with his body. In a matter of seconds, he had become a metal monster with countless barrels pointing outwards, all aimed at Han Ruoruo.</span></p>

In terms of direct power, it wasn’t Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, Huo Yuhao, or Wang Dong’er. It was He Caitou.</span></p>
