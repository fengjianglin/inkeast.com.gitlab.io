 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, you can’t do that. Return my son. Return my son!” As she screamed, Ju Zi immediately increased her speed and rushed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was already not too far from Huo Yuhao. She also acted very suddenly. Her human-shaped soul tool was the best she could wear. Once its soul thrusters were activated, she almost instantly teleported in front of Huo Yuhao. She reached out for Xu Yunhan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao lifted his hand, and a strong force restrained Ju Zi. She was completely restricted. Right now, Kong Deming knew that it was too late to save her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao spoke coldly as he looked at Ju Zi from close-range. “Leave with your people. I won’t retract my decision after I’ve made it. You must pay the price for your mistake. I trusted you so much before, and even told you about my closed-door cultivation. How did you treat me in return? Now, I can’t bring myself to trust you again. I won’t harm you. Leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Return my son. Return my son to me. I can’t let him leave with you. In your eyes, he’s the Emperor of the Sun Moon Empire. You won’t guide him properly. He is my last hope in life. Yuhao, I beg you. Return my son to me. Return him!” Ju Zi begged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this were the past, Huo Yuhao would have gone soft-hearted. However, the entire Dou Ling Empire had been crushed because of her betrayal. Even the Star Luo Empire was almost annihilated, and the White Tiger Duke had almost died at her hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hardened his stance and forcibly shook his head. “Leave! There’s nothing more to say.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No--!” Ju Zi shouted. “Huo Yuhao, you can’t do this. You can’t do this. Yunhan, Yunhan is your son!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Space seemed to collapse. Just when Ju Zi said this, space within a region spanning a hundred meters in diameter collapsed. Her voice was completely drowned in that space. Only those within this region heard what she said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time and space seemed to stop at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were both astonished. So was the White Tiger Duke. Their expressions froze. Ju Zi was still sobbing. Little Yunhan was stunned. He lifted his head and looked at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This strange scene just paused in the sky like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dignified voice sounded all of a sudden and echoed in their ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I told you before – never reveal this secret. If you reveal it, I’ll take your son’s life. It seems like you’ve forgotten my words. In that case…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bright beam of golden light shone. Huo Yuhao, Tang Wutong, Dai Hao, Ju Zi and Xu Yunhan only felt as if everything was spinning in front of them. In the next instant, they came to another place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When everything became clear once again, they were astonished to discover that they were above a golden patch of clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even with Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s cultivations, they couldn’t sense where they were right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that they weren’t thinking of this at the moment. Huo Yuhao’s gaze was fixated on Ju Zi. He lost his voice as he asked, “What, what did you say? Whose son is this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was already pale-white by now. The dignified voice left her horrified. She quickly grabbed Xu Yunhan. After this, she kneeled down. “No, please, I beg of you. Don’t harm my son. It wasn’t intentional. I was just afraid that he would harm my son! Please, please don’t hurt my son.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao only managed to turn around right now. He also unleashed his Spiritual Detection. However, he was stunned to realize that he couldn’t sense any changes around him, even with his immense spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s going on? Where is this place?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stupefied as he tried to make sense of everything around him. He couldn’t understand what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a beam of golden light shone in front of everyone. That dignified voice spoke once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aren’t you afraid of harming someone else’s kid if you are so afraid of harming your own? I’ve already tolerated this fellow for a long time. But heaven is benevolent. However, you still blurted it out. Hatred has blinded you and caused you to lose control of your emotions. You’re walking towards destruction. I’ll grant you your wish since that’s the case.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A golden figure slowly became clearer and clearer. A handsome man who seemed to be only twenty years old appeared in front of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had long flowing blue hair that drooped all the way down to his feet. If not for his burly figure and broad shoulders, one might mistake him for a lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were ripples on his long blue robe. Upon closer look, one would be captivated by the ocean-blue on his robe. His entire soul might even be absorbed into this ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the guy seemed to be only twenty, the look in his eyes was very deep. It looked very hollow, but it seemed to contain everything at the same time. At times, there would be a purplish, moving flash that felt as if he could kill with a blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was carrying a huge golden trident with his right hand. This trident was very familiar to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He, he was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Daddy!” Tang Wutong suddenly shouted. Her figure flashed, and she leapt into the embrace of that young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue-haired youth opened his arms wide and hugged her. There was a benevolent look on his face. He gently caressed Tang Wutong’s pinkish-blue hair. “My dear daughter, don’t worry. Daddy won’t let you suffer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong turned around and looked at Huo Yuhao. Right now, the look in her eyes was already different. She was intelligent. From Ju Zi’s words and her father’s rage, she knew that her claim was probably true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Daddy, does this kid really belong to Yuhao and Ju Zi?” Her voice was trembling when she said this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue-haired youth nodded. “That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong started to tear up. She looked at Huo Yuhao and seemed to be shaking. She spoke as if she was heartbroken. “Why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s mouth was already wide open as he tried to explain himself, “Wutong, listen to me. I don’t know either! It’s impossible that he belongs to me. Impossible! I’ve never done it with Ju Zi. I’ve never! I admit to liking her before knowing you were a girl. However, we’ve only been friends. We’ve never been together at all. It’s not real. This kid isn’t mine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue-haired youth laughed coldly, “Not yours? Xu Yunhan, do you know why he’s called Xu Yunhan? It’s because his name is compatible with yours. Do you really think it’s a coincidence? Ju Zi, tell him. Is this his child?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi hugged Xu Yunhan tightly. When she looked at Huo Yuhao before turning to Tang Wutong and that blue-haired youth, she was already so dazed until she couldn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person with the dignified voice was actually Tang Wutong’s father. No wonder he forced her not to speak. He didn’t want his daughter to know anything!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I beg you, please don’t hurt my child. I beg you. I’m only a poor mother. I’m only afraid of my son being hurt! Please, I beg you.” Ju Zi didn’t explain, and only kowtowed towards the blue-haired youth while hugging Xu Yunhan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tears flowed down Tang Wutong’s face. Her eyes were already red when she looked at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No woman could forgive her man for having a child with another woman! No matter how much she liked him, she could only feel sorrowful and enraged right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue-haired youth looked coldly at Ju Zi. “You turned a deaf ear to my words. You shall pay the price!” As he spoke, he lifted his hand. A streak of blue light flashed, and Xu Yunhan disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already in his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi frantically tried to leap over. However, space had been frozen. The blue-haired youth looked coldly at her. He already had his hand around Xu Yunhan’s neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let go of him!” A furious scream sounded. A figure charged forward and smacked a pair of tiger palms towards the blue-haired youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the White Tiger Duke, Dai Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the earlier conversation, he knew that the kid probably belonged to Huo Yuhao. Although he didn’t know why Huo Yuhao suddenly became his son, he knew that if Huo Yuhao was his son, Xu Yunhan was his biological grandson!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder the War God Empress said that she can’t kill me earlier.</span></p>
