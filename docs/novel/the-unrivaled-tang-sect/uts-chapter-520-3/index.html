 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had not forgotten his graduation test. He had already produced two Class 9 stationary soul cannon shells for Shrek Academy. As for challenging Dean Yan Shaozhe, he had not done so, as he was in closed-door cultivation. However, two out of the three years that the academy had given him had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, Huo Yuhao had wanted to become a Titled Douluo first before challenging Yan Shaozhe along with Tang Wutong. Should that happen, he would be more confident. However, it seemed like he couldn’t do it before completing this mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan nodded and said, “Alright, this mission is tough enough. We’ll use it as your graduation test. I can also promise you that you won’t need to challenge Shaozhe after you finish this mission. It would mean that you are qualified enough to graduate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Elder Xuan’s words, everyone’s expressions turned weird. Huo Yuhao’s graduation test could be the most difficult in the history of Shrek Academy. At least, no one had done something like this before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and replied, “Alright, I’ll go on this mission, then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Xuan, I’ll go with him.” Tang Wutong said without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned his head to look at her and shook his head seriously. He could take the risk, but he was not bringing Tang Wutong along with him on this dangerous mission. Even though he knew that his fighting strength was much greater with her around, it was not something that he wanted. There was nothing more important than her safety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong also looked at him and smiled. She said, “If you don’t let me go, I’ll play hide and seek with you again. Do you think it’s better for me to remain by your side and be protected by you, or for me to leave and you to be unable to find me when you get back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Her words stumped Huo Yuhao. He couldn’t possibly run the risk of losing her again. Suddenly, there was a bitter smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong said seriously, “I’m not trying to scare you. I’m thinking of a way to bring my father here to see you. If you leave and my father comes, he’ll insist on leaving with me. I can’t reject him. This is why I can only follow you to ensure that we are always together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t say anything else, and only laughed bitterly. “You can follow me, but you have to listen to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s expression turned gentler, and she hugged his arm, saying, “Since when have I disobeyed you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned red. It wasn’t that he was easily embarrassed. It was because this was a conference in the Sea God’s Pavilion! They had to be the first couple to do this in the Sea God’s Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei held in his laughter and lowered his head. The elders didn’t have any misgivings, and only started chuckling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan smiled, “Younger people are indeed more energetic! Alright, we’ll do it this way. Yuhao and Wutong will go. Yuhao will be the leader. If Wutong doesn’t listen to you, I give you permission to smack her butt.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Tang Wutong was the one who turned red. She complained, “Elder Xuan, you’re teaching him the wrong things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan laughed and said, “I’m always like this. You should have known when you first met me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wasn’t he right? When they first met him, he was a drunkard. Apart from drinking, he was always eating chicken drumsticks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said, “Elder Xuan, should the Tang Sect send a few more people to follow Yuhao and Wutong? I’m still a little worried. The Sun Moon Empire…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan gestured and replied, “No, it’s not always better with more people. It might be easier to escape with fewer people. Given Yuhao and Wutong’s abilities, they should be able to escape easily. Yuhao, you must remember that you aren’t the one leading this mission. It’s mainly being spearheaded by those from the three empires in the Douluo Continent. What you have to do is coordinate with them. Don’t risk your life. When it comes to the assassination, you don’t have to be a part of it. This was why I agreed with them. Otherwise, I wouldn’t let you go. Your job is to help conceal everyone. Once you meet with any danger, you must quickly abscond no matter what. You must treat your safety as the first priority. Understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and answered, “Elder Xuan, I know my limits. I’ll do my best to help them. If it doesn’t work out, I won’t force the issue.” He might still be willing to risk his own life if it was before finding Tang Wutong. As for now, he wanted to safely live out his life with Tang Wutong! He was more afraid of death than anyone else!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this, issues regarding Shrek City and the training of the soul engineer legions were discussed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, Shrek Academy’s three soul engineer legions had been established. They had been fully equipped half a year ago. Right now, the soul engineers were undergoing training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the soul engineer legions to demonstrate their greatest fighting strength, it was something that couldn’t be accomplished overnight. They had to coordinate perfectly with one another first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As one of the three soul engineer legion commanders, Huo Yuhao still hadn’t had a chance to train with his own soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the strength of the three soul engineer legions could be seen after all the continuous training. They now had a certain standard of fighting strength. However, everything regarding these three soul engineer legions was being kept a secret. Even the three empires in the original Douluo Continent didn’t know anything about these three soul engineer legions. They only knew that Shrek Academy would be using them to deal with the Sun Moon Empire in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, the Tang Sect strengthened the equipment of the three soul engineer legions, especially in terms of stationary soul cannon shells. After Huo Yuhao succeeded in inventing Class 4 stationary soul cannon shells using simplified materials, many more stationary soul cannon shells were produced over the past two years.Some of them were left in Shrek City, while the rest of them were sold to the three empires as a means of strengthening their armies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the Tang Sect also used the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons to increase their revenue. In just a short two years, the Tang Sect’s wealth had increased significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the exact numbers, Huo Yuhao wasn’t very clear. Bei Bei was the one settling it. Compared to the others, he and Tang Wutong’s most important mission was to increase their own cultivation. After all, they would be the Tang Sect’s greatest fighting strength in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The conference only ended after two hours. Elder Xuan kept Huo Yuhao and Yang Wutong behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he watched the rest leave, Elder Xuan nodded at the two of them and said, “Follow me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan brought both of them into his room. Huo Yuhao closed the door and excitedly said, “Elder Xuan, congratulations once again. You’ve finally become an Ultimate Douluo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan sighed and said, “It’s not easy to become an Ultimate Douluo! I finally found some tricks to doing it. It’s going to be as difficult for you to become a Titled Douluo as it was for me to become an Ultimate Douluo. One problem you’ll face is the formation of your second soul core. You can only become a Titled Douluo by forming your second soul core. However, once you succeed, there’ll be no one as strong as you. This is because you’ll have two soul cores. These two soul cores will help you to become a Transcendent Douluo as quickly as possible. Of course, you’ll need to learn how to form your third soul core when you want to become an Ultimate Douluo in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes brightened. He knew that Elder Xuan wanted to impart some tricks for forming his second soul core. It was right in time. Right now, he was most concerned about when he could become a Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he formed his first soul core, he was very confident. He felt that it wasn’t going to be difficult for him to form his second soul core in the future. At most, he would only be stuck at a bottleneck for some time. However, over the past nine months, he had been struggling at this bottleneck. It was only then that he realized how scary it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the process of forming his second soul core, his first soul core would undoubtedly be involved. He couldn’t stabilize his second soul core even with his spiritual power. At the start, he couldn’t even form a soul power whirlpool. Although his control had increased over time, he couldn’t stabilize his soul power whirlpool every time. It would be destroyed quickly. From there, he lost all chance of making a breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan said, “If you want to form your second soul core, the greatest problem is not with your cultivation. With my cultivation, I could have already become an Ultimate Douluo. The real problem is with your control – control over your soul power, spiritual power, and your first soul core.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded. What Elder Xuan mentioned were the problems he was facing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan said, “The successful formation of your first soul core can greatly help you to compress your soul power and make it even more immense. When the quality of your soul power improves by leaps and bounds, you’ll experience massive improvements in terms of the strength, volume and restoration ability of your soul power. This is why your abilities transform significantly when you become a Titled Douluo. The formation of your second soul core will differ greatly from the formation of your first soul core. This is also why it’ll be so difficult for you to become an Ultimate Douluo. The formation of your second soul core can occur in many different ways, according to my years of experience. These different ways will lead to different effects.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Oh? There are different ways of forming my second soul core?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan’s words undoubtedly opened another door for Huo Yuhao. He listened to Elder Xuan very seriously along with Tang Wutong. These were exactly the problems that they were facing.</span></p>

All your soul power will circulate around it as the center. Simply put, your first soul core is like a circle, and all your soul power revolves around it. Your first soul core has a great impact on your soul power. This is why your soul power can be compressed as much as possible using your first soul core.”</span></p>
