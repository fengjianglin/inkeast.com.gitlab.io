After all, Huo Yuhao was only a Soul King. In terms of individual abilities, Huo Yuhao was at most the fourth strongest in the Tang Sect. In addition, Huo Yuhao was a control-type soul master, and he was even crippled. He wasn’t much of a threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Na also furrowed her brow in the waiting area. She didn’t understand why the Tang Sect would send Huo Yuhao up first. From their looks earlier, they must have had guessed something. Wasn’t a control-type soul master like Huo Yuhao supposed to be reserved for the team round?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She also revealed a pensive look as she thought about that. As she recalled how sly Huo Yuhao was during their negotiation earlier, Wei Na couldn’t help but develop an ominous feeling…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

They waited on opposing sides of Zheng Zhan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Both parties, please report your names,” Zheng Zhan said formally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tang Sect, Huo Yuhao.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng was more than one hundred and ninety centimeters tall. His body was big and burly. The white attire that he wore was very tight. He had short hair, and his eyes were filled with energy. Although he wasn’t very handsome, he gave off a very mature feeling. His sharp eyes seemed able to penetrate a person’s heart. Although they hadn’t started competing yet, Huo Yuhao could sense a dominant aura from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Zhan looked at both parties and said, “Step back and prepare for the start of the fight. Let me reiterate, try not to go too hard on your opponent. When I judge that either of you can’t handle it anymore, I will end this fight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although only Huo Yuhao’s right arm could move, he was very deft as he controlled his wheelchair. He rolled his wheelchair back to his side of the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng didn’t say anything either. He only nodded at Huo Yuhao before turning to the other side of the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, both parties got into their respective positions. They turned around and faced each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Zhan raised his hand up high and shouted, “Begin!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng immediately moved. His toes pushed off as he burst towards Huo Yuhao. He was very quick, but wasn’t as violent as Wang Qiu’er. However, he seemed illusory throughout the entire process. It seemed as if he was bursting forward, but Huo Yuhao couldn’t lock onto him, even with his Spiritual Detection!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng was moving from side to side at an extremely high speed. Huo Yuhao immediately made his judgment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both parties unleashed their martial souls at almost the same time. Huo Yuhao had two yellow, two purple, and one black soul ring. Everyone from the Tang Sect knew he was using his Imitation now. Apart from Wang Dong’er, no one really knew the colors of Huo Yuhao’s soul rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Six soul rings rose from Wang Yanfeng’s feet. There were two yellow, two purple, and two black soul rings. His aura also grew stronger and stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t move a single centimeter, remaining in his position. His right hand pointed forward, and a petite figure shot out from his brow. She grew in size as she moved, and turned into the appearance of a little girl, drifting two meters in front of Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once the little Snow Lady appeared, the temperature around Huo Yuhao quickly fell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng seemed to slow down as he burst forward. He had evidently unleashed his martial soul, but nothing could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was his martial soul?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If not for the fact that Huo Yuhao had formulated his guess before the fight even started, he would have been in a spot right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng was less than thirty meters from the Snow Lady right now. At this point, he suddenly shouted and jumped forward. His legs landed steadily on the ground, and he clenched his fists while raising his hands up. After that, he hammered his fists down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was still thirty meters from Huo Yuhao and the Snow Lady right now, so it wasn’t possible for his fists to strike them. He was hammering the ground!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bronze-green glow spread from his fists. As his fists pounded the ground, there wasn’t any sound at all. However, a wave of green gas swept towards Huo Yuhao and the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a very strong shockwave!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was in awe. His opponent’s attack wasn’t unleashed using pure strength and soul power. It involved some level of technique and strength control. It was a combination of strength and technique. He was indeed a talent from the Body Sect! Were his fists his martial soul? In the younger generation of the Body Sect, Wang Yanfeng should be one of the best...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao squinted as he faced the green gust of gas. The Snow Lady didn’t resist it directly. On the contrary, her petite figure drifted back and landed on Huo Yuhao’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao raised his only moveable hand. A strong golden glow lit up on his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following this, a golden figure appeared from his body. It wasn’t quick, but it appeared just before the green gust of gas reached him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi...</span></p>

The figure seemed to chop it down the middle, and the two halves struck the protective barriers around the stage. A huge glow was instantly created.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Neither parties used any soul skills in their first confrontation. The rest of their team members in the waiting area were in awe, especially the Snowdemon Sect. Their team members were stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t use his ability to summon things, but used his own soul power to tackle Wang Yanfeng. In addition, he didn’t seem to have expended much energy as he overcame Wang Yanfeng’s attack. They were all shocked by this level of skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t retract his palm. He clenched it into a fist and pushed it forward. Suddenly, a golden force was unleashed from his fist towards Wang Yanfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pure battle of soul power! There weren’t any soul skills involved!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s actually able to combine his spiritual and soul power! Whose fighting skill did he inherit?” Wei Na muttered to herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng was equally stunned. When they had researched Huo Yuhao’s abilities earlier, they were completely different!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was this even possible for a control-type soul master? Isn’t this a fighting method of our Body Sect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the most important principles that the Body Sect had was that its disciples should never use their soul skills lightly, because their opponents would become familiar with one’s soul skills after each use. They should only be used at the most critical moments in order to achieve a decisive effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, the Body Sect was considered one of the best in terms of their research into fighting techniques. In this aspect, even Shrek Academy couldn’t compare to them. It was also one of the reasons why the Body Sect was so strong.</span></p>

From how he resisted Wang Yanfeng’s attack earlier, it showed that he wasn’t ordinary either! His ability to counterattack in such a short period of time showed that he was indeed very strong.</span></p>

He took a step forward with his right foot and allowed his aura to rise. At the same time, he pounded his fists down again, and a blinding bronze-green glow was unleashed towards the force that Huo Yuhao had shot at him.</span></p>

The golden and green glows dispersed. Huo Yuhao didn’t move from where he was sitting in his wheelchair. Wang Yanfeng looked backward and retreated one step.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao exerted a force from a mid-range distance, while Wang Yanfeng used his body to defend against it, but Wang Yanfeng was the one who suffered. This signified that Wang Yanfeng was inferior to Huo Yuhao in terms of his cultivation. How was this possible? He was one of the strongest from the Body Sect, and was even a Soul Emperor! On the other hand, Huo Yuhao was only a Soul King!</span></p>

When he steadied himself, he burst towards Huo Yuhao without any hesitation. He opened his arms, and his first soul ring finally lit up. His arms grew to three times their original size. He attacked Huo Yuhao’s head as he began to glow with an intense bronze-green light.</span></p>

As their bodies were part of their martial souls, their soul skills usually enhanced a certain part of their body. Without outstanding fighting techniques, it was impossible for them to tap into their advantage to the fullest.</span></p>

With his Spiritual Detection, he could clearly sense the circulation and undulations of his opponent’s soul power, as well as his strengths and weaknesses.</span></p>

His aura dropped significantly.</span></p>

When Huo Yuhao unleashed his palm, it felt as if the weather had changed, and a sovereign was descending!</span></p>
