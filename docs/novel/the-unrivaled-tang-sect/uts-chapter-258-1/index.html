 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh. He wasn’t willing to receive too much help from her so that he could prevent their feelings from developing. However, he was still relieved when Wang Qiu’er did catch up with him. His exploration attempt would be a lot more relaxed than before with her around, and he would also be a lot safer than otherwise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His soul protective barrier enveloped Wang Qiu’er within it, so she stopped releasing her golden flames to defend herself, and the two of them landed on the ground as if they had been together the whole time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were back in that rainbow-colored world, but they were a lot more familiar with their surroundings from their previous experience. Huo Yuhao pulled Wang Qiu’er along the moment they landed and ran towards the edge of the ravine where the Jade Phosphorous Flower of the Seven Absolutes was growing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why aren’t you breaking through the middle? Have you forgotten its location?” Wang Qiu’er asked confusedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “You said it before, I don’t know what unforeseen dangers I may face over there, so I can’t just break through the middle. It will be too late if I run into any contingencies and I have to deal with them on the spot. Furthermore, I also want to test the extent to which these Jade Phosphorous Flowers are afraid of the cold.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er glanced at him coldly, and that noble and aloof feeling made Huo Yuhao feel as if he was being looked down on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I thought you weren’t afraid of dying. Why don’t you just throw your life in and get it over with? So, you’re afraid of dying after all. I guess I overestimated you before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao snapped, “Why would we want to die if we can live? That’s enough, let’s not bicker. We are consuming soul power. Take the Milk Bottle, and I’ll have a go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao gave a Milk Bottle to Wang Qiu’er just in case she needed it, and the two of them stopped about thirty meters away from the Jade Phosphorous Flowers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Jade Phosphorous Poison Clouds produced by these flowers were still gathered together, but they didn’t permeate too far outside, and only loomed over the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their mentality had been greatly affected after their initial astonishment when they first saw these flowers, but Huo Yuhao began to feel something different now that he was back here for the second time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s too neat... Qiu’er, don’t you feel like these flowers are arranged too neatly? Why do I feel like someone did this?” Huo Yuhao lowered his voice as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was momentarily stunned, and couldn’t be bothered with bickering anymore. “Now that you mention it, it does seem like it...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao flipped his right hand, and a water bag appeared in his hands. He released Wang Qiu’er’s hand, and she naturally shifted behind his back as she pressed her right palm against his back so that they could maintain their martial soul fusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao opened the water bottle and poured out the water from inside. The water that was poured out was immediately frozen in midair by his Ultimate Ice soul power, and a large sphere of ice quickly appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er looked on as Huo Yuhao did all this, a strange feeling surfacing in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This guy seems to trust me a lot, I’m pressing against a vital point on his back! If I channel my soul power, I can break his nerves and end his life. He’s not afraid of that? Hmph… why should I even kill him? Killing him will dirty my hands,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er thought to herself arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sphere of ice was roughly a foot in diameter. Huo Yuhao’s left hand was holding it up, and gradually turned icy-blue, while the temperature within his protective barrier began to plummet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his wrist, and the enormous ball of ice flew out as it spun through the air. Huo Yuhao was a disciple of the Tang Sect, and he had great control over his fingers and wrists. He was using one of the Tang Sect’s hidden weapon techniques as he hurled the ball of ice, which emanated an icy-blue radiance as it flew straight out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The multicolored miasma was extremely powerful, and immediately seemed like it was about to attach itself to the sphere of ice once it appeared. However, this sphere of ice contained Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice, so how could the miasma attach itself to it so easily? The multicolored particles were blown in all directions wherever this sphere of extreme chill went, and it was clear that the toxic miasma was severely affected after the water vapor inside was frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sphere pierced through the multicolored miasma, and it finally arrived at the bluish-green Jade Phosphorous Poison Clouds. Just as Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er had speculated before, these poison clouds were controlled by those flowers that had evolved into the Jade Phosphorous Flower of the Nine Absolutes, which were plant-type soul beasts. Large patches of poison clouds were stirred up once this sphere of ice plunged into them, and the bluish-green mist poured forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, every kind of poison mist or gas had a unique characteristic… they definitely contained some water within them. Pure smoke or mist dissipated extremely quickly, and there was no way it could drift through the air for a prolonged period of time, and it would be blown away by the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once the poison clouds approached the sphere of ice, Huo Yuhao could see that the poison mist was pouring forward into the chill from his Ultimate Ice, while it produced large volumes of bluish-green particles that drifted in all directions. The area that the poison clouds covered would then increase for an instant, but then quickly thin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s experiment clearly wasn’t as simple as tossing the sphere through the clouds, and he raised his left hand as he clenched it tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ball of ice immediately exploded, and the Ice Explosion that Huo Yuhao had infused into it unleashed its full force. A violent explosive force immediately caused the sphere to dissipate into countless ice particles that flew in all directions, while the shockwaves swept towards the Jade Phosphorous Flowers around them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was already using his Spiritual Detection to meticulously observe how the flowers reacted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flowers surrounding the vigorous explosion began to sway and tremble like tidal waves, but they were a lot tougher than Huo Yuhao had expected. He had infused Ice Explosion into that sphere of ice, but he wasn’t able to blow away even a single petal, and he only managed to make them sway and shake, while their bodies were undamaged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strange scene occurred just when Huo Yuhao was feeling a little disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bluish-green flowers quickly closed up, as if they were children who were drawing their blankets over themselves because they were afraid of the cold. The flowers ten meters around the explosion closed up, and the poison clouds in that region became a lot thinner than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">are&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">afraid of the cold!” Huo Yuhao was elated. A thought surfaced in his mind as orange-gold light radiated, and the tiny Snow Lady came out from the middle of his eyebrows and hovered next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao hurriedly told the Snow Lady not to leave his soul protective barrier through his mind, so that she wouldn’t be hurt by the poisonous clouds outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yi yi ya ya!” The Snow Lady’s big dark-blue eyes flowed with indifference and contempt. She pointed at the poison clouds outside before she waved her tiny and tender little fingers at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was shocked as he asked, “You’re not afraid of poison?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yi yi ya ya!” The Snow Lady gave him an affirmative answer before she flew out of the protective barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was just feeling a little worried as the orange-gold light on her body began to sparkle. Intense chills billowed from her body as the humid miasma in the air began to transform subtly. Large patches of multicolored miasma swiftly began to dissipate as if they had encountered something terrifying, and uncountable multicolored particles drifted to the ground while the air around them cleared up.</span></p>

The toxic clouds that they had so feared were like nothing before the little Snow Lady. What was going on?</span></p>

Ultimate Ice is the best counter to all the toxins in the world. Didn’t you know that? Useless!” Skydream’s lazy voice appeared in Huo Yuhao’s mind.</span></p>

The poisonous clouds around them were instantly dispelled, and there wasn’t much left to threaten them at all.</span></p>

Let’s take a look and see if we can venture deeper into the valley.”</span></p>

The intense chill from the Snow Lady’s body was a lot stronger than the sphere of ice from before, and both the multicolored miasma and the Jade Phosphorous Poison Clouds had no way of fending her off. The flowers closed up one by one as the extreme chill assaulted them, while the surrounding poison clouds dissipated continuously, and could no longer threaten the two of them.</span></p>

The Jade Phosphorous Flowers were extremely poisonous, and were naturally untouchable, but they had their flying-type soul tools. The little Snow Lady landed on Huo Yuhao, and the orange-gold light that she released became their best defense.</span></p>

However, the mass of Jade Phosphorous flowers wasn’t that wide, and it didn’t take long before they pierced through the ravine of death and arrived next to the edge of the valley.</span></p>

Multicolored miasma was still concentrated within the Jade Phosphorous Poison Clouds, and they blocked Huo Yuhao’s vision to a large extent.</span></p>

They had discovered that Ultimate Ice was a natural counter to acute poison, so the ominous and perilous feeling in her mind was greatly reduced.</span></p>
