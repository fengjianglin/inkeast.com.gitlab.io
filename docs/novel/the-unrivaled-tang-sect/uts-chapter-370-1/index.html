 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Go, go, third elder brother, beat him up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi did not know what to say. He did not know how this girl, who did not even have a boyfriend, knew so much about this subject.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when he turned to look at Huo Yuhao, the look in his eyes changed. At that moment, Xu Sanshi stood upright, and his body felt like an immovable mountain that would never fall to everyone. Before he even released his martial soul, faint black air swirled around him, making him appear even heavier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao, however, gave off a different feel. Compared to Xu Sanshi’s weightiness, Huo Yuhao was like a snowflake. It seemed impossible to grab onto him. While he stood there, he seemed to not exist. The aura Xu Sanshi gave off disappeared by the time it reached Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi nodded and said, “You’ve changed indeed, little junior brother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao raised his right hand and replied, “Third senior brother, please!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright,” Xu Sanshi replied as he took a step forward. The black light from his body started to shine intensely as dark ripples rushed toward Huo Yuhao, just like in his fight against Nan Qiuqiu and Ye Guyi. Darkness which enveloped heaven and earth surged toward Huo Yuhao like a giant beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Nan Qiuqiu and Ye Guyi saw this, their mouths twitched, unhappy with Xu Sanshi. Earlier, in their fight against him, he was not so careful. The martial soul he released was not as powerful, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi thought in her heart,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Can one Soul Emperor and one Soul King be weaker than Huo Yuhao?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They did not know that Xu Sanshi was even warier of Huo Yuhao than they thought. After knowing Huo Yuhao for so many years, Xu Sanshi had seen the full strength of his little junior brother many times. In his heart, he had never viewed him as a mere Soul King. Not only did Huo Yuhao have countless abilities and an extremely flexible fighting style, but Sanshi also did not know how powerful Yuhao had become after his closed-door cultivation. All he knew was that Huo Yuhao and his Spirit Eyes were a big reason why Shrek’s Seven Monsters could achieve such results in the past two tournaments. Huo Yuhao’s role was far bigger than his own!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Faced with the black light that surged toward him, Huo Yuhao smiled and nodded. “Third elder brother has improved drastically indeed! Your Xuanwu’s Domain has been absorbed into your soul power already. This should be a complete fusion with your martial soul, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he struck out, too. Five soul rings rose from underneath his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The colors of the five soul rings were shocking indeed. The first one was blood-red with four golden streaks. The rest were orange-gold. When the five soul rings appeared, the temperature of the Sparring Arena dropped. Two figures appeared behind Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two shadows were shocking to behold. They were both women. The one on the left had a clear, but cold expression on her face, and wore an emerald-green dress. Due to the illusory nature of the light, one could not see her face clearly. However, her jade-green eyes, which brimmed with a conquering aura, were extremely clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Opposite her was a girl clad in a white dress. She was as regal and haughty as ice and snow. She gazed down on all creation arrogantly and had a pair of deep blue eyes like glaciers which had existed for more than ten thousand years, shocking and moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two figures appeared, everything around Huo Yuhao changed, too. When the black light surging toward him was only five meters away from him, it turned into snowflakes. The air was windless, yet the snowflakes swirled around Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene could only be described as ‘strange’. Even Xu Sanshi was shocked by it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little junior brother, that’s not nice,” he said as he reacted immediately. He lifted his right hand and slapped out at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the colors of the sky changed, and the light around them dimmed. In mid-air, the giant Xuanwu Shield appeared. Like a cloud that obscured the sun, it covered the sky above Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The huge turtle and the blood-red snake on the shield came alive. Both brimmed with powerful auras. Like a mountain, it crashed down on Huo Yuhao’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stood there unmoving. His expression became as gentle as sunlight as he looked into the distance. In his eyes, there was only one emotion, and that was melancholy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A golden figure appeared and flashed past the two cold figures behind him. Compared to the two other figures, this one was way too real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long hair billowed down her back. Her entire body was golden. Was that not Wang Dong’er? This was not the Goddess of Light, but Wang Dong’e! Her hair was straight, not wavy. This was Huo Yuhao’s Wang Dong’er, his beloved!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden figure appeared in front of <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao</span> and then turned to look at him. They stared at each other, and Huo Yuhao’s eyes turned misty. At the same time, an indescribable aura could be felt from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a bright-golden sword light. The sword light was not long, only three feet in length. However, it appeared between Huo Yuhao and the golden figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword light flashed, blocking the falling Xuanwu Shield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a clangor, the Xuanwu Shield started to vibrate vigorously. As it shook, the golden sword light did not dissipate, but instead remained firm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden Wang Dong’er took a step forward as she entered Huo Yuhao’s body. Huo Yuhao’s body turned smooth and clear. It was the same color Xu Sanshi had seen in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took a step forward and punched out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This punch looked very simple. Anyone could do it. However, the moment he punched, the expression on Xu Sanshi’s face changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Xuanwu Shield appeared in front of him instantly, and he stepped back with his right foot. His left leg twisted sideways as he stood in this classic stance. At the same time, countless layers of light appeared on top of his Xuanwu Shield, which now shone with black light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu and Ye Guyi suddenly felt like vomiting blood. They discovered, to their shock, that the space in the Sparring Arena appeared to have collapsed completely the moment Huo Yuhao punched out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge explosion resounded in the air, and Xu Sanshi slid back three feet behind his Xuanwu Shield before he managed to straighten himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao lifted his right hand immediately. As he did that, the two figures behind him disappeared. The clear light on his body glowed even more intensely and became unbelievably sharp. At that moment, Huo Yuhao’s entire body was like a sword which had left its scabbard!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His right palm came down.</span></p>

All one could see was a distorted ray of clear light dropping from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Oddly, Huo Yuhao’s eyes were still dazed and lost. He did not seem to be fighting Xu Sanshi, but instead appeared to be thinking of Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fourth soul ring on Xu Sanshi’s body started to shine as he used his Xuanwu Displacement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a defensive soul master, he was extremely sensitive to his opponent’s attack strength. While he told himself in his heart that Huo Yuhao could not hurt him at his level, the moment Huo Yuhao raised his right palm, a powerful sense of danger forced him to unleash his fourth soul skill. He wanted to displace Huo Yuhao to reduce the accuracy of his attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, something shocking happened to Xu Sanshi.
