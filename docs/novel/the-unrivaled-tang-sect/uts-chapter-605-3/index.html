 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A beam of purplish-gold light flashed. Zhong Liwu shook heavily as he screamed hysterically. The look in his eyes dimmed instantly before it gradually lost its color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter who came, Huo Yuhao was still determined to kill him. As the sect leader of the Holy Ghost Church, he had to die. This was non-negotiable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From this moment, the Holy Ghost Church had wiped off the face of this earth. This evil soul master sect, which had harmed many lives, was forever gone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Human, you’ve offended my dignity. You need to pay the price.” The Evileye Tyrant King’s voice sounded. Following this, a dark red beam of light that was more than a kilometer long descended from the sky. It engulfed both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was once been subjected to the Evileye Tyrant King’s attack. Back then, he had relied on his Spiritual Immunity to avert disaster before he fled the Evildemon Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, he was no longer the same Huo Yuhao who had only just become a Soul Sage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes were full of passion. Behind him, his huge vertical eye suddenly brightened. A rose-gold radiance instantly shone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was his Martial Soul True Body, the Eye of the Asura!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the dark red beam of light that descended from the sky, the rose-gold light that Huo Yuhao emitted was evidently weaker. The two beams of light clashed in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gloomy clouds shook tremendously. The huge dark red beam was blocked just like that. Its color was also quickly changing. There was an extra layer of icy-blue light around it. Furthermore, it was moving back towards its origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Shock! Huo Yuhao had unleashed the true strength of his Yin-Yang Complement soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” The Evileye Tyrant King was astonished as he groaned. After this, the dark-red beam of light quickly retracted all the way until it was only ten meters long. After this a terrifying spiritual windstorm was unleashed in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky instantly turned red, as if it were a patch of bloody sea. Tremendous spiritual undulations caused all the soul beasts in the Evildemon Forest to lie prone on the ground. They didn’t dare to move at all. They felt the rage coming from the Evileye Tyrant King. Here, the Evileye Tyrant King was the sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong came to Huo Yuhao’s side. She saw how serious Huo Yuhao was. After one clash, Huo Yuhao’s nose and mouth were already bleeding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’s really capable of challenging Di Tian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When their spiritual powers clashed, Huo Yuhao felt an indescribable pressure. The Evileye Turant King had actually fused both his immense spiritual and spatial power. Huo Yuhao had fused his Ultimate Ice into his spiritual power, whereas the Evileye Turant King’s spiritual power was filled with a raging spatial storm. The terrifying spatial power almost tore Huo Yuhao’s spiritual origin apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go up.” Huo Yuhao held Tang Wutong’s hand. They rose up and turned into projections. Instantly, they were high up in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had sworn not to easily kill soul beasts. There were many soul beasts living in this forest. Given the powers of the Evileye Tyrant King, many lives would be killed if they fought on the ground. This was why he brought the fight up to the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The immense pressure that was originally in the sky vanished as the terrifying spiritual windstorm raged. When Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong passed through that windstorm, they finally saw the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was simply gigantic. He was a huge eye with a diameter of more than three hundred meters. There was a total of eighty-one tentacles that poked out from him, each of them around five hundred meters long, and wriggling in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind him, everything was dark red. It was an ocean of soul power. &nbsp;This was why it felt as if the apocalypse was coming when he appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Greetings, Evileye Tyrant. I am Huo Yuhao. I did not come into the Evildemon Forest to disturb your sleep. It’s just that the Holy Ghost Church has been killing human lives. I had to get rid of them. I seek your forgiveness.” Huo Yuhao said calmly to the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had no intention of getting into the bad books of the Evileye Tyrant King. After all, he was one of the strongest creatures on the continent. He controlled the Evildemon Forest. All the soul beasts in the Sun Moon Continent were under his charge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spirit system was already achieving results as time passed. To further advertise it, the help of stronger creatures was needed. If he could convince the Evileye Tyrant King that Spirit Transmission was a possibility, it would be very helpful in promoting more harmonious relations between humans and soul beasts. This was why Huo Yuhao was so polite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King opened his eye wide to look at Huo Yuhao. His voice echoed, “Human, you are very powerful. You are the only human who’s been able to directly challenge my spiritual power. However, you’ve killed humans that have an agreement with us. I can’t just let this matter rest. You must pay the price.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Evileye Tyrant, don’t think that humans are weak just because you’re strong. I don’t wish to become enemies with you. However, this doesn’t mean that I’m afraid of you. We won’t accede to any conditions. We just don’t want to turn hostile with you. If you want to turn hostile, that’s up to you. You can see whether you can take advantage of us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehehehe!” The Evileye Tyrant King suddenly laughed loudly. His eighty-one tentacles kept on dancing in the air. The sky distorted once again. Immense spiritual power surged in the air. The all-engulfing pressure appeared once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was also in admiration of this Evileye Tyrant King. He was able to project his spiritual sea outside of his body and create such powerful spiritual undulations. Huo Yuhao didn’t even think he could do that. Perhaps he might possibly be able to do that once he formed his third soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just like he had said, he wasn’t afraid of the Evileye Tyrant King. His confidence came from his abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Human, it’s been awhile since someone spoke to me like this. Very well, I’d really like to see how strong you are. If you can escape from my hands today, I’ll let this matter rest. Otherwise, you shall remain as compost for this forest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, the Evileye Tyrant King’s eighty-one tentacles turned scarlet-red. They struck toward Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong from all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was indeed very fierce! When he dared to leave his own territory to challenge Di Tian, it was a testament to how impulsive he was. It was impossible that he didn’t sense that Tang Wutong was close to becoming an Ultimate Douluo. However, he still chose to fight them despite that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Huo Yuhao had sworn never to actively kill soul beasts, he wouldn’t show any mercy if he knew that a soul beast wanted his life. Furthermore, he still lacked one soul ring. He lacked the ninth soul ring of his Spirit Eyes. In this world, there was no one more suitable than the Evileye Tyrant King for his ninth soul ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had twin martial souls. If he were an ordinary soul master, he couldn’t possibly absorb the soul ring generated after the Evileye Tyrant King was killed. This was because the energy within it would simply be too much for him to handle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao was different! His cultivation was already very close to that of an Ultimate Douluo. He even had twin soul cores. It was possible for him to absorb the Evileye Tyrant King’s soul ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wore a heavy look on his face when he faced the tentacles. He didn’t directly unleash his domain-type abilities. The Evileye Tyrant King was simply too strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was his first time fighting him, Huo Yuhao had faced Di Tian before. He was well-aware that creatures like the Evileye Tyrant &nbsp;King and the Beast God were at the peak of this world. Not even an ordinary Ultimate Douluo could fight them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King’s control of spatial power was not inferior to the Beast God. This was why he could only prevail by surprise instead of fighting the long way. If the Evileye Tyrant King could even project his spiritual sea out of his body, how dense would his soul power be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fog started to rise from Huo Yuhao’s body. His Morning Dew Dagger was already in his grasp. Tang Wutong was still holding her hammer in her left hand and spear in her right hand, and Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was fully linked to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They weren’t afraid even as they faced the Evileye Tyrant King. They were only excited. Their powers had just increased, but their foundations weren’t very steady yet. Ever since they had reached Rank 95, they hadn’t had a chance to properly consolidate their cultivations. To better comprehend their own cultivations and control the newfound powers they had accumulated, the best way was to fight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just like when Huo Yuhao suggested fighting ten soul masters on his own. It was after that incident that he built his foundation to become a Transcendent Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Evileye Tyrant King was strong, Huo Yuhao was very confident of retreating. Even if he couldn’t win, he could still escape. Since this was the case, he was going to fight heartily. He wanted to use this as an opportunity to increase his live fighting experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Using his Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track, Huo Yuhao shifted with Tang Wiutong. With the help of his Spiritual Detection, it was as if only one of them was using their Instant Teleportation, even though both of them had used it at the same time.</span></p>
