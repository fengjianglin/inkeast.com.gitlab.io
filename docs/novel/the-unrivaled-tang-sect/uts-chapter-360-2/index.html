 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One’s life was very precious. Everyone only had one life! None of them were willing to risk getting killed by the Sunmoon Divine Needle in their bid to assassinate the White Tiger. None of them dared to!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, these twelve assassins immediately turned and fled. To them, their main worry now was finding the fastest way to get at least fifteen kilometers away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke still had a glimmer of hope right now. He had seen Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er leaping off the cliff, too. That was why he didn’t activate the Sunmoon Divine Needle immediately. The strongest weapons were the most terrifying before they were used. Although he didn’t know why his opponents had run, he was relieved to be safe temporarily. Right now, he could only watch and see whether the mysterious man could save his subordinates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke was holding on over on his side, while Huo Yuhao was very busy in the air right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he jumped off the cliff with Wang Dong’er, Wang Dong’er immediately opened up her Butterfly Goddess’ wings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first to jump off the cliff was Zhang Biao. The cliff seemed to be at least three hundred meters high. If a soul master couldn’t fly and didn’t have any way of reducing the speed of his descent, he was bound to die from the fall!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Huo Yuhao dove down rapidly, he unleashed his spiritual power to the best of his abilities. A huge spiritual net quickly engulfed the air around him, and all the White Tiger bodyguards that had leapt off the cliff. In this way, he could tell exactly where each of them was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A streak of deep blue light shot out from Huo Yuhao’s forehead and instantly descended. It was the little Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the little Snow Lady appeared, she waved her hands in the air rapidly. A gust of strong wind rose from the mountain valley. The wind slowed the descent of all the bodyguards, even though they were all decked out in armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress didn’t just control snow. She was the Icesky Snow Lady. In the Extreme North, the extreme chill wasn’t the only scary thing, there was also the wind. This was also one aspect in which the Snow Empress was stronger than the Ice Empress!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from the extreme chill, she also had a deep grasp of the profundity of the wind. For example, the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice included gales.</span></p>

He could only let the little Snow Lady slow their descent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 32pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

In a flash, she was beside Zhang Biao. She used her little hands to gently push Zhang Biao’s back. He was about thirty meters from the ground, but he was now flying towards the side instead of falling as he was pushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Biao was also a soul master. The sudden force that came from his side shocked him. He subconsciously lifted his body in a hurry and tried to control it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a soul master of his rank, thirty meters was a manageable height. As he rolled in the air, he exploited the sudden force that came from his side to reduce the speed of his descent. He also used his palms and soul power to slow his fall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the little Snow Lady pushed Zhang Biao, she lifted her hands once again. Another gust of wind blew upward and slowed the momentum of the bodyguards who were still falling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er finally charged down after the little Snow Lady helped to stall the descent of the bodyguards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the two of them reached their fastest speed. Along with the little Snow Lady, they started flipping and moving about. They caught hold of the bodyguards that were falling from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt very regretful that he didn’t have a soul tool he could use now! His soul tools were mainly very lethal. At this point, there were too many bodyguards falling, even though the area that they covered wasn’t too extensive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao unleashed the Life Reflecting Shield with his right hand and a protective barrier with his body. As he flipped about, he continued to use the Tang Sect’s Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon. However, he still couldn’t catch everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As one person fell, he caught hold of him before instantly pushing him away. He used his right leg to hook onto another person, and also used his Life Reflecting Shield to knock someone else away. He charged forward quickly, and managed to grab hold of more than ten people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he couldn’t possibly catch everyone. He simply had no time! He could only knock them to the sides just as they were about to crash, reducing their speed of descent. They were bound to get hurt, but at least they could still preserve their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were still some bodyguards who couldn’t be saved even though Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er tried their best.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three hundred meters! They had jumped three hundred meters off a cliff, and they were all wearing armor. Their momentum was deadly. Huo Yuhao was only a Soul King, and Wang Dong’er was only a Soul Emperor. Even if they were slightly stronger, they couldn’t possibly save that many people spread out over such a large area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood splattered around them, and life after life was lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao bit his lips tightly. All these soldiers were dead because they were trying to protect the White Tiger Duke!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had jumped off the cliff willingly. Before they jumped off, they had even asked the White Tiger Duke to take care of himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Huo Yuhao’s first time seeing this kind of soldier. It was also his first time experiencing the smell of blood and iron that one could only experience in the military.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bloody smell spread out, and Huo Yuhao was already tearing up. He had done his best. When he grabbed hold of the last bodyguard, he discovered that his arms were already aching. He forcefully rolled on the ground, and his human-shaped soul tool let out a piercing, screeching sound. It took some time before he managed to reduce his falling momentum. However, the inertia still caused him to crash, and he couldn’t help but spit out blood on the inside of his mask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a blurry red in front of his eyes. He felt extremely weak right now.</span></p>

Along with the bloody smell that drifted throughout the entire area, he was feeling very distressed.</span></p>

They were willing to sacrifice their precious lives for their own general! They jumped off the cliff without any hesitation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er didn’t know how many people they had saved. The entire process only took one minute. However, they had drained their soul power and energy. The feeling that they were experiencing now couldn’t be described with words. They had tried their best in this one minute. However, Wang Dong’er couldn’t help but cry when she saw fresh blood splattering from the human figures below her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They…”</span></p>

His spiritual power soared tremendously, but he couldn’t do anything now. What was supposed to happen had already happened. He couldn’t have possibly saved these few precious lives!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, a calm voice sounded in his mind, “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enemies have retreated. The White Tiger Duke is no longer in a crisis. You have passed the Deep Adventure round. Right now, you have two choices.

However, those who have been dead for more than fifteen minutes can’t recover, as their spirits have dissipated. If you choose this option, you must go through the Deep Adventure round once again. You can make your choice now, but you’ll only have ten seconds to decide. After ten seconds, the two of you will automatically be returned to the valley</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">.”</span></p>

The two of them looked at each other, and they each saw the surprise and persistence in the other’s eyes. Wang Dong’er grabbed Huo Yuhao’s hand and the two of them shouted at the same time, “We’ll choose to restore everything back to normal!”</span></p>

A bright golden light that seemed like the sun appeared above Huo Yuhao’s head, while a silver crescent surfaced above Wang Dong’er’s head.</span></p>

Following this, a gold and silver light spread from Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er’s bodies.</span></p>

The bodyguards who were still alive were shocked as they looked at Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er. At this moment, they could roughly make out their appearance.</span></p>

The bodies started to contort slightly. Gradually, their actions became more and more obvious. There were even some who started crawling up.</span></p>

This is a miracle! Are the two of you immortals that have descended to the mortal world?” Zhang Biao crawled up from the ground at this moment. He was also hurt. There were many jagged rocks on the ground, which was also the reason why many of the bodyguards were hurt and killed. However, his injuries had already fully recovered after he was immersed in the gold and silver light.</span></p>
