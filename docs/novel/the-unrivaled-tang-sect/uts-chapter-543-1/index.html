 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The lifespans of aquatic soul beasts are very limited. If we are unable to overcome this limit, we will basically age and die. The prospect of extending our lives even for just a couple of decades would already be incredible! Besides, the thought of being able to experience the humans’ world was equally enticing. Hence, we became really interested in his idea. Afterwards, those humans released a spirit for us to see. It was indeed very mystical to lose one’s body, but not one’s soul. It was also my first time witnessing something so special!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After thinking about it, I decided to try and collaborate with them. Those people told me how there were many humans who were hoping to get some spirits. However, the soul beast would have to undergo some ceremonies, which must be conducted on land. Those ceremonies needed some formations, and those formations could not be placed in the middle of the sea. I was too foolish back then, and believed them without any hesitation. I gathered some of the merfolk who were on the brink of death and sent them to the shore. I sent over a thousand merfolk to the shore without knowing that that would be the last time I would see them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After a month passed, I sent a few merfolk to check with the humans. I wanted to know if the spirit ceremonies had been performed successfully. Those humans told us how the merfolk I had sent over had all successfully become spirits. In addition, they told me that they realized how aquatic beasts were more suitable to become spirits than normal soul beasts. The stronger aquatic soul beasts were even able to split just a sliver of their soul to become spirits. The remaining soul could still stay within its main body. After the main body died, the part of the soul which was in the human’s body could continue being a spirit. It was as if it had gained an extra life. This would also allow the human which had this special spirit to live longer, or even live as long as us aquatic soul beasts. They convinced us that it would be a win-win situation if we were to hand them some of our stronger aquatic soul beasts for experimentation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing what the Princess of the Sea had said, Tang Wutong felt a chill run down her spine. She had never expected someone to use the Spirits that Huo Yuhao had researched for their own evil agenda. On top of that, they had brought trouble to the entire Merfolk race. Without asking the Princess, she already knew who these humans were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess’ eyes were full of hatred as she lamented, “I was so foolish. I couldn’t see through their ploy, and actually agreed to their arrangements. In addition, I ordered my daughter to bring my people to the shore to assist them with their experimentation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those despicable humans didn’t know that Merfolk royalty are able to sense each other spiritually. In addition, we can actually communicate with one other over long distances through spiritual means. A few days later, my little daughter passed a message to me and told me how we had been duped by the humans. Those despicable humans lied about their ability to transfer spirits. Our first batch of merfolk had all been tricked by the humans to release their spirits before they were all made into avenging spirits. This time around, they had even planned to use the stronger members of our race to make soul beast puppets. They were really cruel and ruthless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even though I was shocked, I quickly assembled my people to rescue my little daughter. However, those despicable humans were ready for us. Our rescue was not only unsuccessful, but we also lost countless merfolk in the battle. After all, once we leave the seawater, our powers decrease drastically. In the end, I barely managed to rescue my little daughter. Even then, she had already been tortured until she was at her limit. “</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she stopped here, the Princess of the Sea and the mermaid with the silver crown were already tearing up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Snow Empress, tell me, how am I supposed to not hate those despicable humans? Afterwards, I regrouped my people, and we launched countless attacks on them. However, they were always able to repel our attacks with their strange weapons. Now, I have already given the order to kill any human who dares to enter the Ice Sea!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke till here, the Princess no longer tried to conceal her murderous intent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress frowned immediately.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I can’t believe this… Now I know why the Princess of the Sea—who was usually very gentle and kind—has become so hateful. She had actually been through so many unfortunate events. It must have pained her to see her own people die, and how her own daughter almost lost her life. What could be worse than watching one’s own people transform into avenging spirits, never to be reborn? Her hatred for humans is very understandable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong exclaimed, “Your Highness, all of you have been duped. Those people aren’t even the creator of Spirits. Yuhao is the one who created them.” As she spoke, she pointed at, Huo Yuhao who was standing beside her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea laughed coldly and said, “So are you now going to ask me if I want to collaborate with you? Do you really think I will still believe you despicable humans and your stupid Spirits project? I will never agree to your requests again—even if you get the Snow Empress to ask on your behalf.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress sighed and said, “Princess of the Sea, this entire thing is a misunderstanding. Those humans who had cheated all of you are scum among the human soul masters. They are called evil soul masters. There is an organization within the Sun Moon Empire which is called the Holy Ghost Church. It consists of only evil soul masters, who employ all sorts of devilish methods to strengthen their abilities. The fellows who had transformed your people into avenging spirits have just been killed by these two humans. I can also vouch for the fact that Yuhao is the real researcher who came up with Spirits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea was doubtful of the Snow Empress’ words. “How can you prove that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress replied plainly, “Because I am the first soul beast in the entire continent which was successfully transformed into a Spirit. I am Huo Yuhao’s Spirit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Both the Princess of the Sea and her daughter exclaimed in disbelief. They could not fathom why a powerful soul beast like the Snow Empress would actually submit to become a human’s Spirit. On top of that, they did not understand why the Snow Empress was trying to persuade them for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yo-You…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress stared at the startled Princess of the Sea as she sighed. Following which, she shared how she was captured by human soul masters when she was trying to rebuild herself and transform into a foetus. She then went on to explain how she bumped into Huo Yuhao, and became his Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as she explained, the Snow Empress became increasingly uncertain of convincing the two mermaids. She realized how their eyes became increasingly aloof. It was apparent that they did not really believe what she was saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Spirits system that Yuhao has developed is extremely beneficial. It can drastically reduce the number of killings between humans and soul beasts. At the same time, it can also reduce the conflict and animosity between humans and soul beasts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Enough!” The Princess of the Sea suddenly interrupted the Snow Empress. “Stop talking. Your glib tongue will not be enough to dupe me again. You can’t be the Snow Empress. With the power that she has, how could she become a human’s Spirit? I don’t know how you humans managed to replicate her image, and even her powers. But all of you are going to die today. My little daughter is about to die, and today, all of you will join her, and keep her company on her last journey.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, the Princess of the Sea released a loud battle cry as she pushed her hands forward. The seawater immediately surged upwards before transforming into countless waves which rolled towards the Snow Empress, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress stared coldly at the incoming waves. She knew that it was no longer possible to reach a peaceful resolution. As she let out a sigh, she quickly returned to Huo Yuhao’s body and regained control over his body from the Ice Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dark blue light instantly expanded from Huo Yuhao’s body into his surroundings. This time round, it was no longer the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, but pure Ultimate Ice soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An unexpected scene unfolded before everyone’s eyes. Those humongous waves suddenly froze when they about a couple of dozen meters from Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. They had transformed into thick blocks of ice in mid-air before dropping back down into the sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those were humongous ice blocks! Hence, they released a deafening sound when they landed in the water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This unexpected power was due to the boost provided by the Icy War God's Armor. Under the influence of the Divine Ice Crystals and the Ice Spirits within them, the armor was able to absorb ice-type elemental energy from the air and replenish the energy within the armor on its own. At the same time, it had an amplifying ability which amplified Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice soul power by at least three times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because it possessed an internal regenerative ability and external amplification ability, calling it the armor of the generation would not be an overstatement. On top of these, it possessed incredible offensive and defensive capabilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the gigantic ice blocks landed in the sea, the Snow Empress controlled Huo Yuhao’s hand as she made him clench his fist. Instantly, a second loud sound could be heard. The ice blocks exploded under Huo Yuhao's control as shockwaves spread out far across the sea. All sorts of floating ice structures were immediately destroyed by the ice shards and the shockwaves. Their destruction guaranteed the destruction of their neighboring ice blocks as a chain reaction formed on the ocean’s surface.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ice Explosion!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time around, Huo Yuhao was not the one who executed the Ice Explosion. This was because the person who was controlling Huo Yuhao when he clenched his fist was the Ice Empress!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ice Explosion was an extremely powerful ability which belonged to the Ice Jade Scorpions. Previously, when the Ice Empress chose to become Huo Yuhao’s second martial soul on top of becoming his soul ring, she was unable to hand this soul skill over to him. However, when it came to controlling the Ice Explosion skill, the Ice Empress was definitely better than the Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, she not only detonated the blocks of ice that fell from the sky, but also the icebergs within a few thousand meter radius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That insane explosive power instantly caused the entire expansive Ice Sea to become extremely chaotic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among Huo Yuhao’s five most powerful Spirits, the Ice Empress had the worst temper. The Ice Empress was infuriated after watching how the Princess of the Sea was so demanding and unreasonable even after the Snow Empress had tried to personally convince her otherwise. She could not bear to see how the Princess of the Sea threatened to kill Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. Hence, the Ice Empress chose to detonate the icebergs around them. This sent the entire sea into a frenzy, which the Princess of the Sea could not turn a blind eye to. Even though both herself and her daughter would not be in trouble, the countless aquatic soul beasts in the sea would be in serious peril.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea had no choice but to focus fully on controlling the seawater to counter the powerful explosion started by Ice Explosion. She had to contain the explosion in order to prevent it from affecting the underwater world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress hesitated for a short while before signalling Tang Wutong. Together, they flew away into the distance.</span></p>
