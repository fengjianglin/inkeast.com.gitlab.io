 <p><strong>Book 3: Fusion of Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 17.1: First Time Cooperating; Two People Control the Battlefield</strong></p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was somewhat speechless as he said, “Arrogance causes setbacks; at least be a bit more low-profile.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong snorted. “Do you think that I can actually have a low-profile with my martial soul?”</p>
 <p>“Uh…” Right! Wang Dong’s Radiant Butterfly Goddess was an existence that would always stun everyone whenever it appeared. For him to have a low-profile wouldn’t be easy.</p>
 <p>A wordless night passed as the two cultivated in silence. The next morning, the two walked over to their school building after eating breakfast. When they entered class, they felt a fervent atmosphere envelop them.</p>
 <p>Everyone had gathered in their respective groups of three, and were whispering to one another.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao had arrived before the two of them, and thus was already waiting for them. When she saw them enter the classroom, she hurriedly waved towards them.</p>
 <p>When Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had reacher her, Xiao Xiao said, “The assessment is going to formally begin this afternoon. Let’s discuss some tactics.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong unperturbedly said, “There’s nothing for us to discuss. Let’s just go and fight.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao softly shook her head and said, “It’s not that easy. I’ve heard that every single class has a few especially outstanding students who’ve in turn formed elite teams that are gunning for the champion spot. They won’t be easy to deal with. We have to be well-coordinated to have a chance against them.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong still wanted to retort, but was cut off by Huo Yuhao. “Wang Dong, act properly. If you don’t, I’ll have to ask Teacher Zhou to change our teams.”</p>
 <p>It wasn’t clear whether or not Xiao Xiao still held a grudge against Wang Dong rejecting her yesterday, but she immediately echoed Huo Yuhao, “That’s right! Too much over-confidence is simply arrogance.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong humphed, but no longer spoke.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao put his hand on Wang Dong’s shoulder and said, “Alright, don’t be angry. If we work together, won’t it be even easier for us to defeat our enemies during the assessment? Let’s discuss the abilities that we specialise in.”</p>
 <p>Even though they’d been classmates for three months, they’d still only studied together. Cultivation was something that they’d done individually, thus nobody really knew much about anyone else’s martial souls.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao continued, “I’ll start first. I have a spiritual-type martial soul. I can use a skill known as Spiritual Detection Sharing, which can let you detect any movements within a fifty metre diameter in a fairly detailed manner. At the same time, it can also predict an opponent’s movements to a certain extent.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong said, “I’m an assault system soul master. Short-range and long-range attacks are both okay for me. I’m also able to fly.” Although he was somewhat arrogant, he truly had the qualifications to act as such. Regardless of whether it was his cultivation, his martial soul, or his soul skills, he was an outstanding existence among his peers. The simple fact that his second soul ring was a thousand year one was something that perhaps no one else in the academy could outshine.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao nodded and said, “My main martial soul is the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron. It can both attack and defend, and can control the battlefield to a certain extent. It can also intimidate my enemies by ramming into them, which will cause them to feel dizzy, while getting hurt at the same time. My second martial soul is a flute—the Nine Phoenix Flute. It focuses on auxiliary and control-type abilities. Currently, my second martial soul only has a hundred year soul ring. It can slow down the speed of our enemies during combat.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was slightly amazed as he asked, “Your auxiliary-type martial soul doesn’t boost yourself?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao had a proud smile on her face as she replied, “Nope. Sometimes, weakening an enemy is better than boosting one’s self. When the time comes, you’ll see what I mean. However, it isn’t that easy for me to use my second martial soul, so it’s better if we hide a bit of our strength and take it slow.”</p>
 <p>Both Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong suddenly realized something—Xiao Xiao might be even stronger than they thought.</p>
 <p>What they didn’t know was that, when Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao worked together to control the battlefield, they would explode out with a frightening amount of control.</p>
 <p>“Thump, thump, thump.” Three rapping sounds rang out. When the class heard that, it immediately became so quiet you could hear a pin drop.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi stood at the entrance to the classroom, her right hand just coming back down to her side. The rapping sound had been from her rapping on the door to the classroom.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi still maintained her ice-cold composure as she slowly walked up to the platform. “I’ve already reported the list of teams that are partaking in the competition later. The competition will formally start this afternoon. It will use a round-robin system, and you won’t meet each other during the ten matches that you’ll be competing in, only teams from other classes. I only have one line of advice for you: If anyone tries to stop you from passing the assessment, beat the shit out of them. That’s it, you can all disperse. We’ll gather at the assessment area this afternoon.” When Zhou Yi had finished speaking, she hard-headedly turned around and walked away.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong spoke in a low voice to Huo Yuhao. “Don’t you think that old lady Zhou is becoming cooler and cooler?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao glanced at him and said, “This isn’t being cool; she’s being completely domineering.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao walked over and giggled. “Teacher Zhou’s just giving off a strong presence. Let’s go and find a place to train together for a while. If we don’t, how will we coordinate later?’</p>
 <p>Without waiting for Wang Dong to speak, Huo Yuhao immediately nodded his head in agreement. “Student Wang Dong, if you ever want to eat roasted fish next time, I have to request that you to listen to every command of the current class monitor during the freshman assessment. Do you agree to these terms?”</p>
 <p>“Urgh…” Wang Dong looked at Huo Yuhao’s resolute gaze, then said with an indignant expression on his face, “Huo Yuhao, you’re really taking advantage of my fear.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao calmly replied, “You can choose not to eat them.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong hesitated for a moment, but still relented in the end. “I surrender. I’ll listen to you. However, you’re in charge of the hygiene in the dorm room from now on.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had a look of disdain on his face as he said, “Have you cleaned the room at all during these past three months?”</p>
 <p>“This…” Wang Dong felt speechless as he said, “You’re a fierce one, aren’t you?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao seemed to be standing completely on Huo Yuhao’s side as she giggled. “Laziness is a type of sin.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong suddenly blurted out a few words, causing the young Xiao Xiao to immediately blush. “Xiao Xiao, the target of your affection really changes fast!”</p>
 <p>“You—!” Xiao Xiao pointed her finger at Wang Dong with a look of anger on her face. She even looked as if she had been wronged.</p>
 <p>“Okay, okay. Didn’t we say that we were going to train? Let’s hurry up and do so. I think that we should head outside the academy. There are tons of trees outside the academy, thus we won’t be easily disturbed by the others.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong stuck his tongue out at Xiao Xiao, then turned around to leave. Only after Huo Yuhao had given Xiao Xiao a few words of consolation, did she become happy. Afterwards, the two chased after Wang Dong, following the lakeside path as they left the academy.</p>
 <p>Looking for a quiet place outside Shrek Academy couldn’t be any easier for them. Although there were several roads, there was a large amount of vegetation that covered both sides of the main road. Some of it was naturally grown, while some of it had been planted by hand.</p>
 <p>After the three had found a relatively flat area in the forest, Wang Dong asked, “How’re we going to train? Are we just going to use our soul skills once?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao immediately refuted him, “How would that be useful? You naturally need to have a fight for training to be the most effective. You’re an assault system soul master, so you can be on one side, while the class monitor and I will be on the other side. Let’s have a match.”</p>
 <p>“You two against me?” Wang Dong raised his right hand, wagging his forefinger as he said, “That won’t do. With just the two of you, you won’t have a chance against me!”</p>
