 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

More importantly, she had the experience of participating in the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament, in addition to the consolidation during her previous closed-door cultivation. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing was also supporting her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had already begun to retreat the moment the Deviltiger Cat pounced forward. She was a Tang Sect disciple, and she knew how to use the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track. She constantly changed directions as she flew backwards swiftly while the Spiritual Detection determined the light blade’s position the moment it was unleashed. Her body arched like a bow as she flew backwards and narrowly evaded the light blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A series of crackling sounds could be heard wherever the light blade crossed, and a great many plants met their ends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao broke out into a cold sweat even though she managed to dodge this attack. Fortunately, she wasn’t the Deviltiger Cat’s target, as she wouldn’t have avoided its attack so easily otherwise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat had arrived before Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Purplish-golden radiance flickered once more as brilliant light flames poured out from Huo Yuhao’s eyes. The Deviltiger Cat’s blood-red pupils also sparkled once following this shining outburst. It was apparent that it was aware of Huo Yuhao’s formidable spiritual-type abilities from its child, and it wanted to use its own spiritual power to fight against Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat soon realized its mistake, as Huo Yuhao’s target of choice was something else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thousand year Deviltiger Cat that was lying prostrate on the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat’s back was overflowing with murderous hostility, and lying eagerly in wait. “Tch –” Its hide suddenly crackled like a melon being smashed open, and blood instantly poured out from the seven apertures of its head. The blood trickled down and flowed all over the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t show a single ounce of mercy this time. The thousand year Deviltiger Cat had already taken a hit from his Spiritual Shock before this, and its spiritual sea was already severely damaged. It had no preparation at all, and when took another all-out strike from Huo Yuhao, its brain directly turned to mush.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the law of the jungle – if my enemy wants to kill me, I have to kill my enemy first. There was only cold light in Huo Yuhao’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It hadn’t been long since they had faced the thousand year Deviltiger Cat, and then the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat caught up with them shortly afterwards. However, his opinions had transformed drastically, because he realized that the peril they were mired in was because of their tenderheartedness. Those that weren’t of the same species surely thought differently, and these were soul beasts, after all. This was an unchangeable fact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat was shocked by the thousand year Deviltiger Cat’s death. It roared into the sky as it subconsciously turned back towards the thousand year Deviltiger Cat on its back. It had ultimately been alive for ten thousand years, and its innate ability allowed it to turn its body in midair at a time like this as it temporarily avoided Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, both Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong made a move at this moment. Vigorous blue, purple and golden light sparkled on their bodies – The Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were guided by the Spiritual Detection Sharing, and the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat was also momentarily disoriented. This attack was aimed at a location that the Deviltiger Cat was bound to cross.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The brilliant Golden Road lit up a few hundred meters around them, and slammed directly against the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat, which was immediately transformed into a golden sculpture, and plummeted downwards with its forward momentum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time they had used the Golden Road used against a soul beast, and its effects startled both Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cat’s shadow seemed to depart from the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat’s body as it crashed against the ground, motionless. The shadow quickly lunged towards the body on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is…” Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong exchanged a look, and they both felt a little dumbfounded. This shadow surged into the Deviltiger Cat’s body within these two seconds, and the golden color on its body swiftly receded before it leapt to its feet once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat seemed a little wretched at this point. The Golden Road carried immense light power, and many charcoal-black spots had appeared all over its fur from the corruption, while its powerful aura was also greatly diminished. It tossed its head from side to side, as if it were struggling against something. The thousand year Deviltiger Cat dropped to the ground by its side, and a purple thousand year soul ring gradually took form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was apparent that the Golden Road had a different effect on soul beasts than on soul masters. Huo Yuhao had chosen this martial soul fusion skill because of the Golden Road’s ability to control his opponent. However, the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat exceeded his expectations in the end. It was moving too fast, and it flew out far away with its forward momentum despite taking a direct hit from the Golden Road. It was too far out of range for Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong to chain their onslaught, while what happened afterwards bewildered them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat was just vigorously shaking its head. It only recovered after a few seconds, and it immediately glanced towards the thousand year Deviltiger Cat’s corpse beside it. It roared furiously into the sky, and its blood-red eyes felt as if they were actually dripping with blood while it pounced towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong once more. However, its speed was clearly a little slower than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute chimed continuously as it worked its slowing effect on the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat. Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong couldn’t be bothered about what exactly had happened with the changes that had just occurred to this soul beast, as they had to focus all their attention on this air of hostility that was charging towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Deviltiger Cat’s fur suddenly turned emerald-green, and a green radiance immediately expanded outwards. This expansion wasn’t forceful, and only reached about a foot from it, but it appeared as if the Deviltiger Cat’s entire body was also expanding. It was initially a little more than a meter long, but as its entire sparkled with green light, it grew to the point where it was now more than two meters long. It also looked burlier than before, as if it were an actual fearsome tiger. Even the purring sounds from its mouth became more like a tiger’s roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The immense pressure made Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong feel a little suffocated, and the enormous gap in their cultivations was apparent at this moment. This Deviltiger Cat was similar in power to a Soul King after all, and its abilities were possibly also superior to those of a Soul King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had retreated quickly while the Deviltiger Cat was vigorously tossing its head from side to side. Circle after circle of golden light emanated from Wang Dong’s left arm, and both of them appeared to sparkle with golden luster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Haodong power amplified the Golden Light Left Arm Bone’s soul skill, Golden Light, as the soul skill swiftly took effect, and the soul power they had consumed to power their martial soul fusion skill was restored with dazzling speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao raised his left hand and fired a beam of light at the Deviltiger Cat that was lunging towards him. He was pretty much locked onto his target with the Spiritual Detection Sharing, and this beam was the soul paralysis ray.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul paralysis ray’s light accurately landed on the Deviltiger Cat’s body, or it could be said that the Deviltiger Cat willingly collided against this beam. The dense green light around its body flickered, and the soul paralysis ray was actually diverted away from the green light that was protecting its body. The emerald-green hues burst violently, and the Deviltiger Cat’s speed exploded once more as it arrived before Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong in a flash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sphere of light that was a foot in diameter rose into the sky. Huo Yuhao shifted behind Wang Dong and grabbed onto Wang Dong’s shoulders with both hands as they used the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track at the same time. They moved with blinding speed as the Deviltiger Cat smashed against that sphere of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Uncountable rays of light surged in an instant, completely enveloping the Deviltiger Cat’s body within them. However, the Deviltiger Cat had unleashed its origin skill, and it was truly fearsome. The golden rays of light seemed to dissipate immediately as they rushed into the layer of emerald-green radiance that was protecting its body. The Deviltiger Cat’s body had been impeded in midair, and it couldn’t continue its assault, but this moment only lasted about the time needed for two breaths. The rays of light were all dispelled, but the protective radiance on the Deviltiger Cat’s body appeared to have thinned a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Deviltiger Cat’s soul skill was similar to Dai Yueheng’s White Tiger’s Shield, except this was just its first soul skill, and it boosted its attack, defense and speed. Wang Dong’s Butterfly Goddess Slash was formidable, but he couldn’t gain an advantage at all against the Deviltiger Cat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong changed their tactics once more with this moment’s worth of hindrance to the Deviltiger Cat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was still standing behind Wang Dong as he channeled Haodong power into Wang dong’s body. Wang Dong raised his right arm and pointed his index finger at the Deviltiger Cat, while his entire right arm began to glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was different from the circles displayed by his left arm’s Golden Light. The radiance from his right arm was a concentration of sharp energies.</span></p>

Two powerful soul bone skills were activated at the same time, and they boosted one another.</span></p>

The attack that he was unleashing at this moment was his most powerful strike.</span></p>

This beam was about three inches long, and its tip was pointed, while its root was thick like a finger. The Golden Light’s hues were sparkling with lightning speed.</span></p>

Wang Dong named it the Broken Devil of Light because he was lazy, and it instantly concentrated the power of light into a single point and launched an attack. It looked like a drill because Wang Dong’s cultivation wasn’t high enough, but it could become as thin as a needle as he became stronger, to the point where it would eventually become a thread of light.</span></p>

His light power was extremely effective against the dark-type ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat.</span></p>
