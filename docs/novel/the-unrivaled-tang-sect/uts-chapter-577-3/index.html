<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, a two ringed evil soul master would definitely be able to slaughter a huge number of normal two ringed soul masters with his or her own evil soul skills. However, the gap would be a lot smaller when a five ringed evil soul master fought against a five ringed soul master. Eventually, after both types of soul masters had reached Titled Douluo, evil soul masters would be more or less the same as normal soul masters, except for some advantages which were near negligible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu had ranked him alongside his other Transcendent Douluo after Huo Yuhao had demonstrated the courage to fight ten different people. Even if Huo Yuhao was super arrogant, he would never have proposed such a ludicrous challenge if he did not even possess the abilities of a Transcendent Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Zhongli Wu only planned to send the Transcendent Douluo under him to fight Huo Yuhao. Sending any Titled Douluo would just be a waste of his precious resources. After all, it was very difficult to train an evil soul master to become a Titled Douluo! Those dead Titled Douluo could have been war machines on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, the second person Huo Yuhao was about to fight was Feng Ling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling was the second strongest evil soul master among those who had followed Zhongli Wu to the battlefield. She was right behind him in the pecking order. &nbsp;The fact that Zhongli Wu had decided to send her as the second person meant that he did not want to lose any more of his powerful evil soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling floated to a position which was about a hundred meters away from Huo Yuhao before landing on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was also robed in black, even though she was not covering her head with a hood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was undoubtedly beautiful, even though she was already a middle-aged woman. Her skin was still extremely fair, and she radiated a devilish, seductive aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not the first time Huo Yuhao had seen the Vice-Leader of the Holy Ghost Church. Previously when he first met Feng Ling, he could still remember clearly how pressuring it was to even be in her presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time when they finally met again, she had become his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling had a strange pair of eyes. Even though they were not particularly huge, they were alluring in a very different way. There were two dark red streaks which extended from the corners of her eyes to her temples. These streaks on her face gave her a very devilish look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Yuhao.” Feng Ling spoke coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao revealed a faint smile and said, “Hello, Vice-Leader. We meet again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling replied coldly, “You are Tang Wu, the person who participated in the Radiant City Elite Soul Engineering Tournament, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and answered, “That’s right! It seems like the Vice-Leader is very observant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Very well.” Feng Ling’s voice was becoming colder as the black robe on her body started to flutter, even though there was no wind at all. Suddenly a piercing phoenix roar could be heard from her body as her soul rings started to rise around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three purple, five black, and one red ring!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her soul ring combination far exceeded the optimal soul ring combination. Her soul rings were radiating a brilliant glow onto their surroundings. She did not have a single hundred-year soul ring. Even her lousiest soul ring was a thousand-year soul ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Huo Yuhao was a little startled after seeing her nine soul rings appear before his eyes. He was amazed at the power she had demonstrated.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder she’s the Vice-Leader of the Holy Ghost Church.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao did not know exactly what rank Feng Ling was at. However, he could roughly tell from her aura that she should be somewhere around Rank 96. Because of the fact that she was an evil soul master, she could even be Rank 97. This Vice-Leader would definitely pose a bigger challenge than Wu Yun. On top of that, Feng Ling was now using a spiritual defensive soul tool. She would be a lot more resistant to Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes’ soul skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s face revealed a faint glow as his Icy War God’s Armor gave off a mystical glow under his control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the purple soul ring on Feng Ling’s body started to emit a bright light. At the very next instant, a pair of dark purple wings extended behind her back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A powerful aura was instantly released as it swarmed and surged towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Phoenix wings? What kind of phoenix is this? Why are its wings purple?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had previously seen Feng Ling in action. However, back then, Feng Ling did not go all-out. This time, the Vice-Leader of the Holy Ghost Church was undoubtedly going to use all of her powers to take him down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were no flames at all despite the immense pressure the wings were radiating.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That is…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Darkness? Darkness Phoenix?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, that would be wrong. It can’t be the Darkness Phoenix. The Darkness Phoenix’s aura should be pure, and would definitely not be so cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This must be the Evil Phoenix!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, this was Feng Ling’s martial soul—the Evil Phoenix. This matched exactly with her title, which was the Evil Phoenix Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evil Phoenix Douluo, Feng Ling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Intense soul power fluctuations were radiating from the gigantic Evil Phoenix wings as the surrounding light started to become dimmer. It seemed as though the entire sky had turned grey. A powerful, suffocating sensation made Huo Yuhao find it hard to breathe, even though he was within his Icy War God’s Armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling is really powerful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe, who was watching from the distance along with the other powerful individuals from the Shrek Academy, was startled as he muttered, “Evil Phoenix? So she’s actually the Evil Phoenix Douluo… I can’t believe Feng Ling is the person who is holding that title. It seems like she has also joined the Holy Ghost Church.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing what he was muttering, two people looked over at him with unfriendly eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of them was naturally Cai Mei’er—Yan Shaozhe’s wife and the Vice-Dean of the Martial Soul Department. The other person was none other than Xian Lin’er—the Valkyrie Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe forced a cough as he quickly regained his composure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course he knew who Feng Ling was. To be even more precise, he had once shared an ill-fated relationship with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, when Yan Shaozhe had just completed his training, he had been the most talented individual in the new batch of students from Shrek Academy. He was not only the disciple of the Dragon God Douluo, but was also extremely powerful and handsome. Coupled with his powerful martial soul—the Radiant Phoenix—he was blessed with every single thing which could make him successful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Yan Shaozhe tended to be a little flirtatious when it came to relationships. Otherwise, he would not have developed a poor relationship with the Valkyrie Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His relationship with Feng Ling had happened before he had even gotten together with Xian Lin’er. Back then, when he had just completed his training, he had bumped into Feng Ling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them had phoenixes as their martial souls. Back then, Feng Ling was a lot weaker, and the evil within her phoenix martial soul had yet to be awakened. Hence, it seemed a lot more like the Darkness Phoenix, especially when it was easy to mistake the evilness as dark-type energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Radiant Phoenix had just met the Darkness Phoenix, Yan Shaozhe did not ostracize her. He felt that he did not have to do so because his very own teacher—Mu En—was also very good friends with Long Xiaoyao. In fact, the Radiant Holy Dragon and Darkness Holy Dragon even became a very inspirational tale for everyone in the Douluo Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, instead of finding Feng Ling repulsive, he was very interested in her. After all, he might just be able to start another inspirational tale with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe was young, handsome, powerful, and extremely charismatic. Before long, both of them got together, and became a lot closer very quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, their blissful days did not last very long. After being together for about three months or so, Feng Ling’s evil aura was suddenly awakened one day. In fact, if Yan Shaozhe were to only find out about it later, he would have been killed and consumed by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a special kind of connection the Evil Phoenix had with the Radiant Phoenix. To be more precise, Feng Ling’s Evil Phoenix was only able to awaken so quickly after Yan Shaozhe had developed an intimate relationship with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, a huge battle broke out between Yan Shaozhe and Feng Ling. Yan Shaozhe was able to suppress Feng Ling with his superior powers. However, he could not bear to kill her. After all, he had already developed very powerful feelings for her. Feng Ling was the first woman in his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, he could not help but let Feng Ling flee. Afterward, he also left. From that day onwards, he had never seen Feng Ling again. Even though he managed to catch hold of news about her attaining the Titled Douluo rank, he had no idea where she was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu En had, in fact, reprimanded him severely because of this incident. The Evil Phoenix was one of the most gifted martial souls among the possible martial souls which evil soul masters could possess. This meant that Yan Shaozhe had let a powerful monster loose! No one would know how many people would have to suffer under her wrath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, Mu En had made the exact mistake, and naturally did not want to see his disciple repeat the same mistake. In fact, he was more worried that Yan Shaozhe would fall too deeply in love with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Yan Shaozhe was grounded for three years as he studied and trained hard within Shrek Academy. It was the three years of closed-door cultivation which helped him develop the ability to eventually become the Dean of the Martial Soul Department.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After so many years, Yan Shaozhe finally saw Feng Ling again. The thoughts and feelings which were racing through his body and mind could only be understood by him alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Feng Ling seemed to have completely forgotten about him. She did not even try to steal a glance at him as she kept her gaze focused on Huo Yuhao. The powerful Evil Phoenix aura exploded like a geyser as it radiated from her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Feng Ling were now facing one another, but neither of them took the initiative to start the attack. Huo Yuhao’s aura was well concealed, whereas Feng Ling released her aura flamboyantly. Her aura caused the weather within a thousand-meter radius to become extremely volatile. Even the powerful soul masters from both sides who were spectating had no choice but to release their soul power to defend themselves from her aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!” Feng Ling let out a cold grunt as her figure flickered. A series of strange-looking figures were left behind her as she sped forward. The shape of the figures resembled a purple phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling’s right hand suddenly became incredibly huge as it transformed into a gigantic purple claw as she raced towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a simple, direct attack. She did not use her martial soul true body. It was almost as though she did not learn from Wu Yun’s lesson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao neither retreated nor tried to evade her attack. Instead, he dug his toes into the ground before launching himself forward in a ferocious manner. Similarly, he raised his right hand and waved it furiously. A gigantic dark golden claw which spanned a hundred meters immediately enveloped Feng Ling’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Darkgolden Terrorclaw!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing the intense glow and the incredibly sharp aura of the Darkgolden Terrorclaw which threatened to tear anything in its way apart, even Zhongli Wu was startled. He had never imagined Huo Yuhao to be so powerful. The Darkgolden Terrorclaw Huo Yuhao had released was already on par with that of a hundred thousand year Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear .</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling released a cold grunt as the wings behind her folded together before she extended her right phoenix claw to grab Huo Yuhao’s Darkgolden Terrorclaw. She was trying to use her small claw against Huo Yuhao’s humongous claw!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cling!” A bright sound echoed in the air as a series of soul power explosions occurred at the point of contact. The loud explosive sounds traveled through the surrounding air and into the ears of the surrounding spectators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The series of explosions released countless sharp auras which cut deep into the earth around them, resulting in humongous trenches around them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The troops from the Sun Moon Empire and the people from Shrek Academy had no choice but to activate their strongest defensive measures to protect themselves from the invincibly sharp fluctuations which radiated from Huo Yuhao and Feng Ling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao remained stationary in the air, while Feng Ling had been forced backward by close to forty meters. Her black long robe had been torn to pieces by the sharp aura, revealing the light armor built from black scales she was wearing under it.</span></p>
