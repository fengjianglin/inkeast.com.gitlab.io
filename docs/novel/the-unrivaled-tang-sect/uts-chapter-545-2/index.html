 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea said, “We Mermaids are known for our spiritual power. Each of us has the opportunity to offer a blessing once in our lives. The person that’s blessed by us will be fortunate, and he’ll forever be seen as a friend to Merfolk. If it’s someone from our species, it’s a show of love. This person has actually received a Mermaid’s Blessing. In addition, it’s from my pitiful daughter! How, how is this possible? What has happened?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong suddenly recalled what had happened during that fight. She was astonished as she said, “I think I know what’s going on. Before we came here, we teamed up to kill the evil soul master who harmed your daughter. Among the avenging spirits that belonged to him, one had the appearance of a mermaid. Yuhao used his power of purification to cleanse her. Before that mermaid avenging spirit disappeared, it released a spot of white light that landed on Yuhao’s body. Is that likely to be the Mermaid’s Blessing that you’re talking about?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea teared up once again. This time, her tears weren’t golden. They appeared as clear-white pearls. They were tears of bliss and guilt. She felt guilty for how she had targeted Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong in the past, and blissful because her daughter was able to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid seemed to recognize Huo Yuhao after the fusion was granted a Mermaid’s Blessing. She no longer appeared fearful anymore. There was only a look of kinship and gratitude in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The incantations and the contract continued. Without any resistance, everything was successful</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Golden flowing light surrounded Huo Yuhao and the mermaid. Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea contained five powerful Spirits as of now. In fact, it was already at its bottleneck previously. However, it was further enriched by the golden pearls. Furthermore, with the Princess of the Sea’s golden pearls, his spiritual sea was extremely compatible with this mermaid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As their spiritual powers interacted, Huo Yuhao didn’t feel as if his spiritual power had reached a bottleneck. On the contrary, the cracks that had formed in his spiritual sea earlier quickly healed, and his spiritual sea was even expanding at a rapid speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was absolutely a delightful surprise. Was this the effect of a spiritual-type Spirit?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before this, Huo Yuhao didn’t have a pure spiritual-type Spirit. This mermaid was his first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the fusion process, the mermaid could also sense the memories that Huo Yuhao let go of. Her expression turned gentler and gentler. Her lower body gradually turned pure gold after she lost her soul. After this, her body started to turn into light before transforming into spots of golden light that drifted up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid didn’t absorb these spots of golden light. When Huo Yuhao finally finished reciting his incantations, her body had already turned completely golden. She moved her tail slightly before landing on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bubbles that were originally around Huo Yuhao were crushed. However, Huo Yuhao didn’t feel suffocated at all. It was as if air had surged into his pores from all directions. In addition, he could clearly feel his spiritual power growing very quickly. It didn’t seem that there was an upper limit either. His spiritual soul core expanded. The dim gold of the golden pearls earlier turned bright gold now. His entire spiritual sea grew by more than a third. In his spiritual sea, the seawater was no longer viscous, but completely solid. The color of the seawater was also much deeper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His immense spiritual power spread, and even left the surface of the sea. He could sense everything around the sea and the entire underwater palace by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid finally saw her mother and elder sister. There was a sorrowful look in her eyes, but there was also a look of delight now that she had gotten a new life. Right now, she wasn’t stable as a Spirit yet. This was why she still couldn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She gently moved her tail, and the golden lights that were formed from her body drifted out before landing on her elder sister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, her crown turned from silver to gold, and her silver tail also turned golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the strength of her lineage! The mermaid who had just become Huo Yuhao’s Spirit fused the strength of her lineage and passed it on to her elder sister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She passed the golden Merfolk lineage of to her elder sister, so that her elder sister could continue to pass it down and become the next Princess of the Sea. This was the last thing that she had left in the sea. From now on, she was no longer part of the Merfolk, but Huo Yuhao’s sixth Spirit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea and her daughter were both tearing up by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the memories of this mermaid, Huo Yuhao learned that she was called Li Ya, and her elder sister was called Li Jing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dim light flashed, and Huo Yuhao revealed a smile on his face, “Elder, I was lucky to have been successful. Although her Highness cannot recover, she can at least live in a different state. As long as I’m alive, she’ll exist.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished speaking, Huo Yuhao sat cross-legged on the ground and went into meditation. Although the mermaid was close to dying before she became his Spirit, she still carried the golden blood and lineage of the Mermaids! Her spiritual power was extremely great, even greater than her elder sister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao fused with her as a Spirit, causing his spiritual sea to balloon. Even his soul core evolved. He needed time to digest and adapt to everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">White light flashed, and the Snow Empress appeared out of thin air in front of the Princess of the Sea. She smiled at her and said, “Princess of the Sea, I’m sure you don’t think I’m fake now, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea lowered her head in guilt and answered, “Apologies, Snow Empress. I was blinded by hate. If not for the Sea God’s warning, we would have committed a serious error. However, I don’t understand why you and the Ice Empress became Spirits of this young fellow. What’s so special about him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress sighed and said, “If I had to guess, he’s a man of destiny. All of you can come out now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Snow Empress called, the other four Spirits also separated themselves from Huo Yuhao’s body and appeared in front of the Princess of the Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said, “Let me introduce her first. You know Ice, so I won’t say much about her. This is Skydream. In terms of cultivation, he was the strongest in the ice plains of the Extreme North. He’s also the only one in the continent right now whose cultivation is above a million years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea was stunned as she looked at the Skydream Iceworm, “A million years…” As a six hundred thousand year aquatic soul beast, she clearly knew how difficult it was to achieve a breakthrough at such an advanced stage of cultivation.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s unbelievable to know that a soul beast in the ice plains can actually reach a million year cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm laughed bitterly. “Snow Empress, don’t overpraise me. I’m just food to many soul beasts. Princess of the Sea, I know you are worried about your daughter. In fact, let me enlighten you with my experience.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm recounted how he had become Huo Yuhao’s first soul ring, and how the Ice Empress became his second martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like the Snow Empress mentioned, the Ice Empress, Snow Empress and Skydream Iceworm’s fusion with Huo Yuhao was a stroke of fate, whereas the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass and Ice Bear King did it of their own accord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening to the Skydream Iceworm’s account, the Princess of the Sea finally understood why Huo Yuhao was so magical, and how he had managed to come up with Spirits, which was unheard of before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said, “We didn’t have any confidence when we first followed Yuhao. However, as time passed, his character and abilities earned our recognition. He’s currently working towards the goal that he promised Skydream when he first fused with him. If he manages to fulfil it one day, we’ll be able to rise to the heavens with him, and break free from the restraints of this world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the Snow Empress’ words, the Princess of the Sea’s eyes brightened.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the Snow and Ice Empresses are taking a gamble, this young fellow’s fortune has been raised to a very high standard, given the amount of strength that he has gathered. Perhaps he might really stand a chance at breaking free from the restraints of this world. When that happens…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea started to become envious, and her imagination started to run wild. After a brief moment, she restrained the stroke of impulse in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew that her daughter carried the hope of the Mermaids when she had fused with Huo Yuhao. While she had the desire to do the same thing, she knew that she had just reached a six hundred thousand year cultivation, and still had a long time to live. The aquatic soul beasts of the Ice Sea still needed her. Furthermore, becoming a god was almost a dream! This was why she eventually restrained her desire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She then turned her attention to Tang Wutong, “You and the Sea God are…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea and Li Jing weren’t the only curious ones. Huo Yuhao’s five Spirits were also equally curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(71, 54, 36); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The changes in the late stages of the fight happened because of Tang Wutong.
