 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm chuckled and said, “When it comes to relationships, you really have to seek me for advice. I’m great at them!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How so?” the Ice Empress asked, unimpressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm replied delightedly, “Of course I’m great at them. See, I made you fall in love with me unwittingly. Am I not great?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 24pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“……” Pause… “Do you have any shame?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do Iceworms have any shame?” Brother Skydream asked casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really want to strangle you!” The Ice Empress twisted her head and looked at him fiercely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Brother Skydream looked deeply into her eyes, “Could you bear to do so?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Scram!” The Ice Empress lifted her hands and wanted to push him away. The Skydream Iceworm flipped his wrist and grabbed her arm. Naturally, he pulled her into his embrace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” The Ice Empress was furious as she struggled. However, he lowered his head and kissed her on the lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the Ice Empress’ body flashed with jade-green electricity. After this, her entire body turned rigid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If any soul beast from the Extreme North saw this, they would be greatly shocked. Ice Empress, she was the Ice Empress! She was only inferior to the Snow Empress in the Extreme North. The strongest Ice Jade Scorpion was actually kissed by someone?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm was only sneaking an attack initially, but very soon, he discovered that the Ice Empress didn’t resist at all. Her hands even tightly grabbed onto the front of his shirt, which he had conjured up using his spiritual sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could he possibly give up such a rare opportunity? The half-hearted attempt instantly turned into deep research. His kiss was extremely passionate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress’ body gradually turned from rigid to soft. Although she appeared to be trying to push the Skydream Iceworm away, she didn’t do so in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress lifted her head to look at the two of them. She shook her head helplessly and shut her eyes..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Ice Empress reacted over after being kissed many times. When she used force to push Brother Skydream away, her face was already red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He put on a fantastic ‘performance’ at this moment, revealing an indignant look on his face, as if he were a kid that had done something wrong. He lowered his head, “Ice, I was wrong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress was about to rage, but couldn’t help but be stunned when she saw him like this. Before she could even rage, she subconsciously asked, “What did you do wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm lowered his head and said, “My, my first kiss has been given to you just like that. Ice, you must take responsibility!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress was stunned for a moment. After this, she raged, “Nonsense! Wasn’t that my first kiss too?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Indeed so!” Brother Skydream instantly lifted his head. There was a look of delightful surprise on his face. Even his eyes were shining brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do! You! Want! To! Die?!” The Ice Empress’ aura ballooned. This time, she was well and truly going to rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop! Ice, clam down. Let me analyze the Snow Empress’ situation for you right now.” The Skydream Iceworm immediately changed his expression, and looked very serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress had already lifted her hand, but when she saw him like that, she eventually didn’t smack him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell me!” the Ice Empress demanded, gritting her teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm was serious as he said, “The situation that the Snow Empress is facing is very normal. Initially, she wanted to be reborn as a human and seek an important path. This was because she realized that as a soul beast, she can’t possibly overcome the limits of this world no matter how strong she is. Even if she were like Di Tian, she can’t reach the Godly Realm. This is something that soul beasts can’t accomplish. She only has a chance by being reborn as a human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, who knew that she would meet despicable humans who took her embryo away just as she was filled with hope? She was greatly tormented because of that, as she was likely to become a human soul master’s soul ring. It was Yuhao who saved her. Then, the Snow Empress didn’t even lose her awareness. She was still as strong as ever. Without any choice, she fused into Yuhao’s body and left with him. From then on, she truly entered the world of humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not long after that, her compressed origin power was completely unleashed because Yuhao absorbed the Frigid Jade Essence Bed, which led to her fusion as his Spirit. Because of that, Yuhao’s teacher had to burn his divine sense, and left this world. Although the Snow Empress didn’t explicitly say it, she has always felt that she owes Yuhao. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao treated her very well after she became the Snow Lady.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After some time, some feelings must have developed. The Snow Empress was originally the Icesky Snow Lady. In the Extreme North, all soul beasts respected and feared her. From Yuhao, she sensed unprecedented closeness. When she was still the little Snow Lady, she really treated Yuhao as her father. This was why she has found it very natural to call him ‘daddy’ all this while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right now, the Snow Empress’ choice was made because of two reasons. First, she’s tired of the lonely life she has here, and is striving to integrate into the world of humans. Second, I reckon that she has no way of leaving Yuhao. The fusion between her and Yuhao is even deeper than ours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress was astonished, and asked, “How is that possible? I am Yuhao’s martial soul! You’re not too shabby, either; you’ve even fused your spiritual origin with him! How can our fusion with him not be as deep as his with the Snow Empress?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm chuckled and answered, “You probably won’t know this. You forgot something important. When the Snow Empress became Yuhao’s Spirit, Yuhao’s teacher, Electrolux, actually burned the remnants of his divine sense. No matter what, he was halfway to becoming a God. Under such a circumstance, do you not agree that a fusion using the remnants of his divine sense would be deeper?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can feel that the Snow Empress and Yuhao might even be related by blood. This is what we lack. This also means that her origin might have become a part of Yuhao. As a teacher, Electrolux must have had left some benefits for his own disciple by sacrificing his own life. Because of that, Huo Yuhao feels much closer to the Snow Empress.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the Skydream Iceworm’s analysis, the Ice Empress forgot about how she was taken advantage of earlier, and entered a pensive state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm said, “Alright, Ice. I’m going to return to Yuhao’s body to cultivate. I haven’t fully absorbed the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence.” After he finished speaking, he turned into a beam of flowing light and vanished into Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief moment, the Ice Empress reacted.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I haven’t settled my score with this scoundrel for taking advantage of me!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao was cultivating right now. She couldn’t possibly cause a disturbance in his spiritual sea! She was immediately furious as she pouted her lips. However, she turned slightly red from embarrassment when she recalled how the Skydream Iceworm had kissed her. Apart from embarrassment, she also felt a slight sense of sweetness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-----------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao awoke from his meditation, he only felt that his entire body had become completely clear. In this short span of time, he felt as if he had turned into a block of ice, and sensed the eternal past of ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when he opened his eyes, he immediately discovered that he was probably the only one who thought that only a short amount of time had passed. This was because there were a bunch of Tai Tan Snowdevils standing around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tai Tan Snowdevil King was standing in front. Not far from him was the Ice Bear King. Evidently, they had returned after accounting to their own people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress was still standing beside Huo Yuhao, and smiled as she said, “You’re awake. You’ve achieved pretty good results.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the smile on her face, both the Tai Tan Snowdevil King and Ice Bear King were in a daze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress has smiled? Since when has she liked smiling? Is she smiling for this weak human being?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao drifted up and nodded at the Snow Empress before saying, “I don’t know what I’ve comprehended, but it feels good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said, “We still need to wait for a while before we can leave. Ice has also returned to her own people. I’m not sure whether she’ll return upon leaving this time. She’ll need to account to her own species, too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao was moved. After fusing with the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, the Ice Empress’ origin had indeed been completely consolidated. She could now remain some distance from Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress shared a strong sense of telepathy with him, and naturally knew what he was thinking. She nodded and said, “At least within the core region of the Extreme North. However, she can’t do it for too long. After all, our origins are in your body. If they remain too far away from you, their spiritual sense will weaken. They can only recover in your body. After leaving your body, they’ll only be draining themselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see.” Huo Yuhao was enlightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress didn’t make them wait too long. In less than two hours, she had already turned returned as a beam of jade-green light and returned. However, she didn’t say anything, and directly fused back into Huo Yuhao’s body. Her separation from her own species had inevitably left her slightly depressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King and Tai Tan Snowdevil King opened their eyes wide when they saw the Ice Empress fusing into Huo Yuhao’s body just like that. They didn’t know what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress calmly said, “Alright, let’s move on.” As she spoke, she dragged Huo Yuhao up and landed on the Ice Bear King’s wide shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Huo Yuhao’s first time sitting on an Ice Bear. He felt like he was sitting on a mountain as he sat on the Ice Bear King’s shoulders. The massive Tai Tan Snowdevil King, the new leader of the ice plains of the Extreme North,was even beside him!</span></p>
