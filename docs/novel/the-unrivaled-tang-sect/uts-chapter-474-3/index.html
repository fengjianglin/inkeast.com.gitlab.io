 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked at the Snow Empress and asked, “Snow Empress, are you using the Tai Tan Snowdevil King to deal with the Sun Moon Empire?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress nodded and answered, “Your individual strength is too weak. Furthermore, the Sun Moon Empire has invaded our territory, which makes them our enemy. To us, this is an insider thing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and didn’t say anything else. The Snow Empress turned back and didn’t look at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing her ravishing face, Huo Yuhao felt his heart soften. He wasn’t developing romantic feelings. Instead, he was thinking about the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To him, the little Snow Lady was like his daughter and younger sister. What about the Snow Lady now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder sister?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought about an elder sister, Huo Yuhao felt a sudden heartache.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s been a long time. I wonder how Sister Xiaotao is. After we parted, Qiu’er sacrificed herself. Then, my emotions were very unstable, and I had to face the beast wave from the Great Star Dou Forest. I had no choice but to rush back to Shrek City. After that, it was the war against the Sun Moon Empire. I don’t know where Sister Xiaotao is. Even though I helped to suppress the evil fire in her, it’s already been a long time. Her evil fire might have acted up again. Will she be involved in the war? If that’s the case, how can I face her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, I must save her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his recent experiences, Huo Yuhao had confidence inhelping Ma Xiaotao with the evil fire in her body. Among his various options, the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence was the best choice. As long as he fused some of the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence in his body into Ma Xiaotao, he could completely neutralize her evil fire with the help of the Ice Empress, Snow Empress, and Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass. If the three Ultimate Ice Spirits that he had couldn’t do it, there wouldn’t be anyone in the world who could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought about that, Huo Yuhao decided that he had to find her when he went to the Heavenly Soul Empire.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I hope I can find her. If I find her, I’ll be able to find out about Teacher Xiao Ya, too. I hope she’s okay...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Huo Yuhao was in deep thought, the Snow Empress didn’t disrupt him. She quietly sat on the Ice Bear King’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the Ice Bear King was huge, he was also very quick when he started galloping. He was like a mountain that was sliding on ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were more than a hundred Tai Tan Snowdevils running with him. They were huge. Every step they took covered more than a hundred meters. When they leapt up, they could cover more than five hundred meters. In just two leaps, they covered one kilometer! Given such power, they could match Huo Yuhao’s all-out flying speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the great strength of the Extreme North. No wonder the ice plains of the Extreme North were a promised land. It had close ties with their immense abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the astonishment in Huo Yuhao’s eyes, the Snow Empress smiled and said, “This is the core strength of the Extreme North. The strength we can utilize is something that you can’t imagine. It’s just like how you’ve never seen the core strength of the Great Star Dou Forest before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” After hearing the Snow Empress mentioning the Great Star Dou Forest, Huo Yuhao’s curiosity was piqued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve not seen the core strength of the Great Star Dou Forest? Don’t tell me that the Five Great Savage Beasts that started the beast wave didn’t form their core strength?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress shook her head and said, “The Five Great Savage Beasts are the strongest soul beasts in the Great Star Dou Forest right now. However, if we’re talking about core strength, it’s not been utilized yet. In fact, your knowledge of Di Tian is still sorely lacking. He doesn’t rule just the entire Great Star Dou Forest. He’s the spokesperson of ALL soul beasts. If he really wanted to go all-out to deal with humans, the Great Star Dou Forest wouldn’t be the only ones to have attacked. Even the Extreme North would also have to accept his commands and attack humans. When that happens, it’ll be destruction for both sides. Humans are indeed quite strong. However, the hundreds of thousands and million-year cultivations that we have can’t be easily overcome. Even if the humans win, the destruction to the continent would still be immense.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait a minute.” Huo Yuhao suddenly exclaimed and asked, “Snow Lady, what did you say just now? What do you mean when you say that Di Tian is the spokesperson of all soul beasts? Don’t tell me that there’s a stronger and more powerful soul beast in this world?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress nodded seriously and answered, “Yes, there is. At least, that’s what the legends say. In the continent, apart from strange existences like the Skydream Iceworm, we also acknowledge that Di Tian is the strongest and oldest. The Evileye Tyrant is only inferior to him. Only living beings like us that have been around for so long know about the existence of a Lord.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao asked, “Who is this Lord of Soul Beasts? If even Di Tian calls him Lord, isn’t he a God then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled and explained, “The Lord of Soul Beasts is a God. You should have heard before that our Lord is the Dragon God. The Dragon God is the earliest soul beast to have been birthed, and has his own Godly Seat in the Godly Realm. For some unknown reason, the Dragon God perished, but all the soul beasts on the Douluo Continent recognize him as our Lord. He has nine sons, but we don’t really consider his children as our lords. Rather, we recognize his avatar after he perished as our Lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The legends say that the Dragon God wasn’t accepted into the Godly Realm because he was a soul beast. He separated into two different dragons, and has always been one tier away from being a God. These two dragons are the Golden Dragon and Silver Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Among them, the Golden Dragon inherited the great strength of the Dragon God, whereas the Silver Dragon inherited the Dragon God’s control of the elements: water, fire, earth, wind, light, and darkness. Both of them excelled in their own fields, and were very powerful. They dominated the entire Douluo Continent, and ruled the world of soul beasts together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Back then, when the two Dragon Kings and nine sons of the Dragon God ruled, the dragon species was extremely strong. &nbsp;Dragons ruled over all the soul beasts. Afterward, it seemed like a catastrophe hit the Douluo Continent. The two Dragon Kings led the nine sons and the other powerful dragons to resist that catastrophe. Eventually, almost all of them died. Di Tian seems to be the only remaining powerful dragon from that catastrophe. This is why I said that he’s the spokesperson of the Lord of Soul Beasts. It’s because he’s the strongest dragon to have survived, and his blood lineage is the purest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The legends also posit that there was a descendant of the Dragon God that survived. As for who it is, only Di Tian might know. I’m not clear on it. However, I’ve sensed the oldest soul beast to have ever existed in the Great Star Dou Forest. This soul beast is indeed very strong. Its strength is hidden within the entire Great Star Dou Forest. He’s not the only one. There is another beast whose job is to protect it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Di Tian controls this strength. That is the true core strength of the Great Star Dou Forest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To Huo Yuhao, the Snow Empress’ words could only be explained by the legends. Was there really someone stronger in the Great Star Dou Forest?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Snow Lady, who do you reckon this surviving ancient dragon to be?” Huo Yuhao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress shook her head and said, “I’m not clear either. I believe that it’s more likely to be one of the Dragon God’s nine sons. Of course, it could also be the Golden Dragon King or Silver Dragon King. However, this possibility is a little too low. After all, the strengths of the two Dragon Kings were very critical in resisting the catastrophe. As they were the avatars of the Dragon God, they can’t possibly produce offspring. If their actual bodies were still around, do you really think humans could rule the continent?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chortled and argued, “It’s not impossible! If they were greatly hurt in that catastrophe, they might need time to recuperate...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress laughed, “You’d better not be wishing for that scenario to happen. If that’s the case, humans will be in grave danger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and laughed. “I’m only kidding. If someone as powerful as him survived, how could he possibly not have recovered after so many years? However, since you’ve sensed that there are other powers in the Great Star Dou Forest, they might really be Di Tian’s trump card.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled and said, “Do you know why I told you all this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “Don’t tell me that you’re trying to dissuade me from resisting Di Tian?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress shook her head and replied, “Of course not. I’m giving you encouragement. Furthermore, I’m also trying to tell you that Di Tian might not be your strongest enemy. There might be someone stronger in the Great Star Dou Forest. This is why you should never be overly pleased with yourself, even when you become very strong in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded seriously and said, “I won’t be.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and the Snow Empress sat on the Ice Bear King’s body and used much less time to return to their target area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The aura of hundreds of charging Tai Tan Snowdevils was simply too strong. The Snow Empress asked them to stop when they were around fifty kilometers away from the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
