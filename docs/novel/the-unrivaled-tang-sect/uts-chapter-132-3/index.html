But Dai Huabin and the others naturally wouldn’t know the exact figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The best way to avoid the Golden Road was to leap to either side. This was what Dai Huabin and the others did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin, Wu Feng, Zhu Lu and Xie Huanyue all leapt to the left, while Huang Chutian, Cui Yajie and Long Xiangyue leapt to the right. The 7 of them were separated now, and acted freely on their own. What formation was there to speak of now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An intense blue halo was emitted from behind Class 1. Countless blue streaks turned into a huge net that stretched towards one side. The net covered Huang Chutian, Long Xiangyue and Cui Yajie. This was the Hairnet unleashed by Lan Susu and Lan Luoluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Class 1 managed to unleash their full strength under Huo Yuhao’s dispatch. Cao Jinxuan’s Time-Elapsing Clock rose up silently behind him. His second soul ring flashed with a yellow light. The light distorted and landed on Huang Chutian. It was the Time Lock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Chutian was very familiar with Lan Susu and Lan Luoluo. The Hairnet was this pair of sisters’ first soul skill. Although it was very restrictive, it could still be overcome with enough force. But everything around him seemed to go still just as he was about to unleash his power. He stood there in a daze without moving too. Cao Jinxuan’s Time Lock had locked time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cao Jinxuan was able to become a core disciple of the outer courtyard because of his magical Time-Elasping Clock’s special time-type soul skill. It couldn’t be shaken off easily. Even though Huang Chutian’s cultivation was above his, he was still paralyzed for two seconds in front of the Time Lock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two seconds were enough for the Hairnet to be put to use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiangyue and Cui Yajie seemed to have become dazed, and the Hairnet descended on them. They were both agility-type soul masters, and didn’t possess Huang Chutian’s strength. They were helpless after they were covered by the Lan sisters’ Hairnet. It was even too late for Huang Chutian after he was trapped. Countless needle-like strands of hair also quickly blocked their sensitive areas. It was the Lan sisters’ second soul skill, Pierce. Huang Chutian might be very strong, but he was a strength-type soul master, and not a defense-type soul master. He didn’t dare to use his body to test the close-range, all-around attack of the Pierce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">3 out of the 7 were already down, including a Soul Elder. It couldn’t be much simpler than this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Jin was totally stunned. What was going on?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s actions didn’t stop. He used Imitation to scam his opponents first before using the Spiritual Detection Sharing to help the Lan sisters’ Hairnet to determine their precise location and enable Cao Jinxuan to use the Time Lock to paralyze Huang Chutian. He unleashed his Spiritual Interference to affect Long Xiangyue and Cui Yajie. He did all this in one shot without stopping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he was doing all this, he burst towards Dai Huabin and the others along with Wang Dong, Xiao Xiao and Zhou Sichen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin let out a tiger’s roar. He twisted his head and burst towards Huo Yuhao. Zhu Lu chased after Dai Huabin hurriedly, whereas Xie Huanyue and Wu Feng stayed close to the both of them. Although 3 of them had lost their ability to fight, the remaining 4 of them were the core of the team’s abilities. They were not totally helpless if they banded together. After all, this was just a competition, and their lives were not at stake. Class 1 had also used 3 members to control Huang Chutian and the other two. They believed that they still had a fighting chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao’s Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute sounded at this point. The four of them reduced their speed quickly. Following that, a huge cauldron appeared and divided into 3 parts instantly. It was the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Wang Dong couldn’t use both his martial souls at the same time in the past. Only Huo Yuhao could control the appearance of both his martial souls using his Spirit Eyes’ immense spiritual power. However, Xiao Xiao managed to do so now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps her limelight was always taken by Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. But she still possessed twin martial souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three cauldrons were positioned in the worst possible positions for Dai Huabin and the other 3. They were completely separated from one another because of the 3 cauldrons, and the cauldrons were also accurately placed in the paths that they had to cross to reach one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had to stop, as they were intercepted at high speed. In addition, Xiao Xiao had grasped the precise timing to make her move because of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin burst forward on his own, while his 3 teammates behind him stalled for a second and were stopped by the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed as if he was purposely left on his own, and he wasn’t even aware of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong advanced together. While Huo Yuhao used the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track to advance towards Dai Huabin, Wang Dong had already disappeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin might possess a strong fighting will, but he was still petrified when he had to face Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. He roared and unleashed both his first and third soul skills—the White Tiger’s Shield and White Tiger’s Vajra Transformation, causing a sharp aura to instantly arise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Yueheng and Dai Huabin possessed the same first 3 soul skills. But Huo Yuhao didn’t feel any pressure against Dai Huabin now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin’s aura was even more acute than Dai Yueheng’s, but it lacked the steadiness and reservation of Dai Yueheng’s aura, which resembled a suppressed volcano.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin’s second soul ring also lit up as he roared at a distance of 3 meters from Huo Yuhao. The White Tiger’s Fierce Light Wave surged towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he couldn’t conceal any of his actions with the Spiritual Detection Sharing around. Huo Yuhao slipped 3 feet laterally and avoided the White Tiger’s Fierce Light Wave. He also inched closer to Dai Huabin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin sensed an abrupt, sharp aura and subconsciously lifted his right arm quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ding!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A golden light flashed before disappearing. Dai Huabin felt his right arm turning numb, and his body shook until he stopped moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’s Guillotine Wings?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An ominous feeling suddenly rose in his heart. He couldn’t see Wang Dong’s actions with Huo Yuhao’s Imitation concealing him. How could he continue to fight? He was outnumbered, and Wang Dong was even a three-ringed Soul Elder. His will to win was crushed. He also discovered that Wang Dong’s soul power was much greater than before. He had put himself at a disadvantage amidst his haste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His thoughts ran quickly as the battle continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Guillotine Wings stopped Dai Huabin, Huo Yuhao also slapped both his hands towards Dai Huabin. His palms flashed with a diamond glow, as if he were wearing a pair of diamond gloves. A streak of ultimate, chilly air rose up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ice Empress’ Pincer</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin used his right arm to block Wang Dong’s attack. He lifted his left arm and his claws opened wide. He didn’t dodge as he stretched his left arm forward to claw at Huo Yuhao’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His arm wasn’t much longer than Huo Yuhao’s arm, but it was different with the tiger’s claw. If Huo Yuhao continued to attack him, his own chest would also be pierced by the tiger’s claw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin’s choice was right. He reckoned that Huo Yuhao couldn’t challenge him in terms of strength, even with Wang Dong’s help. Huo Yuhao had no choice but to dodge this strike. There was no other way out for him. Once Huo Yuhao stepped back, Dai Huabin could also retreat rapidly and gather his teammates again before attacking once more. He had no more confidence in fighting Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao didn’t hide. He clasped his palms before his left hand slapped the outer area of Dai Huabin’s left wrist. His right hand also slapped the inner area of Dai Huabin’s right arm.</span></p>

He thought to himself how Huo Yuhao couldn’t blame anyone but himself for seeking death. He concentrated his soul power in his left arm. With the White Tiger’s Shield and White Tiger’s Vajra Transformation’s enhancements, the strength of his strike couldn’t be blocked easily, even by a four-ringed Soul Ancestor.</span></p>

Dai Huabin’s left arm was instantly distorted, and changed shape. His tiger claw was wrenched away before it could claw at Huo Yuhao’s chest as his arm was snapped.</span></p>

He didn’t believe what had just happened in front of him. Furthermore, he didn’t feel an intense pain. That’s because an ultimate chill was injected into his arm as soon as it snapped, freezing his broken arm and nerves.</span></p>
