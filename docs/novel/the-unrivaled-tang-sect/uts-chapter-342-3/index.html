 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soul Sage immediately sensed that something was wrong, and armed himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second level’s soul tool defense mechanisms were a lot more rigorous than the first level, but the alarm was inside the third level’s main gate, and only that alarm could reach the outside world. The people who were standing guard here before this were alerted to what was happening at the Royal Palace through this alarm mechanism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soul Sage was just getting ready to run into the third gate when the gate in front of him suddenly crumbled, and he almost subconsciously fired his aging ray.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pity that he was faced with Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon Spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This middle-aged Soul Sage had a lot of experience, and he didn’t underestimate his adversaries even though he was facing three young girls. He activated all his soul tools at once, and immediately began to retreat as fast as he could. He had only one goal; there were many booby traps that were set up all around the second level, and he only had to lure his adversaries inside and trigger those traps. The traps would definitely hurt his attackers even if they were Titled Douluo! Furthermore, he didn’t know how many intruders there were, so his best choice was to sound the alarm as soon as possible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He made his decision because of these considerations, and bolted backwards as fast as he could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er was fast, but this Soul Sage had Class 7 soul tools. He was caught off-guard, and he didn’t have any particularly powerful soul tools that had to be charged up, but Wang Dong’er’s physical body wasn’t strong enough to withstand his attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er unleashed streak after streak of her Light of the Butterfly Goddess to defend herself against her opponent’s attacks as she lashed out with her Guillotine Wings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Class 7 soul engineer could possibly have escaped if Huo Yuhao hadn’t been there. However, how could Huo Yuhao not plan their combat strategically now that he had locked onto his opponent’s position?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Black light stretched across the air without warning, and an enormous cauldron accurately appeared in the path that the Class 7 soul engineer had to pass in his retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao’s Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron’s barricade was very effective! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The secret warehouse’s second level was similar to the first, and there were many automatic triggers laid out all over the ground. Soul tools would be triggered and concentrate their attacks on whoever stepped on these automatic triggers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had used his spiritual power to stalk Li Chong into this place, and this was the reason why he was relatively familiar with the second level. Under such circumstances, the huge cauldron was placed precisely at a spot that the Soul Sage could retreat safely to. There was space around the cauldron, but those were spaces were where the booby traps were located. The Soul Sage would bring death upon himself if he accidentally stepped on one of those triggers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Class 7 soul engineer was quite sensitive, and he felt so despondent that he wanted to vomit blood when the large cauldron appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He immediately leapt up and attempted to jump over the cauldron, but how could Xiao Xiao give him this chance? Her three Threelives Soulcrush Cauldrons were stacked like a pyramid as they blocked his path and cut off every spot he could retreat to. The cauldrons’ tops were almost touching the ceiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Class 7 soul engineer was getting a little worried and desperate. Light erupted from the soul tools on his body, and a dark red metal sphere appeared in his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fuck, that’s a Class 7 explosive bomb! Is he not afraid of destroying everything here?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao cursed silently. He passed a message to Wang Qiu’er and Wang Dong’er through his Spiritual Detection, “What are you two waiting for? Do you really want everyone to die here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s eyes were a little hesitant, but her hesitance disappeared as she tapped her foot on the ground and followed behind Wang Dong’er as fast as she could. She tossed the Life Guardian Blade in her hands, and the carving knife flew out of her hands like a green beam of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soul Sage in front of them had seven soul rings. However, the Sun Moon Empire’s seven-ringed Soul Sages couldn’t be gauged with the same criteria as typical seven-ringed soul masters could, as long as they were soul engineers. The reason was because their standards weren’t on the same scale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Simply put, this Class 7 soul engineer wouldn’t have much of a chance against Wang Qiu’er if he were up against her one versus one in a restricted area of battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He possessed the advantages that soul engineers typically had, but he also had all their weaknesses... and their main weakness was their reaction time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The green light flashed by far too quickly. Wang Qiu’er’s strength was unrivaled, and the Class 7 soul engineer felt the light change in front of him as the metal sphere that he had just retrieved only got three feet into the air before it was struck by that green light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A carving knife?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The Class 7 soul engineer could finally tell. Soul engineers were exceptionally sensitive towards carving knives, and so he was momentarily stunned at the sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The green carving knife released green light in all directions, and he watched as, in the next moment, the Class 7 explosive bomb that he had tossed out transformed into a sphere of green light before it vanished into thin air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How is that possible?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul engineer was petrified, and his first reaction was to protect himself. Golden light flashed across his body as an Invincible Barrier that could last for fifteen seconds shimmered into being. His first thought at a time like this was how he could survive. Furthermore, he believed that fifteen seconds was enough for him to be able to trigger the soul tool mechanisms around him, and he was confident that these traps were enough to stop these people!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was momentarily dazed once more at such a crucial time. He was stunned, as what was transpiring before him was simply too peculiar and insidious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was one young girl with flowing pinkish-blue long hair who was catching up to another young girl with outstretched wings. Both of them looked exactly the same, and they were both mouthwateringly beautiful. Stranger things continued to unfold as the young girl who was coming up from behind flung the spear in her hands forward before hovering in front of the other young girl. That young girl then tightly embraced the other young girl with butterfly wings in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dazzling golden light instantly blinded the soul engineer, and a tremendous shockwave came at him from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Invincible Barrier could protect his body, but there was nothing it could do against such an immense impact from shockwaves like that. He could only rely on his own strength to defend himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Invincible Barrier relaxed a little, and caused him to stumble forward unwittingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was in this moment that the two figures who had merged together transformed in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bluish-gold butterfly wings became a brilliant gold, while flowing lines appeared on the enchanting butterfly wings as her upper wings cracked open. Two became four, while the lower wings shifted down to allow space for the new pair. Even stranger, the butterfly wings were a lot wider and larger than before... they were clearly miniature dragon wings! Furthermore, those wings were covered with diamond-shaped golden dragon scales.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Six dragon wings... there were actually six golden dragon wings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her enchanting features didn’t change, and her long, flowing pinkish-blue hair was no different from before, but there was now another crystal-like layer on her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single strand of her hair was translucent, as if they were formed from crystal lattices, and pinkish-blue hues circulated on top of every strand as if they were neon lights. Her long hair draped behind her back, and her golden dragon wings stretched out while her body became a lot taller than before. Golden armor covered her entire body, and the soul engineer could see that the armor was pieced together with fine, compact scales. She didn’t have a helmet, but she wore a strange headband; there was a golden dragon’s head imprinted in the center, with two butterfly wings on each side of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This incredibly beautiful being raised her right hand, which now had dragon scales as a handguard, and reached out for the Golden Dragon Spear in front of her. Crisp and bright dragon roars resonated through the entire level in the next moment, and golden light flickered as innumerable golden beams rained down on the Invincible Barrier in front of her.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrill cracking sounds could be heard, and the soul engineer looked on incredulously as golden light detonated before his eyes. He had had absolute faith in his Class 7 Invincible Barrier, but it lasted for less than two seconds. He didn’t even have enough time to recover from his daze and how befuddled he was before his Invincible Barrier was dispelled!</span></p>

He couldn’t think of anything else afterwards because the entire world had turned dark before his eyes.</span></p>

She pointed the spear in her hands diagonally down, and there seemed to be a disdainful look in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao’s eyes were wide and stupefied. Even Huo Yuhao in his spiritual form was dumbfounded by what he had just witnessed.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was only one word missing from this name compared to their three-way martial soul fusion skill, and its strength was definitely inferior in comparison. However, this Golden Butterfly Dragon Transformation was the strongest skill that they could unleash at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had calculated the power they had unleashed when they were in their Purple Golden Butterfly Dragon Transformation after the match ended. Afterwards, he was sure that the strength that they possessed in that state was near the pinnacle of what an eight-ringed Soul Douluo could reach. Even though such a circumstance was difficult to replicate, this was the best they could do for now.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How did Huo Yuhao know that Dong’er and Qiu’er could unleash a fusion skill like this? The reason was simple. He could undergo his own martial soul fusion with Wang Dong’er and Wang Qiu’er individually with one hundred percent compatibility, while the three of them could unleash a three-way fusion skill. It would be very strange if Wang Dong’er and Wang Qiu’er couldn’t fuse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao began to truly wonder in that moment whether Wang Dong’er and Wang Qiu’er were actually biological sisters. They looked so similar to one another, and their martial souls could fuse. There was no other possibility that he could think of besides the fact that they were biological sisters!</span></p>
