 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The turquoise radiance became increasingly intense and illuminated the surrounding area. After being suppressed by the aura of Ultimate Ice, the Blazing Sunspring that had just broken free from the Extreme Chill Icespring radiated huge waves of heat. It brought about a scorching aura that resisted the chilly intent radiating from Huo Yuhao’s body, greatly reducing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the azure-green radiance expanded to its limit, it started to slowly shrink back and became dimmer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As this radiance expanded and retracted, Huo Yuhao felt much less bloated, and finally managed to relax.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Undoubtedly, this change was brought about by the Skydream Iceworm. Huo Yuhao’s body was filled with the vital energy of heaven and earth. Even Skydream didn’t dare to circulate his soul power. If something went wrong, the weaker passageways in his body might burst!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this didn’t mean that he was helpless. As a million-year soul beast in Huo Yuhao’s body, after Huo Yuhao fused with his spiritual origin he completely understood every part of Huo Yuhao’s body. It wasn’t even far-fetched to claim that the Skydream Iceworm understood Huo Yuhao’s body better than Huo Yuhao himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t possible to circulate Huo Yuhao’s soul power and absorb it because he was already saturated. However, he could use a different method! Huo Yuhao’s passageways weren’t the toughest part of his body; that was his soul bones!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Skydream activated the power of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s skeleton. As a hundred-thousand year soul beast, the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s skeleton sealed the origin energy of the Ice Empress. The Frigid Jade Essence Bed was originally used to further the fusion, but no one had expected a sudden reversal in the Snow Empress’ soul power that made it perilous. This also caused the Ice Empress to enter a state of hibernation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Huo Yuhao’s body had already reached its limit, he couldn’t withstand the strength of the Ultimate Ice anymore. However, the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s skeleton hadn’t reached its limit yet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under Skydream’s control, a part of the origin energy was absorbed as the radiance expanded and retracted. This helped to neutralize the crisis that Huo Yuhao was facing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blue-green radiance appeared once again, ballooning in size before shrinking. The external Blazing Sunspring’s frightening heat helped to protect Huo Yuhao at this point. Because of its suppression, the Skydream Iceworm was able to dispel the remaining chill as he helped to compress the origin energy of heaven and earth into Yuhao’s skeleton. This made the entire shrinkage process much smoother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This carried on several times. After nine consecutive times, Huo Yuhao’s body wasn’t just exuding an turquoise radiance anymore, he had actually turned pale blue. His body was still aching, but at least he was able to move now. He felt much more comfortable once he could move his body. However, his soul power had stalled, as it was affected by the origin energy. Only a fifth of it was able to circulate, and even then, the circulation was much slower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, the skeleton has also reached its limit. It can’t compress any further, otherwise there might be danger. You can only rely on time to continue absorbing this strength. The Snow Empress was a little extreme. I’m afraid you won’t be able to unleash your full abilities for some time. However, the Extreme Chill Icespring will be very beneficial in waking up the Ice Empress. After all, her spiritual sense will recover faster under the nourishment of the origin energy of pure Ultimate Ice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm was rather exhausted. After all, most of his spiritual origin had fused with Huo Yuhao. Now that he had activated the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s skeleton, it was equivalent to him establishing a connection with Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power again. He was helping Huo Yuhao now, and wasn’t just controlling on his own power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thanks, Brother Skydream. I feel much better.” Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh of relief and released a gust of white gas from his mouth, releasing a chill into the region that the Blazing Delicate Apricot occupied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Blazing Delicate Apricot, please open a path. I’ll go over to Youyou’s side.” He struggled to stand up and looked at Wang Qiu’er, gesturing to her that he was fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot wasn’t in a particularly good mood. She couldn’t wait for Huo Yuhao to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After groaning, she immediately instructed the surrounding plants to open a path for Huo Yuhao to return. She wanted to act up, but she didn’t when she saw the Snow Lady on Huo Yuhao’s shoulder. She was traumatized after almost being crushed into powder. It was her first time experiencing such a complete elemental suppression of her abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could walk, but he estimated that his current abilities were only as good as they were when he was at Rank 30. It was difficult for him to even activate flying-type soul tools. His meridians were still aching, too. The surfeit caused great harm to his body and could definitely be called an internal injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the air that he was exhaling was extremely cold. He also looked pale, and his body felt very cold. This was the huge price he had to pay for the Snow Empress’ awakening!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao revealed a bitter smile on his face. Ever since the Snow Empress had entered his body, he had suffered greatly. The last time, it was a complete reversal of the Snow Empress’ strength in his body, causing Electrolux to burn his divine sense in a bid to save him. This time, he almost blew apart. It was a huge headache for him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this encounter had also enlightened him. Huo Yuhao realized that he could restore the Snow Empress’ memories temporarily if he possessed immense Ultimate Ice soul power. He could even unleash her tremendous abilities. Of course, he couldn’t do it with his current cultivation. The Snow Empress only appeared today when he tapped into the origin energy of heaven and earth from the Extreme Chill Icespring. If he wanted the Snow Empress to really make a move, he needed to have at least seven or eight soul rings. Furthermore, it would at most be the for only one or two attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was good that there was such a possibility. It was like his eldest senior’s Radiant Holy Dragon’s Awakening, and his third senior’s Xuanwu turtle’s Awakening. It’s just that the Snow Empress’ Awakening was of a more advanced level. In addition, he had no control over her, either. He had to take things slowly. Perhaps the Snow Empress’ memory could be fully restored when he became a Transcendent Douluo in the future...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought of that, Huo Yuhao turned to look at the Snow Lady on his shoulder. He still believed that she was much better right now, rather than with the Snow Empress’ memories. At least the Snow Lady listened to him. Furthermore, she was very cute! The Snow Empress was too cold, just like Wang Qiu’er…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er followed behind him, and her nose started to turn itchy. She looked as if she wanted to sneeze, but she managed to suppress it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she looked at Huo Yuhao, she could sense that he wasn’t feeling well even though she didn’t know what was happening to him. However, she could still feel it due to their martial soul fusion. The frightening Awakened existence had caused great damage to his body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, things became much smoother after he paid the huge price. This was evident from the Blazing Delicate Apricot’s attitude. Who would dare to offend the terrifying existence in Huo Yuhao’s body? It had released an extremely strong aura that could destroy everything here. Even Wang Qiu’er was petrified when she faced the might of the Snow Empress. She had only ever experienced a similar feeling when she…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh of relief as he returned to the Delicate Silk Immortal’s side. He lowered his head to look at a book in front of him and said to her, “Apologies, You You! I didn’t imagine something like this would happen. Perhaps I was provoked by something in the outside world, and thus the Snow Empress was Awakened.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The huge, pink flower on the Delicate Silk Immortal was still blooming. However, the scent was less evident. She groaned and said, “Stop shedding crocodile tears. Hmph, return my pill if you are truly apologetic.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What left Wang Qiu’er and the Delicate Silk Immortal shocked was that Huo Yuhao actually retrieved the pill and nodded as he said, “Alright, I’ll return it to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he actually walked towards the Delicate Silk Immortal and passed her the pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? You’re really returning it to me?” If the Delicate Silk Immortal could reveal facial expressions, she would be very stunned right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said sincerely, “You You, I didn’t come here to look for treasure, I’m not looking to obtain anything. I’m only here to retrieve the Yearning Heartbroken Grass for my lover. I hope to receive your help. I’m extremely apologetic for what the Snow Empress did to all of you earlier. I don’t want this to cause a conflict between us. Not only am I returning this pill to you, but I’ll also return what the Snow Empress took from the Blazing Delicate Apricot. I just hope that there are no more obstructions, and I can search for the Yearning Heartbroken Grass.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal was incredulous. “Wait, wait. Huo Yuhao, do you know what you’re saying? You must know that the Blazing Rubber that Ah Jiao produces is of top-notch quality. A normal Blazing Delicate Apricot can produce very little of the rubber even after ten thousand years. Such a large quantity of rubber is sufficient to increase the cultivation of fire-type soul masters to the level of the Ultimate Fire. It’s very valuable! My pill is even more impressive. If you have it, all lethal poison will lose its effect within a three hundred square foot region. Even if you are infected by poison and the poison has entered your blood, the poison can be dispelled once you place the pill in your mouth. They are considered treasures! Priceless treasures! Are you going to give them up just like that?”</span></p>
