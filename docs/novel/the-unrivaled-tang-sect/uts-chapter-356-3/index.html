 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the current development of human-shaped soul tools, it would be difficult for Huo Yuhao to be stronger and better than he normally was without it. Furthermore, this was designed and made at the last minute, with absolutely no add-ons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er lifted her hand, and a golden light started to shine. She gripped her Golden Dragon Spear tightly in her hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she saw the bright-golden spear appear, a look of worry crossed Wang Dong’er’s face as she watched from afar. Weapons had no eyes. This was different from a bare-handed brawl. Why was Qiu’er so serious?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you ready?” As Wang Qiu’er raised her Golden Dragon Spear, a layer of golden fog started to waft from her body. The air started to shine with a golden layer of light. A powerful soul power surged forth from her body and targeted Huo Yuhao, coming toward him with the force of a tidal wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Faced with this suppression, Huo Yuhao controlled his human-shaped soul tool with his spiritual power. He stepped out with his left leg and squatted slightly with his body. He raised both hands in a defensive gesture in front of him. At the same time, a layer of golden light shone from his body. This was the energy of his Sovereign’s Descent. Following that, a golden figure floated behind his back. This was his unique skill, Goddess of Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Faced with an opponent like Wang Qiu’er, Huo Yuhao did not dare to hold back at all. He knew that Wang Qiu’er was able to improve even more from this tournament. All aspects of her power showed improvement, and her abilities were even stronger than before. Furthermore, he was rather immobile; he could only move with the help of his human-shaped soul tool. In a one-on-one fight, it would be difficult to beat her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he had to be careful. Huo Yuhao did not care so much as to whether he would win or lose to her. There was nothing shameful about losing to Wang Qiu’er. All he wanted was to not lose too badly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bring it on!” Huo Yuhao cried out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er narrowed her eyes. The look in her eyes became razor-sharp. She bent forward slightly, then charged. Almost instantly, she appeared in front of Huo Yuhao. She stabbed at Huo Yuhao’s chest with her Golden Dragon Spear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An emerald light flashed, and a thick emerald-green pillar about the size of Huo Yuhao’s chest shot out. It met Wang Qiu’er’s attack head-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao understood Wang Qiu’er’s strength too well. This tyrannical woman loved to charge straight ahead when she fought. At such a close distance, he would rather use his own judgment than depend on Spiritual Detection.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, the moment he shouted ‘bring it on’, Huo Yuhao had already activated his Ice Empress’ Wrath.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ultimate Ice took the shape of an emerald-green pillar, which crashed straight into Wang Qiu’er. She was like a moth that flew straight into the fire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An intense golden light shone from Wang Qiu’er’s body. The golden fog protected her, and it was able to resist against Ice Empress’ Wrath. Furthermore, an umbrella-like light shone from the Golden Dragon Spear in her hands. While Huo Yuhao managed to stop her, he could not push her back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the two yellow, two purple, and two black soul rings on Wang Qiu’er’s body, two of them lit up together. The strength of her first soul skill, Golden Dragon Body, and her second soul skill, Dragon’s Strength, were both activated. She roared and, basking in the power of her two soul skills, continued to pierce through Ice Empress’ Wrath. Her target was Huo Yuhao’s chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as the Ice Empress’ Wrath helped to block her, Huo Yuhao was able to resolve his speed and agility problems. Borrowing the light of Ultimate Ice from the Ice Empress’ Wrath, he took a few steps back. The golden figure behind him turned into a ball of intense light as he met Wang Qiu’er’s attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An intense energy burst forth on top of the wheel. It rose high up into the air like a tornado.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the spectators not only included Wang Dong’er, but also Wu Feng and Ning Tian. While they could not sense the power, they could still watch. As they watched, their faces changed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">We’re all of the same age, so why are they so powerful? It’s understandable for the captain, as she’s almost 20 years old. However, Huo Yuhao is only 17, but he’s so powerful! He can even match the captain and… and he has the advantage right now…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was right. Huo Yuhao had the advantage in this clash!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An intense explosion rang through the air, and energy surged upward. Both Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er had neglected something, and that was the fact that they were fighting in a rather small area. When such a strong soul power kicked in, the strength of the rebound made the entire area around them vibrate. Neither of them could stand straight as they both hurriedly retreated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Huo Yuhao’s advantage became clear. He had used the Ice Empress’ Wrath to slow Wang Qiu’er, and then fought her with the Goddess of Light. Hence, he was only affected by the power of the rebound, while Wang Qiu’er had to contend with the strength of the Goddess of Light as well. Furthermore, she also had to deal with the coldness of Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice. She retreated quickly, and only steadied herself near the edge of the battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er had improved, but so had Huo Yuhao. His greatest advantage lay in the fact that he had more soul skills than an ordinary soul master. Hence, with more soul skills, he had more options as he fought. The main problem he faced was how he should combine his soul skills. As he gained more experience, he became more confident in his own mastery of his various powers. To him, all he had to ensure while he unleashed his soul skills was that he had enough soul power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His spiritual power had also continued to increase, which allowed Huo Yuhao to be more precise as he used his soul power to activate his soul skills. This reduced soul power wastage, just like his Ice Empress’ Wrath just now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Goddess of Light touched Wang Qiu’er, he was able to stop Ice Empress’ Wrath with his strong controlling abilities. He did not unleash the full strength of this attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An immense soul power tore through the air, and Wang Qiu’er did not wait for it to stop. She raised her right leg and stepped on the edge of this strange world. Then, she pushed herself forward as her Golden Dragon Spear dazzled with light. She charged straight toward Huo Yuhao. This time, she was strengthened by her first and second soul skills. In terms of strength, she was much stronger and faster than before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not realistic to try and hide in such a small space. Huo Yuhao did not try that. A deep-blue figure appeared behind him and instantly grew larger. Her expression was icy-cold, and she wielded absolute power over ice and snow. It was the Snow Empress.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress’ figure entered Huo Yuhao’s body instantly. He raised his right arm, and a dark-blue sword light formed, which turned into a shockingly long ray of light that slashed down vertically. The spear light, which encompassed a wide area, appeared insignificant next to this. Looking at its shape, it seemed capable of splitting heaven and earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unparalleled Chill, Empress’ Sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the most powerful sword from the perfect fusion of Huo Yuhao and the Snow Empress.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vast amount of spear light was concentrated into one stalk. It tapped the edge of the deep-blue light, and a faint ‘ding’ could be heard. Then, the deep-blue Empress’ Sword bounced into the air and disappeared into nothing. However, the Golden Dragon Spear stopped too. A deep-blue light started to spread from the tip of the spear. It crept halfway down the spear before it was forcibly stopped by the golden-yellow light. However, Wang Qiu’er, who gripped the spear tightly, appeared to be covered by a layer of ice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Ultimate Ice had become even purer! Wang Qiu’er could sense her entire body freezing up. She could not help but gasp in shock. She had never expected Huo Yuhao to fight her head-on. Could he really pull it off?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Huo Yuhao, who had been on the defensive since the start of the battle, started to go on the offensive. Light shone from his back once more and, propelled by his soul thruster, he soon appeared in front of Wang Qiu’er. An odd scene appeared. The armor of his human-shaped soul tool above his hand opened, and his bare palm was revealed. He pushed out with this palm and hit Wang Qiu’er’s right shoulder. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she saw Huo Yuhao’s palm, which shone with an odd deep-blue light, Wang Qiu’er’s face soured. Despite her fierce fighting style, she did not dare to come into contact with Huo Yuhao. Her body flashed and, pivoting on her Golden Dragon Spear, she swiftly retreated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was familiar with her powers, so how could she not be familiar with his? When he struck with his left hand, this was evidently Huo Yuhao’s most powerful Snowless Glacier.&nbsp;</span></p>

Had it been anyone else, she would have taken the blow and counter-attacked. But once this coldness entered her body, it would be game over for her.&nbsp;</span></p>

He struck out with his left palm once more, and then switched to his right fist, which was armor-clad. A golden light flashed, and Goddess of Light appeared behind Huo Yuhao once more. Undoubtedly, this punch was imbued with the power of his ability.&nbsp;</span></p>

Now, as he attacked relentlessly, she became even more enraged. A dragon roar resonated in the air as she raised her hands. Her left hand struck Huo Yuhao’s right fist, while she tried to grab Huo Yuhao’s head with her right hand.&nbsp;</span></p>

To him, this was the best chance to unleash that powerful attack. As his spiritual power increased, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock became more powerful as well. Wang Qiu’er was confident that she could take it, but if she did, her body would surely be injured. Furthermore, once she was injured, she would move much slower. Hence, as she struck, she first tried to take care of Huo Yuhao’s head by using her immense aura to suppress him.&nbsp;</span></p>

At the very least, she would not be at a disadvantage.</span></p>
