 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he became stronger, some of the things that he had to be extremely careful with before could now be treated with less caution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a faint glow flashed on his body, Huo Yuhao projected an ice-cold beam from his face. While he was flying, he had already unleashed his spiritual detection ability to search for the Sun Moon Empire’s surveillance soul tools, which were hiding somewhere in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The current surveillance soul tool setup used by the Sun Moon Empire was very different from the one they had used previously. These soul tools were completely separated and spaced out. Even though they were able to cover a huge range, their arrangement was not in an extremely predictable pattern. In fact, the Sun Moon Empire had employed a dual surveillance method by performing surveillance from both the land and the air. The overlapping of their surveillance range would increase the chances of detecting enemy movement and guaranteed better safety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almost every surveillance soul tool was protected by a soul tool on the land, and the aerial surveillance soul tools were also acting as a radar for the soul tools on the ground. Hence, it could be said that they were highly complementary, and would help improve their security to a huge extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nowadays, there were linked soul tools wherever soul tools were stationed in the Sun Moon Empire. These linked soul tools could perform both offensive and defensive operations. When it came to their offensive capabilities, they could kill a Titled Douluo in a split second. This was why linked soul tools were extremely scary. Because of their overwhelming power, even the powerful Body Sect could not stop the advance of the Sun Moon Empire</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because the Sun Moon Empire had stepped up their security at the Ming Dou Mountain Range, neither the White Tiger Duke nor Princess Jiujiu could do anything to the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If a large army were to attempt to penetrate these lines of soul tools, they would still be able to do so. Nonetheless, they would have to deal with large numbers of casualties. In addition, they would not know what kind of security would be stationed in an ambush position due to the impossibility of doing any form of reconnaissance. Falling into an ambush after sustaining heavy losses from penetrating the thick lines of soul tools would be a cost even the Star Luo Empire could not undertake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, the White Tiger Duke opted to defend the Ming Dou Mountain Range instead of taking the risk to attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual detection was ultimately limited, and could only detect a large party of troops. He could not get a complete picture of all the troops near the perimeter of the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, this would not affect his mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao would not be foolish enough to attack those aerial surveillance tools. He would simply become a target for the soul tools lined up beneath him. In fact, they would not even have to take aim at him. They simply had to shoot upwards into the sky, and he would be in an extremely precarious position. One must remember that Huo Yuhao was not fighting alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After going around the Sun Moon Empire’s surveillance tools, Huo Yuhao flew straight into the Sun Moon Empire. He went straight to the nearest station where the Sun Moon Empire had set up a series of soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He went up to them in an extremely delicate fashion before circling to the back of the area. He took a moment to use his spiritual detection to analyze the landscape of this station before finding a gap to get closer to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From his spiritual detection, Huo Yuhao was able to tell that this station had over a hundred offensive soul tools and several types of soul tools which could help with surveillance, defense, and auxiliary work. Outside of the station, there were five thousand normal soldiers who were tasked with defending this soul tool formation. The interior of the station was primarily manned by a few soul engineers. Their numbers were not very large—just over a hundred people. It was apparent that the soul tools were running on sealed milk bottles. The soul engineers simply had to control their daily consumption. After all, the most demanding soul tools were the offensive and defensive ones, and they did not have to be operated that often.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After surveying the surroundings of this station, Huo Yuhao silently crept away and retreated to a blind spot where the Sun Moon Empire’s surveillance soul tools would not be able to detect him. He chanted a few incantations and opened his spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering the demiplane, Huo Yuhao met up with his companions and shared his plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening to his plan, all of them agreed to it, and the nine black doors soon opened in an inconspicuous forest, and the heavy artillery started to roll out. Yes, it was none other than Huo Yuhao’s Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three hundred Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons were able to line up in an organized fashion very quickly as they waited for orders to be issued. It was only now that they realized they had already arrived at the Sun Moon Empire in such a short amount of time. They were feeling both excited and amazed by this revelation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The higher-ups of the Tang Sect also emerged from the spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong naturally moved to Huo Yuhao’s side. Huo Yuhao announced, “I want everyone to get ready to attack. Eldest senior brother, Wutong and I will head over to the station where the soul tools are. After sabotaging them, we will immediately return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded and said, “Alright. Take care.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao held Tang Wutong’s hand as he activated Imitation. He started to creep towards the place where the soul tools were stationed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul tools stationed in that area were in fact very sensitive. However, their surveillance ability was limited to a certain range. To put it simply, their surveillance was useless on soldiers outside those ranges, Hence, those surveillance soul tools were primarily used to keep watch on movement in the sky. When it came to watching the ground, that was the responsibility of the aerial surveillance soul tools.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power evolved again, oscillation detectors were no longer useful against him. He could use his spiritual power to detect any oscillation waves that were headed in his direction. He was also able to use his Ultimate Ice to change the temperature around him to avoid detection by thermal detectors. Hence, it was extremely hard for any soul tools to detect him. He was only vulnerable to the extremely rare spiritual power detectors and soul power detectors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two detectors were extremely limited, as they could only detect fluctuations within an extremely short range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong could enter the camp of the normal soldiers without being detected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, it was the middle of the afternoon. After lunch, the five thousand soldiers were taking their afternoon breaks. The lives of soldiers tended to be a lot more relaxed when they were not in the middle of a war. Their routine usually included some training in the morning, breaks in the afternoon and patrols in the evening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they went through the camp, they started to get closer to the place where the soul tools were stationed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, what should we do now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “There are only about a hundred soul engineers inside. The strongest one is but a seven-ringed Soul Sage. I believe he has yet to attain the level of a Class 7 soul engineer. Nonetheless, this area is enveloped by surveillance from soul power detectors and spiritual power detectors. The soul engineers in this area must be carrying some sort of pass which allows them to roam around without being mistaken as an enemy. We would probably get found out the moment we stepped into the area. However, the soul tools in this area seem to be heavy weapons. Even though they might be very destructive and can activate the powers of linked soul tools, they probably won’t be able to unleash their powers within the area.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong immediately caught what Huo Yuhao was hinting at. “We are going to rush in?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao flashed her a smile. “What are we waiting for? Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished his sentence, Huo Yuhao grabbed Tang Wutong’s hand and dashed into the area like a lightning bolt. His eyes turned brilliant golden the moment he stepped into the area where the soul tools were stationed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao might have twin martial souls and an Ultimate Strength martial soul, but the most frightening thing about him was not his fighting power. It was his invincible reconnaissance ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though there were plenty of surveillance soul tools and even some spiritual power detectors within the area, they were unable to stop Huo Yuhao’s ability from scanning the entire camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately grasped the locations of all the different soul engineers within this area. This information would be extremely helpful for his subsequent actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The place that Huo Yuhao had chosen to enter first was the resting area for the soul engineers who were in charge of protecting and controlling the soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The resting area was placed in the center of the camp in order to protect them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao dashed straight towards the center of the camp with both of his eyes shining with a golden color.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The daily maintenance and surveillance work for the area did not require many people. It was only during war when they required everyone to be working at any point in time. Hence, most of the soul engineers were congregated at the resting area. That was why Huo Yuhao chose to strike this area first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very instant when he stepped into the camp, a mysterious spiritual ripple spread out from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was immediately detected by the spiritual power detectors as the alarm within the camp went off. However, this would not be sufficient to stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao activated his Eye of Destiny as his spiritual power was increased to its maximum. At this very instant, the entire resting area was within his control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the saying went, a commander must not go easy on the enemy’s soldiers. As the Chief Commander of Shrek City’s three Soul Engineer Legions, he had to be responsible for the safety of his troops, and more importantly, the hope and future of three Empires. Hence, he must not be merciful against these soul engineers!</span></p>
