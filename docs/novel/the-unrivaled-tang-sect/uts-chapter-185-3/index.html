Furthermore, these evil soul masters were certain to cause widespread civilian deaths the moment they acted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Huo Yuhao and Fan Yu were discussing this matter, a muffled thump came from afar. It was the sound of He Caitou’s stationary soul tool going off. No traces of the ‘dirty’ Holy Ghost Church’s Sub-Altar would be left over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had benefited greatly from this experience. Besides earning the loyalty of Na Na and the Holy Servants, he had also managed to obtain the black skull from the Second Holy Ghost. This black skull would be pretty useful in fights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The undead aura from the black skull had been completely purified by Huo Yuhao after he returned. He preserved the Second Holy Ghost’s resolute defense and controlled it through his spirit after purification. Huo Yuhao even made it seem a little divine. Huo Yuhao left a shred of his spiritual aura within the black skull’s spiritual fire so he could control it with his thoughts. Although it couldn’t unleash any skills, it was still a powerful assistive force that could match up to a Soul Emperor in a fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Second Holy Ghost was completely under Huo Yuhao’s control now. Huo Yuhao didn’t feel bad at all using him as a secret weapon, considering the evil acts that the Holy Ghost Church had committed. He had used others, and was now being used heartlessly himself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

Shrek’s Guardians acted immediately. They started to seek out the Holy Ghost Church throughout the continent, especially in the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Church hid well. No trace of them could be found. This Church didn’t seem to even exist at all, as if they had vanished into thin air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy was very peaceful after the destruction of the Holy Ghost Church’s Sub-Altar, or at least that was what it seemed like on the surface. Huo Yuhao and He Caitou observed things around them, but didn’t notice anything amiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei passed them news that Na Na and the rest had arrived safely, and had joined the Tang Sect. They became the first batch of disciples of the Tang Sect, apart from the Shrek’s Seven Monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

Huo Yuhao was now almost at the end of his second academic year in the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. More accurately speaking, he had been here for more than a year and nine months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was one thing that was similar between the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy and Shrek Academy. Vacation time! They started a little later here compared to Shrek Academy, but it also lasted for a month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was in deep meditation during this last break. He finally had some time off this academic year. Of course, he didn’t plan on resting. He came here to learn; he didn’t want to waste any time. There were very few in the academy who had the same mindset as him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had raised his profile extremely high during the sparring competition, but his studies continued smoothly after he went through half a year of deep meditation, &nbsp;and kept a low-profile afterward. Huo Yuhao worked hard to learn about soul tools. As he cultivated, he researched the profundity of soul tools. He spent his days fruitfully, even though they were mundane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the days passed, Huo Yuhao also matured physically. He was now seventeen years old, and his body was very developed now. He wasn’t especially burly, but he had a build that was filled with vigor and vitality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was very difficult to imagine a seventeen-year-old youth possessing a demeanor as calm and composed demeanor as him. This was greatly connected to his cultivation of the Sovereign's Descent. He also tried to keep the look in his eyes moderated under normal circumstances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His cultivation speed had increased after his spiritual power nourished his body in deep meditation. He managed to reach Rank 43, and his cultivation speed seemed to increase along with his abilities. This was extremely good news for Huo Yuhao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he didn’t manage to become a five-ringed Soul King. Jing Hongchen was relieved after hearing this. After all, the three years between the ages of fifteen and eighteen were very important for a genius soul master. These three years were critical in establishing his foundation. Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen had relayed news that their cultivations had reached Rank 60, becoming Soul Emperors. They were also Class 6 soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Hongchen admired Huo Yuhao’s fighting capabilities. He had even beaten a six-ringed Soul Emperor, even though he only had four rings. However, a Soul Emperor was a Soul Emperor. If everyone had the same talent, a six-ringed Soul Emperor would completely dominate a four-ringed Soul Ancestor. Jing Hongchen didn’t believe that Huo Yuhao could challenge his grandchildren. The potential of a genius would fall as time passed. If Huo Yuhao couldn’t reach Rank 60 before he was twenty years old, Jing Hongchen wouldn’t call him a genius anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Second senior, why are you here?” Huo Yuhao opened the door and looked at the excited He Caitou standing outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou wore a mysterious look on his face. “Little junior, I have a surprise for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Surprise? For me? What new stationary soul tool have you successfully researched?” Huo Yuhao looked back at him in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou snapped, “Oh no, oh no! You’re getting dumb. Your life is only about the dormitory and Illustrious Virtue Hall. Aren’t you tired? You should relax when it’s time to do so. You’ll feel better then. You’re always so tense, which is not a good thing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was slightly moved, as he had heard something similar from someone else before. It wasn’t his first time. As he thought of that person, there was a slight change in the look in his eyes. Ever since he came to the Sun Moon Empire, he had received letters from eldest senior and others of his compatriots. However, the person who was supposed to be sending him letters didn’t write any for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong, how are you?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Huo Yuhao was a little down as he thought of Wang Dong.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Surely he hasn’t forgotten me after so long?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, little junior, I’m talking to you. Focus.” He Caitou was displeased as he shook Huo Yuhao’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao hurriedly invited him in. He softly said, “Have you made progress on the Holy Ghost Church’s matter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou rolled his eyes and didn’t even bother entering the room. He stood at the door, and his towering figure made him seem like some sort of guardian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That bullshit organization has gone missing. I wonder if you were hallucinating. Otherwise, they’re covering themselves very well. Alright, follow me. Let’s go to the gate for a moment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll skip that. I’m busy with my formation array, and I’m at a critical point. I’m about to finish.” Huo Yuhao declined He Caitou’s proposition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou was furious. “Have my words fallen on deaf ears? Quick, you’ll regret it if you don’t go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, He Caitou dragged Huo Yuhao out and forcefully ran him away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was slightly annoyed, but he couldn’t bear to reject He Caitou’s good intentions. He naturally believed that his second senior wouldn’t harm him. However, he wasn’t in any sort of mood to receive any surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t reckon that there would be any surprises for him, apart from achieving a breakthrough in his cultivation. This was the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, not Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, Huo Yuhao was dragged to a vast field by He Caitou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Second senior, you don’t have to drag me. I’ll follow you.” Huo Yuhao had no choice but to compromise.</span></p>

He said, “Don’t force it, either. I think it’s better if you don’t go. If you regret it, don’t blame me.” As he spoke, he released Huo Yuhao’s hand and turned away.</span></p>

I’ll follow you. You’re right, I should change my brain. Otherwise, it’ll become a formation array.”</span></p>

I just find it regretful for someone else.”</span></p>

Ji Juechen was beside her.</span></p>

He glanced at He Caitou and seemed to be asking him something.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Second senior, surely this isn’t the surprise you have for me?</span></p>

The two of them were always together. When they had nothing to do, they would come and approach Huo Yuhao to spar.</span></p>

However, they went overboard. How could Huo Yuhao not be vexed? Neither of them cared about where they were. There were a few occasions when they disrupted him just as he had some inspiration on figuring out how to create formation arrays.</span></p>

He gave Ji Juechen and Jing Ziyan a good whacking, as they didn’t use any other soul skills or tap into their soul power to repress him.</span></p>

However, they returned not long after. Ji Juechen even told Huo Yuhao that his understanding of sword intent became deeper after he was whacked by him!</span></p>
