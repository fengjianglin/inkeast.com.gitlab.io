 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao’s expressions changed when Huo Yuhao talked about the corpse explosion that had happened back then. An evil soul master who was only a Soul King managed to exterminate almost all of Team Shrek’s official team members. Even Ma Xiaotao and Dai Yueheng were heavily injured. In the tournament, they witnessed how powerful these 2 soul emperors were! They even possessed soul bones. They only thought that evil soul masters were too frightening then, but didn’t realize that Huo Yuhao possess a similar ability too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Explosion Technique and corpse explosion were very similar, but they were also different in their own ways. Corpse explosion was a direct explosion of a corpse, but it required the injection of a poison. The Envoy of the Death God had injected the poison in the cave then, and all the corpses were infected with the poison. They were then induced to explode. The timing of the explosion couldn’t be controlled. The Ice Explosion Technique was advanced in this aspect. Not only was the timing of the explosion controllable, but it could even be used as long as the opponent was frozen. That’s why the Ice Explosion Technique was highly regarded in the Starlight auction house after it appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, one couldn’t bear the Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone’s intensity without Ultimate Ice due to the domineering Ice Explosion Technique. That’s why this soul bone eventually landed in Huo Yuhao’s hands. This was his first time using it, but its power was beyond what he had expected. The explosive force of a ten thousand year soul beast could rival Ma Xiaotao’s strongest attack, and might even be superior to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you trying to scare me to death?!” Elder Xuan’s voice rang out at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had been observing the 3 of them. From afar, he became more relaxed after he saw the 3 of them retreating into the forest and concealing themselves well using Imitation. But he didn’t expect an explosion to happen so suddenly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan’s heart almost jumped out of his mouth when the Ice Explosion rang out. He was extremely sensitive now after the last lesson. Furthermore, he was well-aware of what the 3 of them meant to the academy. They all had twin martial souls!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s why he rushed over instantly. After he saw the three of them who appeared dejected and heard Huo Yuhao’s description of the Ice Explosion, he revealed himself and vented his frustration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Xuan.” The three of them greeted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan lifted his hand and smashed his wine gourd on Huo Yuhao’s head. Huo Yuhao spat out his tongue as his head was struck. “Rascal, be careful of playing with fire. No, playing with ice and causing harm to yourself. If something happens to you, how I can account to Elder Mu? You didn’t even try it before you used such an uncontrollable soul skill. What if all of you were blown apart because you were too close? Don’t tell me you can control the explosive force.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a little indignant as he retorted, “But I can’t find a ten thousand year soul beast in the academy to try this on.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uhhh…” That was true, as Shrek Academy did have ten thousand year soul beasts. But they were valuable resources, and couldn’t be used for experiments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The radiance in Elder Xuan’s eyes flashed, and he looked to the other side of the area that had exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A burly figure wobbled out. This figure took unsteady steps, as if it could collapse at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a huge bear that was huge and tall, but had suffered many injuries. The fur of this huge bear was dark gold, but it was stained with a large amount of dark red blood now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of its front limbs had already disappeared, including the shoulder blade. It was bleeding from many places, and its eyes flashed with a dim green light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side of its body, its claws were extremely long as they reached more than 2 feet in length. It was still bursting with energy although it was covered entirely in blood as it wobbled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s the bear from just now.” Xiao Xiao said &nbsp;in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Huo Yuhao explained the Ice Explosion Technique, they reckoned that the bear must have been blown to pieces. After all, Huo Yuhao was unaware of the Ice Explosion Technique’s might beforehand. It was not abnormal to make such a mistake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they hadn’t expected that the huge bear would survive the explosion, and only be sent flying by the explosive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them could sense the aura of death even at the borders of the area that had exploded. Their ears were still ringing now. And the huge bear had borne the explosion right at the center of it! But only one of its limbs had been blown apart, and it hadn’t died yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How strong was its defense to survive such a blast? No wonder it wasn’t afraid of a ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat with its thousand year cultivation. This was the difference in species. It was just like how the youngest giant dragon was stronger than the most powerful lizard. This huge bear possessed a shocking strength indeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them were certain that they couldn’t beat this bear even if they teamed up together. Their offense was unlikely to overcome the defense of this bear. Unless Huo Yuhao could freeze its body and use the Ice Explosion Technique, they didn’t have any chance at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, a Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear. Why would this soul beast appear around the perimeter of Star Dou Forest?” The bear looked extremely pathetic right now. In addition, the three of them couldn’t identify it because it was very rare. But Elder Xuan was very experienced, and could identify it easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ‘Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears’; a soul beast with the title ‘Earth Render.’ They were the greatest of the most powerful soul beasts, and were belligerents in the Star Dou Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Huo Yuhao returned to Shrek Academy, he had specially researched the Ten Great Savage Beasts. He seemed to recall the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear being one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soul beasts generally specialized in certain traits. For example, they could be very speedy, offensively or defensively inclined, etc. The Deviltiger Cat, for example specialized in speed. Its offensive strength relied on its extreme speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear was an anomaly. Its specialty was offense and defense, which was conflicting. Its dark golden fur contained powerful defensive strength, while its pair of frightening claws was frightening offensively. The Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear was even rumored to be able to challenge a giant dragon. It was very uncommon for a Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear to appear in the perimeter of Star Dou Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear was critically injured, it still maintained its sensitive hearing. It heard Elder Xuan’s voice, and released a furious roar that sounded very threatening. But it stopped in its tracks. It didn’t continue to advance forward. The painful lesson that it had received earlier had left it extremely wary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan revealed a slight smile on his face and said, “Fortunately, I wasn’t scared for nothing. Your luck is pretty good. Not only is this fellow suitable, but it’s even beyond my expectations. Let me do it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t dare to let the three of them face the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear. It possessed frightening offensive ability. The three of them would definitely be killed if they were struck by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan arrived in front of the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear as his figure flashed. The Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear reacted very quickly. It still managed to attack and mount its own defense even though it was critically injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A layer of dark golden flowing light surged out from its undamaged fur. This layer of light didn’t stick to its fur, but remained slightly above it. Its fur started to stand up like needles. At the same time, it waved its claw and clawed towards Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its 2 foot claw already seemed very exaggerated. But the three of them understood the true meaning of a terrorclaw when it waved its claw. Its claw tripled in size, growing to 2 meters in length. Its sharp claw flashed with a dark golden radiance as it clawed towards Elder Xuan. Even a mountain rock would be split into pieces if it were struck by this claw, let alone a human!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it’s a pity that it was facing Elder Xuan. Even a top-ranked Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear might not fancy meeting Elder Xuan, while this bear only had a thousand year cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan straightened his expression, and a yellow radiance flashed before disappearing. The thousand year Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s body remained still without moving. It was clear that its lower limbs had sunk into the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan rose up and slapped his palm on the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s head. The Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s bones were shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Xiao, come over!” Elder Xuan shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao knew what Elder Xuan wanted her to do. She rushed over to Elder Xuan’s side. Elder Xuan gave her a sharp blade and plucked out a patch of dark gold fur from the back of the bear’s neck. Xiao Xiao expended some effort before she managed to stab the blade into the bear’s neck. She pierced the nerves of the bear’s central nervous system, which caused it to die.</span></p>
