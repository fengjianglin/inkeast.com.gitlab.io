 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering the Academy, Huo Yuhao and Bei Bei slowed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Bei Bei was a little puzzled as he asked, “Yuhao, what’s going on between you and Wutong? Why did she leave without saying a word after sending you back that day?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was helpless as he replied, “I don’t know either! We faced danger then. She must have saved me. Perhaps she was hurt or too tired, and she rushed back to the Academy to rest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t dare tell Bei Bei that he took nine stabs for Tang Wutong. If he did, he didn’t know how Bei Bei would admonish him. He wasn’t afraid of anyone but Bei Bei. It was like facing Dai Luoli. He had always considered Bei Bei like his own biological elder brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said, “Since she saved you, you should go and visit her after we report to Elder Xuan. This time, Wutong has really treated you well by going so far to save you. I can tell that she likes you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao revealed a bitter smile on his face. However, he didn’t outright reject Bei Bei. He only nodded slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei brought him as the two of them went to Sea God’s Island. They rushed straight to Sea God’s Pavilion under Bei Bei’s lead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they were outside the pavilion, Huo Yuhao stopped in front of the Golden Tree before kowtowing. Bei Bei did the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao thought to himself,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Teacher, I’m back alive. I faced Long Xiaoyao this time, but I don’t know why he let me off. Is it because of you? Or something else? Why did my cultivation improve after I took the nine stabs? And why aren’t there any wounds on my body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regarding this mystery, he could only ask Tang Wutong later on. However, he could roughly remember that Tang Wutong had fainted before he completely lost consciousness.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How would she know anything, if that’s the case? It would probably be too difficult for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed helplessly as he finished thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you sighing? Both of you, come in” Elder Xuan’s voice came from the Sea God’s Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Bei Bei stood up and walked into the pavilion. Among the younger generation, only the two of them and Zhang Lexuan could enter and leave the Sea God’s Pavilion freely. That was because they were all members of the Sea God’s Pavilion. Without a doubt, they were going to be the leading figures of Shrek Academy in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan was already waiting for them on the first level. He looked at Huo Yuhao and said, “Yuhao, why do you create a different problem every time you leave? You’re a problem magnet indeed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao tensed up.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Don’t tell me that Wutong has already told Elder Xuan about our meeting with the Darkness Holy Dragon? Elder senior will still scold me if Elder Xuan blurts it out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he had no other choice, since things were already at this stage. He only thickened his skin and laughed, “Elder Xuan, I don’t know whether I’m fortunate or not. However, I did earn some merit this time! Even if I was wrong in some way, I should be able to make amends for it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan nodded and answered, “You did make a mistake, which is to cause trouble for me. However, you did well in the Extreme North. Tell me, how did you spoil the Sun Moon Empire’s plans? Logically speaking, you couldn’t deal with an entire soul engineer legion on your own. Qiuqiu’s words were also very ambiguous. She also doesn’t know what you did.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hup Yuhao coughed. “It’s like that. Elder Xuan, I’ve got some things to report to you. In fact, do you still remember the Spirit that I have?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan thought for a moment before asking, “Are you talking about that young lady? The cute one?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded hurriedly and answered, “Yes, her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course I do. How could I not remember such a cute young lady? Why? What has she got to do with this?” Elder Xuan was puzzled. Even Bei Bei was curious. Even though he all along knew that Huo Yuhao’s strength was a little mysterious, this had to do with Huo Yuhao’s own privacy. If Yuhao didn’t say anything, he wouldn’t ask. But right now, his curiosity was piqued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chuckled and said, “She isn’t some young girl. Talking about her background, it’s actually quite impressive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He recounted how he came upon the embryo of the Snow Empress when he was in the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, as well as how he had fused with her. He also talked about how the Snow Empress had created a Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his story, Elder Xuan and Bei Bei were in awe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The things that happened to Huo Yuhao couldn’t be adequately described by the word ‘magical’ anymore. A human had actually fused with the Snow Empress, ranked third among the Ten Great Savage Beasts. The Snow Empress was only inferior to Di Tian and the Evileye Tyrant King, &nbsp;her cultivation around seven hundred thousand years!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Snow Empress was at her peak, even if Mu En were still alive, he might not even be able to fight her. If it was in the ice plains of the Extreme North, the Snow Empress could even fight the Beast God! Such a supernatural being had actually become Huo Yuhao’s Spirit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder this kid’s Ultimate Ice abilities rose so quickly. Ultimate Ice is such a difficult ability to cultivate, but he was able to become a Soul Sage just like Bei Bei and the rest. So this is why!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I led the Snow Empress to the core of the Extreme North. Under her command, the strongest species of soul beasts in the Extreme North, the Tai Tan Snowdevils, agreed to help me. I came up with a simple plan to destroy the base and facilities that the Sun Moon Empire’s military had set up. Given the harsh conditions, they couldn’t survive without their facilities, and could only retreat. Believe me, with the threat of those soul beasts, and given the Sun Moon Empire is so far away, they won’t be able to do anything in the short-term.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan’s lips twisted after he heard Huo Yuhao’s story. He said, “That works? You’re actually able to tap into the power of the soul beasts in the Extreme North. It’s really…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe.” Huo Yuhao chuckled. He was blowing his horn a bit, but he was also a little proud of himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan glared at him and said, “Don’t be too happy. Don’t be so reckless when you face something like that in the future. Can’t you at least send news back to the Academy and wait for reinforcements first? Do you really not trust us at all?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Elder Xuan was admonishing Huo Yuhao, Huo Yuhao still felt very warm in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! Shrek Academy is just like my home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I was wrong, Elder Xuan. I’ll keep that in mind in the future,” Huo Yuhao admitted his mistake very obediently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan wanted to scold him further, but he stopped upon seeing that Huo Yuhao was so repentant. After all, he was already a grown-up. He couldn’t help but laugh, “You are eager to admit your mistakes, but you won’t change your character.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao scratched his head in embarrassment, while Bei Bei nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao quickly changed the topic and said, “Elder Xuan, both of us are here to tell you about Teacher Xiao Ya. We caught an evil soul master when we went to Heaven Dou City. We managed to find out that she’s at the front lines.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was secretly relieved when he said that. Elder Xuan didn’t seem to know about him and Tang Wutong. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be let off so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was anxious, and rushed to tell Elder Xuan about what Chu Yanwei had revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan pondered for a moment. “Since that’s the case, form a team in the Tang Sect. I’ll think about who I should send with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was evidently a little stunned. He probed, “Elder Xuan, we’re going to save Xiao Ya. Will it affect the Academy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan glanced at him. “I understand what you’re worried about. Don’t tell me that the Sun Moon Empire doesn’t know that we’re going to deal with them? Not only do we have to succeed in saving her this time, but we must also do something useful. This will boost confidence in the three empires of the original Douluo Continent. At the same time, we’ll bring the Sun Moon Empire back to the ground. We must think of a way to confuse them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei’s eyes brightened, and he said, “Elder Xuan is wise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan snapped, “Stop bootlicking. Tell me then, how am I wise?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uh… Elder Xuan, I’m a little confused. Come, Yuhao, tell him.” As he spoke, he dragged Huo Yuhao over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eldest senior, you’re dishonorable!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly in his heart, but he didn’t dare to say it out loud. He thought for a moment before saying, “Elder Xuan, you’re clear in the other areas, but as for the confusion part, we just have to exclude soul engineers. We’ll use traditional soul masters from the Academy to fight. The Sun Moon Empire will still think that we’re mainly composed of soul masters. Even if our Soul Tool Department has developed, it can’t compare to our soul masters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan nodded in satisfaction and said, “That’s it. Right now, Lin’er and Duoduo are busy with the Soul Tool Department. I’ll ask Shaozhe to follow both of you instead. He can represent the Academy. However, the lessons and training in the Academy are quite tight on schedule. I can’t allocate many people to go with you. I’ll ask Elder Song to go, too. With the two of them around, there shouldn’t be any problems protecting you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Shrek Academy, Elder Song was only inferior to Elder Xuan. Her Greenshadow Godly Eagle had played a very important role during the Beast Wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With two Transcendent Douluo backing them up, their chances of success were greatly increased. Bei Bei rubbed his hands in excitement. “Thanks, Elder Xuan! Thank you!”</span></p>
