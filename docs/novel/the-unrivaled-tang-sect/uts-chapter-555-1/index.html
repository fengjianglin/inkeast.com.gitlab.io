 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This place is beautiful.” Tang Wutong couldn’t help but enthuse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chortled, “Yes! It’s beautiful. Come, let’s go down and have a look.” He held onto Tang Wutong as he flew up. This time, they didn’t land on the ground again. They relied on their soul power to maintain their altitude. They were only thirty centimeters from the ground, but refused to step on it. How could they bear to step on this Bluesilver Grass?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more they ventured into the mountain valley, the more refreshing the air became. There was even a slight flowery fragrance. Occasionally, bees and butterflies flew over to feed on nectar and pollinate flowers. It was like a paradise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, they came to the bottom of the valley. There weren’t any tall trees here, but Bluesilver Grass continued to carpet the entire valley. No soil was exposed at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes were full of bliss as he held Tang Wutong’s hand. From the environment here, it seemed like there was a huge possibility that they could find it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lights flashed in his eyes again. Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power extended downward, like water flowing down. This time, he didn’t fuse his spiritual power with the plants, but relied solely on his own spiritual power to survey his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once his spiritual power spread, the entire mountain valley was under his surveillance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Bluesilver Grasses, which was originally very calm, started to shake. Following this, patches of grass seemed to sense something. They all spiked up, as if they were pricks. The harmony was replaced by a sinister and hostile aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’re panicking.” Tang Wutong said, stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As her spiritual senses were enhanced the previous night, she was currently extremely sensitive to the aura of plants. She believed that Huo Yuhao could also sense what she sensed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao was unmoved. He was silently sensing the hostility coming from the Bluesilver Grass around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was pure hostility. The reason was simple too. This was because Huo Yuhao was snooping around. Pure Bluesilver Grass didn’t possess such an ability. The reason why they were able to react in this manner was because there was something like Huo Yuhao that was spiritually connected to them. This something was even closer to them than Huo Yuhao when he connected with plants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed. This time, he had truly verified it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strong hostility that came from the Bluesilver Grass affected his Spiritual Detection. However, Huo Yuhao didn’t seem to have any reaction to it. He maintained his composure and continued to pour out his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind him, a dim golden projection started to appear. It had the appearance of the Emperor Beast. At the same time, his Eye of Destiny also opened. The Light of Destiny gently shone. Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power also grew significantly stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hostility of the Bluesilver Grass was immediately crushed under Huo Yuhao’s immense spiritual power. It was also at this moment that Huo Yuhao lifted his head. A streak of gentle white light shot out from his Eye of Destiny. It shot through the air before turning into countless spots of white light. These spots of white light fell from the sky, resembling a light rain. This light rain covered the entire mountain valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong also basked in this rain. It was very new and comfortable for her. It was a strength that came from fortune. Even though it couldn’t change anything directly, it influenced the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Destiny’s Adjudication!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The valley rapidly quieted down. The Bluesilver Grass also turned from hard to soft. Everything seemed to turn back to normal. For these plants that could only perform the most basic of functions, their senses were simple and direct, but very acute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fortune that Huo Yuhao brought upon them and the aura of the Emperor Beast left them very excited. The hostility that had formed earlier vanished completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled. “Senior, why don’t you come out to meet me? I don’t harbor any ill intentions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Emperor Beast. You actually have the aura of the Emperor Beast. How?” A low-pitched voice sounded from afar</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s because she was my lover.” Even though Tang Wutong was around, Huo Yuhao still dared to say this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Qiu’er had sacrificed everything for him. So what if she was a soul beast? She would always own a part of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong acted like she didn’t hear that. Her expression didn’t change, and she even appeared comforted. Such a man was deserving of her love!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That voice was silent for a moment. “However, your lover has become your ability.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao also went silent. After this, he slowly landed. The Bluesilver Grass on the ground automatically swayed, and let him sit cross-legged on the ground. Tang Wutong sat down beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao let go of her hand, and there was a change in his expression. A sorrowful look surfaced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn’t willing to recall those memories. However, he had no choice if he wanted to help Teacher Xiao Ya.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He shut his eyes, and Wang Qiu’er appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That handkerchief that was blown by the wind and the ravishing beauty of the Goddess of Light started surfacing in his memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m Wang Qiu’er!” A cold voice echoed in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a low-pitched roar, which was exactly her style when she unleashed her power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her Golden Spear formed countless projections in her hand. Her immense strength helped her defeat opponent after opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her cold yet silent gaze was a representation of the warmth in her heart. Beneath her cold exterior, she was actually very passionate and emotional.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was avoiding her, but she was persistent and reluctant. Everything that happened in the past – every scene, every matter, and every item – surfaced in Huo Yuhao’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only at the end, when she burned herself without any hesitation for him and turned into an intense sacrificial flame, that he realized that he had been wrong. Actually, she was already part of his heart, no matter how much he didn’t want to admit it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was heartbroken, completely heartbroken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After her sacrifice, he had not attempted to recall what had happened then. This was because he was afraid. He was really afraid. He was afraid of such pain. Right now, he found it very stifling and difficult to breathe when he was struck by this excruciating pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tears had long since covered his face. His entire body was shaking tremendously, and dim golden lights rippled in the air. His sorrow affected the Bluesilver Grass and flowers around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They drooped down as if they had withered. They mourned along with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dim golden projection slowly became real behind him. The projection walked in front of him and raised a paw, wanting to touch him. However, she didn’t do so in the end. She only lowered her head, and her eyes were filled with sorrow and reluctance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a thin white palm stretched over, grabbing its front paw. The Three-Eyed Golden Lion lifted its head in astonishment, and all she saw was a sincere-looking face. There was a very sad and melancholic look on this face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Three-Eyed Golden Lion nodded at her. The look in its eyes also became much gentler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As golden light flashed, the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s projection fused into Tang Wutong’s body. Tang Wutong shook a little before she opened her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gentle call jolted Huo Yuhao to his senses. He was now covered in tears as he slowly opened his eyes.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qiu’er, I’m sorry.” Huo Yuhao sobbed.</span></p>

It was slender and long. As it pulled at him, Huo Yuhao was lifted from the ground.</span></p>

He saw a pair of cold eyes. It was a familiar coldness, and a familiar face. There was also a sense of warmth contained within that coldness.</span></p>

His excruciating pain immediately turned into a wave of emotions. He opened his arms and hugged her tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiu’er, she was Qiu’er.</span></p>

What replaced it was satisfaction. It was satisfaction that came from her heart.</span></p>

They hugged tightly just like that. The pain that Huo Yuhao felt in his heart gradually vanished amidst this gentleness. He also radiated more vigor now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qiu’er, is this really you?” Huo Yuhao asked softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, it’s me.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are no buts. When I made this choice, I thought that it was the best for us. I fused into your body and became a part of you. No force can separate us anymore. This is what I wanted! Furthermore, the power of my soul and origin fused into the sleeping Dong’er, under the control of the power of destiny. This is why she has both mine and Dong’er’s abilities, now that she has recovered her memories. She’s a fusion of Dong’er and myself. My soul is in your body, and my abilities are with her. That’s why I’ve never really left you!”</span></p>
