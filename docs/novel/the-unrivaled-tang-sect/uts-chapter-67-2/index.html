 <p><strong>Book 10: Shrek's Seven Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 67.2: Ultimate Transformation! Attribute Amplification!</strong></p>
 <p>Ling Luochen’s third soul ring instantly lit up as she pointed her icy staff forward, which caused an icy-blue ray of light to strike the top of Ma Xiaotao’s head.</p>
 <p>The blue light enveloped her and instantly entrapped her within an icy prison . Ma Xiaotao’s charge immediately halted her charge and her fiercely struck the icy prison with her phoenix flames.</p>
 <p>However, the icy prison didn’t shatter like she’d expected it too; only a few cracks had appeared. Ma Xiaotao’s fiery flames had been completely suppressed by this icy prison.</p>
 <p>Of the seven within the official team, Ma Xiaotao didn’t just have a bad relationship with Dai Yueheng. Her relationship with Ling Luochen wasn’t good either. She was of the fire element, while Ling Luochen was of the ice element. As such, their dispositions naturally clashed with each other. In the past, Ling Luochen had refused to help Ma Xiaotao suppress her evil fire. If she hadn’t, she wouldn’t have had to stoop to finding Xu Sanshi.</p>
 <p>However, Ma Xiaotao had always suppressed Ling Luochen in terms of pure cultivation; she definitely didn’t want to lose against her this time around.</p>
 <p>Opportunities on the battlefield were both transient and fleeting; a single moment’s opportunity could change the entire situation of a battle.</p>
 <p>Dai Yueheng had originally planned to fight Ma Xiaotao in a direct confrontation. However, the moment that Ling Luochen had made her move he’d been able to figure out who her target was due to Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection. His body suddenly flickered, and his first, third, and fifth soul rings once again lit up. This brought him to the peak of his abilities, and in an instant, he found Bei Bei.</p>
 <p>With the assistance of Gong Yangmo’s Rainbow Dragon, Bei Bei was able to block three of Dai Yueheng’s blows. However, he still retreated step by step as blood dripped from his mouth and nose. At the same time, Gong Yangmo was doing his best to protect himself from the White Tiger’s Meteor Shower. As a result, he wasn’t able to assist Ma Xiaotao. On the other hand, Jiang Nannan and He Caitou only choice was to exhaust their abilities in order to protect themselves from the White Tiger’s Meteor Shower. Their originally orderly formation had crumbled in an instant.</p>
 <p>With a flash of blue light, Yao Haoxuan—who’d just swallowed a meteor from the White Tiger’s Meteor Shower and spat it out to help Gong Yangmo—was suddenly trapped in another icy prison. At that moment, Ma Xiaotao finally broke through the icy prison that had entrapped her. However, Ling Luochen’s attack arrived at the same instant that she broke free.</p>
 <p>She pointed her icy staff forwards and her ink-like fifth soul ring lit up. A dark-blue ring of ice then floated outwards, the extreme cold it emanated covering the entire Assessment Area in a layer of frost. Ma Xiaotao’s evil fire was then subsequently suppressed to the point where it could only actually appear in a two meter diameter around her.</p>
 <p>On the other side of the battlefield, Xi Xi continued to attack Xu Sanshi wildly. However, even though she was quick, her attacks weren’t very strong. On the other hand, the Soul Ancestor-ranked Xu Sanshi was essentially a well-guarded fortress. He relied on the accurate predictive capabilities of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection to defend Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong, and Xiao Xiao in a timely manner using his Shield of the Xuanwu Turtle.</p>
 <p>Ling Luochen’s dark-blue ring of ice continued to slowly rise, while the bluish light on it circulated and released three blue pillars of light that shot towards Ma Xiaotao, Gong Yangmo, and Yao Haoxuan respectively.</p>
 <p>As a control-type soul master, Ling Luochen’s held an enormous amount of control over her Ice. With Huo Yuhao’s elemental amplification, she was able to instantly gain the initiative with this attack.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao gritted her teeth. She knew that if this attack were to land, there was a high possibility that she wouldn’t be able to turn things around. She flapped her wings fiercely, which caused the soul power within her body to suddenly explode outwards. Amidst the sonorous cry of a phoenix, her body turned illusory. In that instant, she seemed to transform into a genuine phoenix. The golden-reddish light on her legs lit up, and she accelerated toward Ling Luochen as she activated her fifth soul ring. If she wasn’t able to deal with Ling Luochen, she wouldn’t have another chance to take back the initiative.</p>
 <p>However, how could Ling Luochen, who was the core control-type soul master of her team, be allowed to take on Ma Xiaotao’s all-out blow?</p>
 <p>Dai Yueheng’s muscular body suddenly appeared on the only path that Ma Xiaotao could take. Amidst the roar of a tiger, his sixth soul ring finally lit up.</p>
 <p>An enormous ‘KILL’ that alternated between black and white appeared in midair and collided with the charging Ma Xiaotao, who’d been assisted by her two leg soul bones.</p>
 <p>“Boom—” A violent undulation of soul power instantly spread outwards from the point of their collision, which forced everyone it to bend down and defend themselves.</p>
 <p>When the fierce, fiery red light collided with the golden-white tiger, they shot straight into the air. Their figures instantly separated once they’d collided with each other.</p>
 <p>Dai Yueheng was sent flying backwards from the collision, and two deep grooves had appeared on the ground below him. When he finally stopped, he was already knee-deep in the ground.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao wasn’t feeling any better. As she tumbled on the ground, she was struck by Ling Luochen’s icy ring, and was frozen into a dark-blue pillar of ice as a result.</p>
 <p>As for Gong Yangmo, even though his auxiliary abilities were extremely strong, he wasn’t specialised in combat. He Caitou did his best to rescue him with his soul tools, but a ten thousand year soul skill that held the power of Ultimate Ice wasn’t something that a Class 4 soul engineer could withstand. The power of Ice enveloped him, and he was frozen solid as well.</p>
 <p>There was no need to even mention Yao Haoxuan. Before he could destroy the icy prison that had entrapped him, Ling Luochen reinforced it. As a result, his massive body was sealed within the icy prison. With Huo Yuhao’s elemental amplification, Ling Luochen’s level of control over the battlefield had been at least doubled.</p>
 <p>The blood-red Soulchasing Sword flickered proudly as it shot forwards. It smashed into the solid pillars of ice that were Ma Xiaotao, Gong Yangmo, and Yao Haoxuan’s bodies, then flew towards Bei Bei, He Caitou, and Jiang Nannan.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei had already been injured, and he’d consumed an enormous amount of soul power. He Caitou’s consumption of soul power had been similarly enormous. Jiang Nannan had already expended all of her strength when she’d defended herself against the White Tiger’s Meteor Shower. How could the three of them currently defend themselves against Chen Zifeng’s powerful Soulchasing Sword? With the help of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection, the battle ended in just three breaths of time.</p>
 <p>The battles going on on the other side of the battlefield ended as well.</p>
 <p>When Dai Yueheng clashed against Ma Xiaotao, a flaw finally appeared in Xu Sanshi’s defense. How could Xi Xi give up on an opportunity like this? She charged towards Huo Yuhao, who stood behind Ling Luochen, with a flash.</p>
 <p>At that moment, however, Huo Yuhao suddenly turned around. Two bolts of purplish-golden lightning shot out of his eyes towards Xi Xi’s.</p>
 <p>Xi Xi only felt as if her head had been viciously smashed by a hammer. An instantaneous period of blankness overwhelmed her mind.</p>
 <p>Regardless of how quick she was, she was still a Soul King. Huo Yuhao had fused his Spiritual Shock with his Purple Demon eyes, and had utilized the spiritual power from the Haodong Power; even Ma Xiaotao would’ve been momentarily stunned by his attack.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao wasn’t the only person who’d made a move; Xiao Xiao, who’d been standing there and playing her flute by herself, finally made her a move as well. Her enormous pitch-black cauldron mightily rumbled forwards as she released her National Treasure, Cauldron’s Quaking Tremble. She used her strongest soul skill, then maneuvered it right in front of Xi Xi’s body with the help of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection. Even though Xi Xi had only been stunned for a single second, that was enough time for her.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s charged-up attack also finally arrived and struck Xi Xi. Even though she’d been able to quickly recover from Xiao Xiao’s Cauldron’s Quaking Tremble with her powerful cultivation, it wasn’t possible for her to dodge this attack.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s thousand year soul skill, the Butterfly Goddess Slash.</p>
 <p>Immediately after touching Xi Xi, the enormous ball of light instantly transformed into 108 blades of light, which crisscrossed as they struck her. Moreover, this skill had been strengthened by both the Haodong Power and the Golden Light. Once this attack had been released, he and Huo Yuhao fell to the ground, powerless.</p>
 <p>These 108 blades of light weren’t inferior to a powerful attack launched by a four-ringed Soul Ancestor. Even if Xi Xi was the quickest among everyone present, she was still flustered when she was struck by the attack. She’d never expected the three of them to be able to lay a trap for her with just their two and three-ringed cultivations.</p>
 <p>She went all-out and released three consecutive soul skills before she was able to dissolve the might of the Butterfly Goddess Slash. However, she wasn’t able to dodge the Shield of the Xuanwu Turtle that struck her from behind.</p>
 <p>The other battles had already ended, and Xi Xi was sent flying by the Shield of the Xuanwu Turtle. Now that he’d taken a breather, Dai Yueheng struck out with his palms and caught Xi Xi, who continued to flicker with electricity. Despite his hair standing up from her electricity, she still gave up the moment he extended his claws.</p>
 <p>The battle had ended, with the result of the battle still being a perfect victory. However, the victors were evidently different.</p>
 <p>Dai Yueheng, Chen Zifeng, and Ling Luochen weren’t joyous the moment the battle ended. Instead, they immediately turned towards Huo Yuhao, who was sitting on the ground.</p>
 <p>Chen Zifeng had an astonished look on his face. “Twin martial souls? And you, you also have them?” The other person he was referring to was naturally Xiao Xiao. He finally understood, at least to some extent, why Elder Xuan wanted to make them members of the preparatory team, despite them being so young.</p>
 <p>Ling Luochen’s question was only targeted towards Huo Yuhao, “Ultimate Ice?”</p>
 <p>What could Huo Yuhao do except nod?</p>
 <p>Dai Yueheng took a few steps forwards and helped Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong stand up. A trace of a smile appeared on his face. “Welcome to the preparatory team of the Shrek’s Seven Monsters. I know that you have a few conflicting views with my younger brother, but I’m not him. You don’t have to mind me. In the future, we’ll all be companions.”</p>
 <p>There was no doubt that Dai Yueheng’s words were equivalent to acknowledging Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong, and Xiao Xiao as members of the preparatory team.</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao didn’t feel happy in the least when he heard Dai Yueheng’s words. On the contrary, he became extremely vigilant. Dai Yueheng’s smile appeared to be genuine, but the more genuine it looked, the colder he felt in his heart. When he’d met the former earlier, the trace of killing intent that had flashed through his eyes hadn’t escaped Huo Yuhao’s keen Spirit Eyes.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Dai Yueheng was one of the sons of the White Tiger Duke, Huo Yuhao’s greatest foe.</p>
 <p>An enemy that could hide his feelings was undoubtedly much more dangerous than one who wore his feelings on his sleeve. As an upperclassman, Dai Yueheng was definitely more terrifying than Dai Huabin to Huo Yuhao. Moreover, he was also his elder brother! If it weren’t for the fact that Huo Yuhao looked more like his mother, Dai Yueheng would’ve noticed that something was wrong.</p>
