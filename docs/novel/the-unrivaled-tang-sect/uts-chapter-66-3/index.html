 <p><strong>Book 10: Shrek's Seven Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 66.3: Victory! Swap!</strong></p>
 <p>As such, it was Ma Xiaotao who got the short end of the stick when they met head-on.</p>
 <p>Following a thunderous roar, the Phoenix Meteor Shower suddenly stopped, and Ma Xiaotao’s body was sent reeling from the backlash.</p>
 <p>Currently, Dai Yueheng had released his first, third, and fifth soul skills. These skills were, respectively, the White Tiger’s Shield, the White Tiger’s Vajra Transformation, and the White Tiger’s Devilgod Transformation, all of which had the ability to strengthen his body.</p>
 <p>However, Ma Xiaotao hadn’t suffered a complete loss. When the two of them had collided, she’d used her fourth skill. Thus, even though she’d been knocked backwards and slightly wounded, her fourth skill had managed to interrupt Dai Yueheng’s strongest skill, his sixth skill. A fiery red ring was now revolving around Dai Yueheng’s body. Afterwards, it spread outwards and cancelled Yao Haoxuan’s buffs, which made Dai Yueheng’s body numb, and also made him incapable of using any of his soul skills.</p>
 <p>Of course, this state only lasted a very short time. After all, his body was currently under the effect of three powerful body-strengthening skills.</p>
 <p>But at that moment, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s dazzling Golden Road hit their target with great accuracy.</p>
 <p>The moment that Ma Xiaotao had been knocked back, a huge vertical eye had quietly appeared where she’d been standing before and releasing her Phoenix Meteor Shower.</p>
 <p>The golden radiance it emitted immediately covered an area fifty meters wide, and left a golden trail behind in the Assessment Area.</p>
 <p>Dai Yueheng, who was in a weakened state, had no choice but to meet the attack head-on. In an instant, the golden light passed through him. Moreover, Yao Haoxuan, who was still swallowing the last of Ma Xiaotao’s Phoenix Meteor Shower and had been about to spit one out, also ‘happened to be’ directly behind Dai Yueheng. As such, he was hit by the Golden Road as well. When the Golden Road struck them, two golden statues were left on the battlefield.</p>
 <p>Thunderous explosions then proceeded to happen one after another. Bei Bei roused his Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon martial soul and charged towards Chen Zifeng’s Soulchasing Sword. If he were to only rely on himself, it would be extremely difficult to deal with Chen Zifeng. However currently, a very dangerous flash of lightning was beside him. Even someone like Dai Yueheng was fearful of Xi Xi’s attacks, not to mention Chen Zifeng. And currently, he couldn’t avoid them.</p>
 <p>“Ti––” Amidst the cry of a phoenix, Ma Xiaotao rolled upwards while in midair. Immediately afterwards, she opened her phoenix wings and charged towards Dai Yueheng once again.</p>
 <p>At the same time, dozens of dazzling lights exploded towards the currently golden form of Yao Haoxuan.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s Golden Road had the disadvantage of it only being able to attack in a straight line. Despite this, its greatest advantage was its extremely high degree of power.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, Dai Yueheng’s body reverted back to normal in less than two seconds. However, this only applied to his outer appearance! His White Tiger martial soul was still temporarily neutralized.</p>
 <p>Yao Haoxuan was in the same situation. In fact, he seemed to be in an even more miserable state. He Caitou returned to his normal form from that of a four meter-tall giant, then used all the power in his soul tool to charge towards Yao Haoxuan.</p>
 <p>The outcome could be imagined: This time, it was Dai Yueheng that was sent flying. Yao Haoxuan was also covered in bruises once he was hit by He Caitou’s soul tool head-on; he was directly removed from the battlefield by Elder Xuan the moment that He Caitou’s attacks landed.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao didn’t go so far as to pursue and attack Dai Yueheng again. She unfurled her wings and looked arrogantly down at Chen Zifeng. “Admit defeat.”</p>
 <p>Originally, he’d already been at a disadvantage under the ‘Xi-Bei’ combo. However right now, he was the only one left from his team. What was the point in resisting? He could only helplessly retreat and put an end to the match.</p>
 <p>The fight had concluded, and it could be only described as an overwhelming victory. No one from Ma Xiaotao’s side had been eliminated, yet Dai Yueheng’s entire team had been annihilated.</p>
 <p>Nonetheless, Dai Yueheng hadn’t been injured. Ma Xiaotao had shown mercy when she’d sent him flying. He had a gloomy and surprised expression when he realized that they’d lost. He then looked towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong, both puzzled and astonished.</p>
 <p>How had they lost? They’d clearly held a huge advantage in terms of individual strength! How had four members of the main team lost so pitifully! Furthermore, the cause of their loss hadn’t even been the main members of the enemy team. In fact, he’d already made plans for the strongest of them, Ma Xiaotao. However, Wang Dong, Huo Yuhao, and even Bei Bei and He Caitou’s power had surpassed his expectations.</p>
 <p>The four members of the preparatory team on Ma Xiaotao’s side had played a great role in this battle, while the three reserves on his team had had little to no impact before they’d been eliminated. Moreover, Ling Luochen hadn’t even been able to display her abilities.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan came down from the sky with the students he’d rescued. “Quick, the losers should accept their punishment,” He said with a smile, “you’ll have another chance later.”</p>
 <p>“I’m a pig!” Dai Yueheng shouted without hesitation. However, his face still twitched, as he hadn’t accepted this loss in his heart!</p>
 <p>Yao Haoxuan and Chen Zifeng had no choice either; they shouted the words as well. When Ling Luochen said them, she was carefully scrutinizing Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao also said it without any problems. Even these seniors are shouting it. Would I really lose face if I were to shout it?</p>
 <p>Jiang Nannan also said in a low and soft voice, “I’m a pig.”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi attempted to flatter her, “As you’d expect from the woman I like. She still looks so cute even when she’s calling herself a pig.”</p>
 <p>Jiang Nannan glared at him and said, “Go away.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong, who was standing near Huo Yuhao, burst into laughter. However, he quickly turned his head away. Huo Yuhao’s face also twitched as he tried to hold back his laughter. Senior brother Xu was madly in love with Jiang Nannan. Despite this, Jiang Nannan was trying her best to not pay any attention to him. They were truly an interesting couple.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan said, “Good. You have a two hour break. Afterwards, since some of you still seem to be unconvinced, you’ll fight again.”</p>
 <p>When they heard that they would fight again, the seven disciples of the inner courtyard immediately sat down and began to recover their soul power. In the fight just now, everyone had used different quantities of soul power. As they meditated, they also went over the information they’d gained from the fight just now.</p>
 <p>When they saw this, Huo Yuhao and the others also sat down to recover their soul power. Of everyone present, he and Wang Dong had consumed the greatest amount of soul power. Moreover, they’d already used their Golden Road; they wouldn’t be able to use it again if they had to battle in a short while.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were slowly discovering the peculiarities of the Golden Road now that they’d used it in battle multiple times.</p>
 <p>The Golden Road itself possessed an incredible amount of destructive power. However, its limits were clearly visible when it was used against someone with a higher cultivation. It was a powerful fusion skill that combined both attack and control. Combined with Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection, many of its flaws were counterable. Currently, it was without a doubt their strongest skill.</p>
 <p>Without this skill, their overall strength would definitely drop by a large margin. However, it wasn’t like they were completely useless without it. Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was one of the best auxiliary skills a soul master could have. Moreover, they both also had a powerful thousand year soul skill, and Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate element could also suppress Ling Luochen. Countering an enemy Soul King was an extremely useful thing in a battle.</p>
 <p>The fight just now had left a very deep impression on Huo Yuhao. Being able to fight along these senior schoolmates had been of great help to him, as he hadn’t needed to show them the way. Just by being in the range of his Spiritual Detection, they’d be able to understand how they should proceed, and would display the right ability at the right moment. That had been an extremely wondrous feeling.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan casually chose a place to sit down. Afterwards, he took a greasy chicken leg out of nowhere and took a bite from it. Currently, his face that was hidden behind a mass of extraordinarily messy hair held a pensive expression. No one could tell what he was thinking.</p>
 <p>Two hours quickly passed, after which they were all back on their feet.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan also stood up. He took a large swig of alcohol, then said with a smile, “Kids, don’t be impatient. What’s the point of fighting with the same members once again? Therefore… Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong will switch teams with Yao Haoxuan and Jiang Nannan.”</p>
 <p>Both sides were surprised when they heard Elder Xuan’s words. The ones that had the biggest reaction were Dai Yueheng and Chen Zifeng. Both of them furrowed their brows. On the other hand, the normally cold Ling Luochen had a pensive expression.</p>
 <p>Jiang Nannan was eager to get away from Xu Sanshi. As such, she quickly moved towards the opposite party. Yao Haoxuan had a happy expression on his face as he asked Elder Xuan, “Elder Xuan, will the loser have to shout the same slogan as last time?”</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan immediately nodded and said, “Of course. I’m always fair, after all.”</p>
 <p>Chen Zifeng couldn’t refrain from asking, “Elder Xuan, I don’t think that this is fair. We just lost the battle, yet you’ve replaced our members with weaker ones…”</p>
 <p>When Xiao Xiao heard Chen Zifeng’s words, she angrily retorted, “Senior schoolmate, how could you consider Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong weak? They played a decisive role in the previous battle!”</p>
 <p>Chen Zifeng replied, “I’ll take those words back if they can still use their fusion skill.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao was immediately dumbfounded; this was still a problem! Given their current strength, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong definitely wouldn’t be able to use their Golden Road again. With this, their overall power would be greatly reduced.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan indifferently said, “Silence. It was an order. I wasn’t asking for your opinion. If you have some skills, you better use them in the fight. Before criticizing your teammates, you should make sure to not act like a pig yourself. Now then, make the changes that I said.”</p>
 <p>As Elder Xuan spoke in a grave tone, a burst of oppressive aura began to spread over the area. None of the students dared to say another word and they quietly exchanged members.</p>
 <p>Besides Chen Zifeng, Ma Xiaotao was also unwilling to make this exchange. Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was just too useful! Without him, would they still be able to have a tacit understanding like before?</p>
 <p>When Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong arrived at the opposite side, Yao Haoxuan and Jiang Nannan also took their places in the opposite party. Just looking at their line up, Ma Xiaotao’s team seemed to have the advantage. Four of them were members of the main team, while the other three members from the preparatory team were all Soul Ancestors.</p>
