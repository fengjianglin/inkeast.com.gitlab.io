The other Titled Douluo were not idle as they also used their pure soul power to form a barrier. After Elder Xuan cast his big barrier, the others cast smaller ones. They were now one step closer to protecting everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These kids were the best soul masters of the next generation. Furthermore, Shrek Academy was ultimately still a school, not a sect. No matter what happened, the safety of their students took precedence. Bringing these kids back safely was more important than anything else!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was in a state of deep thought. He searched his memory. This phenomenon seemed similar to something he had seen before...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as he was inside the human-shaped soul tool, his friends could not see what he was up to. Everyone else was tense, and no one had the time to look at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The attractive energy appeared to be getting stronger. However, it was not destructive. The protective soul barrier Elder Xuan had unleashed separated them from the outside world. Everyone released their martial souls in preparation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To them, the situation was too odd. Even Elder Xuan, someone with the cultivation of an Ultimate Douluo, could not resist it head-on. What terrifying power! While an Ultimate Douluo was not strong enough to move mountains or drain oceans, it would not be difficult for him to wreck an entire city!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And yet, he could not resist this shapeless gold and silver energy...</span></p>

His body shook, and his nine soul rings shone brightly. His body started to expand, and he turned into a Godly Taotie Bull, sweeping everyone onto his back. The light he unleashed became brighter, and they were now being moved at a much slower speed. While they were still moving, it was no longer as quickly as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They continued to fly through the air, pulled by the attractive power. As they could not sense their surroundings, and their sight was blocked by the fog, everyone felt as if they were in the clouds…</span></p>

They had emerged from the thick fog.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While they were in the thick fog, they all sensed danger around them. However, at this moment, they were shocked by the majestic water before them. All of their negative emotions from before were gone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before them was a wide lake. It was surrounded by mountains, and the water of the lake was so clear that one could see its bottom. Strangely, the water was gold and silver!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the center of the lake was a round patch of gold. The intense golden light spread outward from the patch as if it were a reflection of the sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They could see a moon encircling it, sun and moon connected to one other. The moon gave off a silver light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vast lake was completely dominated by these two colors of gold and silver. The two-colored light spread outward non-stop. It crept across the mountain and spread far into the distance. How beautiful, how stunning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone looked dazedly at the scene before them, rather disbelieving. However, it was real. Furthermore, under the pull of the gold and silver light, they gradually approached the center of the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know!” Huo Yuhao shouted. When he saw the shocking scene before his eyes, all the dots in his brain connected. He finally thought of where he had heard about this curious scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He said urgently, almost shouting, “Later, no matter what we encounter, if a voice asks you questions, you must reply truthfully! If you lie, you’ll be in mortal danger! Remember, remember, remember to speak the truth, especially when it comes to relationships! You must not lie!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when he finished, they were already in the center of the lake, above the golden sun and the silver moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden sun and silver moon in the lake became extremely radiant. The radiant gold light and the bright silver light started to rise and engulf all of them, including Elder Xuan, who was still in his Godly Taotie Bull form!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This power was extremely unique. It appeared about them effortlessly. They could feel it, but they realized that they were unable to control it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan’s Martial Soul True Body was forced back into his original shape by the two-colored light before they were all completely covered by it. When they could see other again, they were shocked to discover that they were all placed inside separate gold and silver bubbles, floating in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was split apart, and no two people were together. Many of them were terrified. All they could remember were Huo Yuhao’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Huo Yuhao said that, he had used his spiritual power. His words were imprinted in all of their minds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before they could make any more observations, the gold and silver bubbles started to descend into the sun and moon in the center of the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er looked at Huo Yuhao, and he looked back at her. He nodded at her vigorously and gestured toward her. His meaning was clear:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Don’t worry about me, do as I said!</span></p>

However, the students of Shrek Academy were the top of their generation. In comparison, they were taking it all rather well. While they were shocked, surprised, and a bit terrified, they all seemed relatively stable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were loud plops as the gold and silver light that surrounded them dropped them into the lake.</span></p>

Instead, heaven and earth spun around. At this moment, he recalled his source of information about this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had first encountered records of this place from the Icefire Yin Yang Well in the Setting Sun Forest, where he had obtained the Poison Chapter from the ancestor of the Tang Sect, Tang San.</span></p>

It contained the power of Ultimate Ice and Ultimate Fire, and was extremely dangerous. However, it contained countless natural treasures as well. Any plant that grew there would grow ten times faster. Those who could enter it would benefit immensely. &nbsp;</span></p>

Then, he was able to retrieve the Yearning Heartbroken Grass to save Wang Dong’er. However, he was also severely injured by the Blazing Sunspring and the Extreme Chill Icespring, and barely made it back alive.</span></p>

He had to surmount countless dangers before he could enter the Icefire Yin Yang Well! If not for his abilities, which were barely enough, there was no way he could have entered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The place before him was another of the Three Great Blessed Lands. It was ranked above the Icefire Yin Yang Well, and it was the top Blessed Land among the three.</span></p>
