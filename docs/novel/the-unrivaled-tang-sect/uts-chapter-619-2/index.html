 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The control that Huo Yuhao had relinquished earlier now returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two soul cores that had completed the Yin-Yang Complement sank. Huo Yuhao’s third soul core returned to his dantian, where it was supposed to be. What about his second soul core? It returned to his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to the Yin-Yang Complement method, both his soul cores were already shining extremely brightly. The immense spiritual power that came from his first soul core also sank at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it came, it didn’t just clash with one other soul core. It directly collided against the chain between the second and third soul cores. Immense spiritual power was directly poured into that rapidly spinning whirlpool-like soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ultimate Ice and spiritual soul cores were originally fused through the Yin-Yang Complement method. Naturally, they complemented each other. And his Ultimate Ice and third soul cores had undergone the same fusion right now. Due to this, the fusion of the third soul core was unprecedentedly harmonious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core was the strongest out of the three. Its strength sank down to the Ultimate Ice soul core. After it fused with his Ultimate Ice soul core, it continued to sink down to his third soul core before it fused and assimilated. The strength of Huo Yuhao’s second and third soul cores helped to neutralize the strength of the spiritual soul core, which was much stronger than either of the other two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strange balance was formed as a result. It was like a link that was moving up and down in Huo Yuhao’s body. After Huo Yuhao’s soul power fused many times, it gathered in his dantian. It then entered his passageways through his Mysterious Heaven Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The earlier mess and chaos vanished. The result was that Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was mainly gathered in his head, whereas his dantian was where his soul power gathered. At the same time, he possessed three different elements – spiritual, Ultimate Ice and space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fusion of the third soul core was complete!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire process sounded very complicated, and it was even more complex in real life. The reason why Huo Yuhao was able to complete the most important part was because his spiritual power was strong enough, and his spiritual control was precise enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao slowly put down his right hand. Thorn-shaped halos were silently flashing around Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, there was something special there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Evileye Tyrant King was killed by Huo Yuhao, he didn’t just leave behind a seven hundred thousand year soul core. He also left a small eye. That eye was in the shape of a vertical eye. It wasn’t a decoration; it was the soul bone that the Evileye Tyrant King had left behind. It was an unprecedented external soul bone, an Evileye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under normal conditions, no human could absorb this Evileye. First, it was because it contained too much spiritual power. Next, it was also a vertical eye. It couldn’t even be said to be a soul bone. It was just a manifestation of a strange form of energy, but it was superior to soul bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It contained the purest spiritual power, as well as some of the memories of the Evileye Tyrant King with regards to his abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he tried to take over Huo Yuhao, he actually paid a huge price. After all, his main body was gone, and he couldn’t possibly pour in all his strength into his soul rings to fuse with Huo Yuhao. Given this, he left some of his soul skills in his eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he had failed. The control left behind in this eye naturally disappeared. Huo Yuhao managed to unleash his spiritual power by fusing with this Evileye at the last moment. This increased his spiritual control to the maximum, which led to the fusion process earlier. Otherwise, it couldn’t have been completed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He only fully recovered after a long rest after he completed his fusion. Next, it was time to help Tang Wutong. Given his spiritual cultivation and control, he was Tang Wutong’s Evileye. No, rather, he was the Eye of Asura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening to Di Tian’s astonished voice, he was reminded of the torment he went through to cultivate his third soul core. His success was tightly related to luck. If not for the Dragon Emperor Douluo’s immense soul power and the Evileye Tyrant King’s soul ring and eye, he wouldn’t have stood a chance at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only through trying that he knew that forming a third soul core was actually so difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the first in history to complete it. While Tang Wutong was the second, she only succeeded with his help. Of course, that was also because their martial souls were complementary. It wasn’t impossible for Huo Yuhao to help someone else form a third soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of the volume of soul power, Huo Yuhao was still inferior to Di Tian. However, Di Tian was still shocked because of the immense soul power generated from his three soul cores. This was because Huo Yuhao’s soul power was superior to his quality-wise. They were inseparable after their first confrontation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were separated by that black hole. Even with their cultivations, they didn’t dare to get close to it. The suction force coming from that black hole was simply too terrifying. It was a phenomenon of space being torn apart. Once they were sucked in, there was no turning back. They also didn’t know where they would be transported to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s gaze suddenly shifted. After this, he shifted lightning-quick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was because neither of them could use spatial power given this huge crack in space. This was why he could only rely on his speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he moved, the Beast God also moved. He shifted at the same time. Undoubtedly, he was trying to make his way around the black hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black hole slowly shut. However, both Huo Yuhao and Di Tian both knew that space had been completely crushed. It would take a long time for it to be completely healed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They both moved hundreds of kilometers instantly and stopped at the same time, as if they were telepathic. Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny opened. He pointed his right hand at Di Tian. Before his soul rings even appeared, a whirlpool and a skull appeared behind Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Confusion and Spiritual Enfeeblement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian revealed a cold smile on his face. “Useless. Your soul skills won’t have any effect on me. No matter how strong your spiritual power is, they won’t work. Unless you are much more powerful than me, dragons are immune to most spiritual attacks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he pointed at Huo Yuhao. Suddenly, the space around Huo Yuhao seemed to bubble. Purplish air bubbles suddenly appeared before they blew apart, turning into countless purple billows that moved towards the giant dragon in the center. After this, they surrounded the dragon as it shot into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corrosiveness of the darkness element was properly demonstrated right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that purple region soon stopped. It slowly turned white and smooth, and transparent snowflakes fell from the top. After this, the purple whirlpool from before slowly dissipated. It turned into countless snowflakes before scattering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The air temperature, which was extremely chilly, fell even more dramatically. The entire sky was covered in a hazy fog, which Huo Yuhao used to conceal himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems like you’ve understood the true meaning behind Ultimate Ice.” Di Tian nodded as he complimented Huo Yuhao. He waved his right hand, and the snowflakes that came in front of him naturally dispersed. He didn’t retract his right hand. It transformed instead. His joints became huge and thick. After this, scales started to surface and form a dragon claw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Dragon God’s Claw. Di Tian was actually prepared to use his Dragon God’s Claw against Huo Yuhao in this fight?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it appeared, it felt as if something mighty and terrifying had appeared in heaven and earth, even though Di Tian didn’t attack. The snowflakes that Huo Yuhao had formed were crushed at this instant. They turned into powder and instantly disappeared. Huo Yuhao was even revealed from the fog, and his body shook slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian’s expression also turned serious as he faced his Dragon God’s Claw towards Huo Yuhao. Behind him, a projection of a huge black dragon surfaced. Above this projection was a ball of rainbow light, shining brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had never seen Di Tian in this form before. He only felt helpless, like an irresistible force was restraining his body and soul. The pressure on him kept mounting, as if it wanted to crush him just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Dragon God’s Claw was only tapping into the strength of the Dragon God, it was still left behind by the Dragon God for Di Tian. Di Tian was also able to make breakthrough after breakthrough with it, eventually becoming the Beast God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t the strength of gods, but it was beyond the strength of an Ultimate Douluo. It was like it came from a demigod!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The biggest problem with Huo Yuhao was that he hadn’t expected Di Tian to use his greatest strength the moment the fight started. From this earlier interaction, he knew that he had lost. He had lost to the Beast God’s experience and slyness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his heart, Di Tian’s superiority influenced his judgment. He didn’t demonstrate any arrogance at all. Instead, he revealed his greatest strength to pressure Huo Yuhao. He didn’t give him any chance at all.</span></p>
