 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a dazed look on her face, while her gaze was filled with sadness amid the confusion. “Yes! Perhaps I’ve really fallen for him. Snow, you’re wrong. You shouldn’t have killed him. By killing him, I’ll never be together with you anymore. Perhaps I’ve not fallen in love with him, but I’ll never be able to get together with you because he died under your hands. Otherwise, how can I live up to the feelings he had for me? Although he wasn’t strong, and was even my enemy in the past, he’s been really very good to me. I’ve always felt a sense of hope with him around.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve destroyed my hope. Snow, why did you have to do that? Why do you have to make me stand on different ground from you? He’s dead, which means that my heart will never belong to you anymore. Do you know? You were wrong. You were wrong to kill him. By killing him, you’ve destroyed the relationship between us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress sighed and said, “Are you really not in love with him? Because of him, you’re even willing to give up on our hundreds of thousands of years together. I wasn’t wrong. I was right. Perhaps even you didn’t know that you’ve fallen in love with him. It’s just that you weren’t willing to admit it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re wrong. You’re wrong!” The Ice Empress was shouting maniacally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled. Her smile was very beautiful. She was normally very indifferent and cold, and often appeared very unapproachable. However, she was extremely captivating when she smiled. Her smile even gave off a sense of warmth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not wrong, Ice. Silly girl, I’m only helping you see yourself more clearly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, the Snow Empress stood to one side. Behind her, the deep-blue from the Skydream Iceworm slowly faded away, and he also slowly turned around, revealing a teary face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ice, Ice, Ice, Ice…” The Skydream Iceworm’s voice was trembling. He couldn’t even call her name properly and his body was shuddering non-stop. His eyes were already filled with emotional undulations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress was stunned as she saw the tears on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’s not dead. He’s actually not dead. He’s alive, he’s still alive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah!” The Ice Empress screamed and instantly turned into a flowing streak of jade-green light. She crashed straight into the Skydream Iceworm’s arms and hugged him tightly. However, she was sobbing furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them hugged each other as they cried. The feelings that they had always been hiding for each other were finally revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress was drifting not far from them. There was a warm smile on her face as she muttered to herself, “I told you... I was right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Snow Empress.” Huo Yuhao spoke up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had already awoken from his meditation. He saw everything that had happened. In fact, he already knew what the Snow Empress was intending to do when she hit the Skydream Iceworm earlier. As the Snow Empress was closely connected to him and was even his Spirit, he knew that she didn’t unleash her Snowless Glacier. How could it be so destructive if that was the case?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress drifted up beside Huo Yuhao and said, “I’ve already regained my memory. If I didn’t do this, Ice would still be conflicted. She wouldn’t be able to acknowledge her true feelings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked at the Snow Empress and softly said, “Have you ever liked the Ice Empress? You’re too noble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress revealed a subtle bitter smile on her face, and her thoughts rang out in Huo Yuhao’s mind, “I’m not noble. I’ve always only had sisterly love for Ice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao suddenly understood, and his expression turned slightly weird as he looked at the Snow Empress. However, there was more of a warm smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that the Skydream Iceworm had finally won the heart of the woman he loved, he was delighted! This was perfect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm was the first to stop crying, but he was still hugging the Ice Empress tightly. The Ice Empress’ cries slowly stopped too, but she was unwilling to lift her head. She buried her head in the Skydream Iceworm’s embrace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm lifted his head to look at Huo Yuhao. Seeing that he was amused, he immediately turned red, and nodded gratefully at the Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled and didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ice, everything’s fine. Everything’s fine. I’ll protect you in the future. Did you know? Today is the happiest day of my life. It’s true. I’m really happy. I’m the most blissful iceworm in the world. I must be!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress snorted lightly and smacked his shoulder. Suddenly, she forced herself from his embrace and turned into a streak of jade-green light before disappearing into Huo Yuhao’s body. She was truly embarrassed right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm chortled as he watched the Ice Empress disappear. He rubbed the tears off his face, and there was only a coquettish look left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Continue absorbing!” As he spoke, he posed coquettishly, placing one hand on his waist and grabbing the second Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence with the other, continuing his earlier absorption.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-----------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed very quickly. After the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass completely absorbed its sixth pillar of Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, the Skydream Iceworm also completed the absorption of his third pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was only his third one, it was still sufficient to strengthen the foundations of his spiritual origins. It was just that most parts of his body were spiritual-type, which was why he was unable to seal some ice essence for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass was much stronger in this aspect. It had absorbed four for itself, and sealed another two for Huo Yuhao. It was only inferior to the Ice Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, there were only six pillars of ice essence left. The temperature in this cavern had also started to rise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, do you sense it? Although there’s much less ice essence here, the temperature isn’t rising quickly. Why is this?” the Snow Empress asked Huo Yuhao after allowing both the Skydream Iceworm and the Mysterious Ice Grass to return to Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “It’s because the temperature here is too low. A lot of thermal energy is needed to make the temperature rise. However, there is very little thermal energy in this cold spring. Even if we take all the ice essence away, the temperature here will still take some time before it starts to rise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress nodded and said, “That’s right. Alright, you can absorb the last six pillars. You should be able to bear this amount of ice essence, given the strength of your body. I’ll help you. Don’t worry. Go and stand in the center.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao agreed and went to the center of the ice cavern. He increasingly felt that it was a good thing that the Snow Empress had regained her memory. Not only was she a strong partner, she was also like a teacher as she kept on helping him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress drifted in place, and her white dress danced in the air like a fairy. As she waved her hand, her sleeves shot up, and the last six pillars of ice essence suddenly drifted into the air. They surrounded Huo Yuhao in six different directions and were separated from one another at exact distances and angles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These six pillars were like six ice sticks of life energy. They exuded a dim light, and a gentle white glow emanated from the Snow Empress on the ice essences. Suddenly, all the ice essences lit up, and shone with a bright blue glow. The Ultimate Ice origin energy in the air started to become more and more concentrated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately sensed greater viscosity in the surrounding air. The extremely pure ice essence was even purer than his fluid soul power. Gentle soul power started to seep into his body in streaks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t even need to intentionally circulate his soul power before his soul power began to circulate in the path of his Mysterious Heaven Technique. The Ice Empress’ tattoo on his back became clearer, and his entire body was glowing jade-blue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very quickly, Huo Yuhao’s soul power was completely nourished. Following that, he felt that his entire body was ballooning up. It was also at this time that the fusion of Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence in his body began to slow down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With every round of circulation, Huo Yuhao’s soul power would fuse more and more with the ice essence. He could sense that he wasn’t fully absorbing the ice essence. However, it was being turned into spots before being stored within his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Huo Yuhao’s original soul power was fluid, these ice essences that he had just fused into his body but was unable to absorb had turned into thin ice floes within his fluid soul power. Under such conditions, he was able to store more and more Ultimate Ice origin energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body was becoming stronger and stronger under the nourishment of his Life Gold, his passageways becoming more and more resilient. Even if he wasn’t able to absorb the ice essences, he could still store them. As his soul power circulated, his ballooning body slowly began to feel more and more comfortable. As his body gradually fused with the ice essences, the speed at which the ice essences surged into his body increased.</span></p>
