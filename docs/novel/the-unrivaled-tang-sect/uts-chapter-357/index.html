Instead, Huo Yuhao continued to punch at her with all his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Using strength against me?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as this thought rose in Wang Qiu’er’s mind, Huo Yuhao struck her with his fist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to her original calculations and her understanding of Huo Yuhao, she could easily swat his right fist to the side with a palm-strike. If Huo Yuhao did not use his Spiritual Shock, with his strength, there was no way he could resist the strength of her right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this judgment was based on Wang Qiu’er’s past understanding of Huo Yuhao. What if his offensive capabilities had changed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment she hit his right fist with her left palm, Wang Qiu’er sensed that something was amiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s fist was not filled with spiritual power, but it was shockingly strong. Her palm was not powerful enough to knock his fist to one side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Wang Qiu’er brimmed with fighting experience. Since she could not knock it aside, she immediately lowered her wrist and changed it from a palm-strike to a push as she tried to block Huo Yuhao’s fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even so, she changed her attack at the last minute, and hence was unable to maximize her strength. Under the immense strength of Huo Yuhao’s right fist, he was able to strike her left shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er grunted, and her body was sent flying. Her hand, which she had used to grab Huo Yuhao’s head, let go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How can this be possible?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ning Tian and Wu Feng stared at this scene in shock. While they both knew that Huo Yuhao was strong, they had never expected him to be so strong to the point where he could resist Wang Qiu’er in a head-on fight!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is a face-to-face fight, pure and simple. Doesn’t he have only five rings? Why is he so strong?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Questions surfaced in Ning Tian and Wu Feng’s minds non-stop. Since the Continental Elite Youth Soul Master Tournament, they had both trained hard and improved rapidly. After they made it to the semi-finals, their confidence peaked, and they even anticipated their showdown against the Tang Sect in the finals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the explosion happened, causing the finals to be called off, some, if not all of them, were despondent. They would not be able to defeat the Tang Sect under Wang Qiu’er’s leadership, and this was their greatest regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, today, in this mysterious Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley, they finally understood the difference between the Tang Sect and themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan, whom they perceived to be the weakest, was able to defeat both of them by herself. If one said that it was because she specialized in close-combat, and hence had an advantage in this small space, what about the fight before them right now? What about the fight between Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er? What could they say?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While victory and defeat had yet to be decided, Huo Yuhao now had an absolute advantage over Wang Qiu’er, forcing her back step-by-step. If Huo Yuhao alone was already so powerful, how powerful were the others of Shrek’s Seven Monsters?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Tang Sect defeated the Holy Ghost Sect, everyone, both those from Shrek Academy and outsiders, attributed it to luck. The only thing they could not explain was Huo Yuhao’s mysterious final attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they personally experienced it today, forcing both Ning Tian and Wu Feng to admit that there was a huge disparity between the Tang Sect and themselves. This was no small difference!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She crashed, rebounded, and landed. Like a lioness, Wang Qiu’er bounced back into the air instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she had fought Huo Yuhao in close-combat just now, she let go of her Golden Dragon Spear. At this moment, it was back in her hands. A light screen appeared in front of her, blocking any possibility of Huo Yuhao continuing his attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he did not continue. Instead, he stood where the two of them had clashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On his forehead, a piece of metal of his helmet slid to one side to reveal a mysterious vertical eye. A mystical golden light appeared as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Oh no, he’s going to use Spiritual Shock.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er subconsciously let go of her Golden Dragon Spear as she used all her might to concentrate her spiritual power. At the same time, her soul power rose around her. A golden dragon swirled around her body. Offense turned into defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Spiritual Shock which she had expected did not appear. Instead, a shocking scene took place before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ripples started to appear in the air nearby. Twisted, round waves started to spread outward with Huo Yuhao at their center. Rays of light shone, and the air around him twisted. Everything around him looked mysteriously like ripples of water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The area of the wheel was not large. At this moment, it was completely enveloped within the ripples, and started to twist. There was no dead end or crack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er had never seen Huo Yuhao use this power before, and she naturally did not know its secret. Her heart turned cold, and she slashed horizontally with her Golden Dragon Spear. A golden light screen started to spread outward. A patch of golden light burst forth from her spear as it attacked the distorted air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s objective was simple. She tried to find out what it was by attacking it to ascertaining his location. Once she found him, she would lock onto him and then attack him with all her might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this powerful ability, which Huo Yuhao had used as his trump card against the Holy Ghost Sect, could not be overcome so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As golden light dashed past the ripples, it disappeared soundlessly. The air around him started to tremble even more intensely, but the area where a bit of light could still be seen disappeared completely. That was right, it disappeared completely. It was as if Huo Yuhao had never been there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Wang Qiu’er sensed that something was wrong.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Can this transformation come from the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she soon discarded this thought. While this place was mysterious, it operated on set principles. Whenever that mysterious voice spoke, it would not backtrack on its words. Since it said that it would let her fight Huo Yuhao, there should be no unexpected change to it. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao specialized in spiritual power.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This should be a new ability of his. However, he hasn’t increased his soul rings. Did he make this ability himself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ability Huo Yuhao was using now was not something he had made himself. No matter how powerful he was, he had yet to reach that stage. Among the four soul skills the Skydream Iceworm gave him, the most useless one seemed to be Spiritual Interference. But as Huo Yuhao increased his own spiritual power ceaselessly, he was able to combine it with Imitation to form this mysterious domain. He called it the Skydream Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao’s cultivation was still limited. He had to accumulate power for some time before he could use the Skydream Domain. Wang Qiu’er was the first one to experience the full version of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three Huo Yuhaos suddenly appeared in front of Wang Qiu’er. Three rays of emerald-green light shot at her simultaneously from different directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was shocked. She crossed her Golden Dragon Spear with her left hand. She stabbed toward the left and punched toward the right, and her Coiling Golden Dragon appeared and swirled around her body as she faced the last attack head-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she discovered that she had been tricked. The attacks that came from three different directions disappeared in the next instant. Her attempts to resist it with all her might were for naught.</span></p>

However, she did not dare to be careless. Right now, she was at the edge of the space. At least, she still remembered where was. If she charged forward, she would be trapped within the domain. Then she would be in even bigger trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She held the Golden Dragon Spear in front of her protectively, and her coiling Golden Dragon continued to twist and turn around her protectively. Wang Qiu’er closed her eyes. Instantly, her body emitted a layer of mysterious golden light. This was her innate skill, Golden Dragon’s Perception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Golden Dragon’s Perception could not break Huo Yuhao’s domain, it was able to greatly augment her analysis of her own predicament. Once an actual attack came, she would be able to resist it and counter-attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mysterious scene was now in a stalemate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon Perception and Coiling Golden Dragon both required soul power. Huo Yuhao’s Skydream Domain not only required soul power, but also required spiritual power. If they continued this stalemate, it would become a competition to see who could last the longest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve lost.” Huo Yuhao’s voice rang out. Then, the twisted surroundings disappeared completely. He remained where he was as if nothing had changed. However, Wang Qiu’er’s attack in his direction had been futile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How did you lose?” Wang Qiu’er asked, glaring at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled bitterly and said, “Don’t forget, I only have five rings. Furthermore, the area of this domain-type soul skill is too large, so naturally, much of my soul power is going to be wasted. From the start, I only had a few reliable skills. If we continue to fight, I don’t really have a chance. Furthermore, your Golden Dragon Perception checks my domain. My only way to win would be a battle of attrition. However, like this, my soul power will run out first. Hence, the final victor will still be you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was extremely sincere, but Wang Qiu’er sensed that something was amiss.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled bitterly and said, “Tell me, among my moves, which one can beat you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have…” Wang Qiu’er was just about to say “The Pride of the Ice and Snow Empresses”, which he used that day. However, she immediately realized that he was only able to use it in the Purple Golden Butterfly Dragon Transformation state. However, as he had not fused with Wang Dong’er, there was no way he could use it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She thought about it, and realized that there really was no skill he could use to beat her!</span></p>

We’re having a fair fight, and you want me to use a Milk Bottle? Do you think this place will allow me to fight you unfairly? Furthermore, if I use a Milk Bottle, I’ll lose my concentration. I wouldn’t even be able to maintain the domain. I’ve lost. Dong’er and I have lost. You pass.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, as Huo Yuhao admitted defeat, the voice rang out, “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er wins.

Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er returned to their original places.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could Huo Yuhao really beat Wang Qiu’er? Even he did not know the answer to this question. He did have many attacks he could use, but how powerful was Wang Qiu’er? She was known as the strongest soul master with a dragon martial soul. Wang Qiu’er’s strongest trait was that if she faced a more powerful opponent, she would respond with strength in kind. The strength of her opponent was often enough to make her perform extraordinarily. Furthermore, with her Ultimate Strength, even if she ran out of soul power, her fighting abilities might not decrease. Furthermore, if she used all her strength, even a Soul Sage or a Soul Douluo would not dare to fight her head-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had never planned on winning. He planned to face her head-on and gain an advantage before conceding defeat. This was the best possible outcome. This would not cause him to lose confidence in facing Wang Qiu’er, but it would also clearly show the results of this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Huo Yuhao thought that they would be sent back to their original spots to continue with the mysterious wheel, the calm voice rang out coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a two against one fight, you did not use all your strength, and hence, violated the rules. You conceded defeat deliberately and thus, you will be punished with the Deep Adventure</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">.” Two rays of light flashed, and before Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er could say anything in response, they were whisked away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This…</span></p>

When Dai Huabin faced off against Zhu Lu earlier on, he conceded defeat straightaway! However, this mysterious place did not say that they cheated, and instead, it allowed Zhu Lu to progress. Under her pleas, it then sent her to Deep Adventure as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after the fair fight between Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er, they were deemed to have cheated because Wang Dong’er did not participate. What kind of rule was this?</span></p>

This time, the light appeared underneath Ning Tian’s feet.</span></p>

After all, there was no way she could beat Wu Feng one-on-one.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If I have to go to the Deep Adventure, so be it!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Ning Tian clearly knew that as an auxiliary-type soul master, entering the Deep Adventure was akin to a death sentence, she was resolute in her decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emotionally, she was still confused. She had always known that Wu Feng liked her, but she was heterosexual. The only one she liked in the younger generation was Huo Yuhao. However, Huo Yuhao had chosen Wang Dong’er, who was better than her in all aspects. This made her lose confidence.</span></p>
