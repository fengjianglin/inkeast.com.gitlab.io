 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

He’s very mysterious. This mission is going to be very difficult. No, I must talk to Elder Xuan. How can he let you do something like this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao hurriedly said, “Eldest senior, don’t be anxious. Elder Xuan didn’t force me to go on this mission. He told me that I could explore further if I had the opportunity to. Furthermore, I have my Spiritual Detection! My Spiritual Detection can cover a greater distance than that Death God’s Ray. It wouldn’t be too much of a problem for me to examine it from a distance. If I can’t win, I can still flee. In addition, Elder Xuan also asked me to bring a few people along with me this time. I can choose from the Tang Sect’s members.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He recounted everything that Elder Xuan had told him to the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei didn’t say anything, but Xu Sanshi was already jumping in excitement. “This is great! I can finally leave Shrek City! Little junior, you don’t know how bored I’ve been. I’ve been helping Bei Bei deal with all types of matters in the Tang Sect over these past few days. It’s been extremely annoying. It’ll be great to step onto a battlefield. This is set, Nannan and I will follow you. Oh yes, my soul power is at Rank 70 already. Can you help me get a Spirit when we return? Nannan’s soul power is also almost at that stage too. I want a nice and smart Spirit. Oh, seven rings is just suitable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned when he looked at Xu Sanshi. Everyone’s abilities had been growing very quickly. He then turned to look at Bei Bei and asked, “Eldest senior, what about you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei smiled as he nodded and said, “I’m at around the same level as him. I’ll need a Spirit soon, too. If you don’t return again, we’ll have to go to the Spirit Pagoda. Of course, we’ll have to wait for Nannan. Caitou is also at Rank 70.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After passing the tests in the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley, everyone’s soul power had improved by leaps and bounds. Apart from Xiao Xiao, they were all at the Rank 70 bottleneck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Why don’t we enter the Great Star Dou Forest directly and ask for suitable soul beasts as Spirits? That would be the most effective solution.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi chuckled as he answered, “It’ll definitely be the most effective if you lead us in. Those savage beasts treat you like a gem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan knocked his head and said, “Can you speak more nicely? What gem? Huo Yuhao is now the one controlling the destiny of the entire Great Star Dou Forest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao thought for a moment before replying, “Since this is the case, let’s leave in two days. We’ll go to the Great Star Dou Forest tomorrow. Xiao Xiao, how far off are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao was a little depressed as she answered, “Three ranks. I’m at Rank 67 now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed. “Don’t be depressed. At our age, we’re already considered some of the best on the continent with our current soul power. If you continue being depressed, the other soul masters are better off being dead. Don’t worry, I’ll return soon. Once you reach Rank 70, don’t be too impatient to obtain another soul ring. Wait for me to come back, and we’ll help you get one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned to Bei Bei and asked, “Oh yes, eldest senior, I forgot one more thing. What about our two Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei replied, “They’re in the outer courtyard. Speaking of those two fellows, they are almost bankrupting our sect with the amount of food that they eat. They eat everything, and the amount of food that they eat is almost equivalent to the total amount of food that all of us consume. It hasn’t even been two years, but the two of them are already more than two meters tall. Their claws are also very destructive, no construction material is able to resist the strength of their claws!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The last time, Big Blackie even secretly ate the medicine that the Academy gave to Teacher Xuan. But that fellow is quite interesting. He gave some of the medicine that he stole to Lil Blackie. After eating the medicine, the two of them became much more obedient, and fell asleep for a few days. However, their appetite became even more voracious after they woke up. We are slowly becoming unable to feed them anymore. If we can’t feed them, we’ll have to release them back into the Great Star Dou Forest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “We can’t send them back. The blood lineage of Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears is too strong. They are the enemies of almost all soul beasts. They are still so small now. If we send them back now, they’ll definitely be attacked. We’ll be harming them. How’s their relationship with everyone right now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan laughed, “It’s great. The two of them deliberately act cute all the time. They make everyone very happy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “That’s great. Eldest senior, what do you think if we send both of them to the Setting Sun Forest?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Setting Sun Forest? You’re saying?” Bei Bei suddenly thought of something, and exchanged a glance with Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “The development of soul beasts is greatly tied to their energy intake. That place is most suitable for them. Since the Sun Moon Empire started this war, and things are getting more and more chaotic, the Tang Sect also needs a stronger force to be protected by. If we let them remain there for some time, I believe they’ll grow even faster.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei hesitated a little. “Will it be too much?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “Nothing will happen to them. Many of the plant-type soul beasts there are ten-thousand year soul beasts. They’ll be strong enough to restrain them. With us around, those plant-type soul beasts won’t dare to do anything to them, either. Let’s just leave them there. There aren’t any other soul beasts or natural enemies of Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears in the Setting Sun Forest anyway. It’s the most suitable place for them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei said, “Since this is the case, let’s do it. I’ll make a trip later and send them there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Eldest senior, the poison over there is lethal, you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei said, “Don’t worry, Teacher Xuan’s newly-invented protective barrier for Class 7 All-Terrain Self-Driving Forts will be able to protect me. With my previous experience, I’ll be fine as long as I’m careful. It’s enough as long as I can fly across the mountain valley with my Self-Driving Fort.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned. “Self-Driving Forts can fly now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone laughed when they heard him ask that. He Caitou chuckled and said, “Of course they can fly. Furthermore, we even gave them an apt name… Flying Pigs!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was speechless.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Calling them Flying Pigs is indeed very apt. All-Terrain Self-Driving Forts are very round. If they fly in the air, they will indeed seem like pigs. It’s just that if Teacher Xuan learns about this nickname…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao laughed, “Alright, Yuhao just came back. Let’s not talk about that, let’s eat first. I’ll go to the kitchen to take a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone sat down around a table. Not only was this a place for them to hold meetings, but it was also a place for them to dine together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei looked at Huo Yuhao and asked, “Yuhao, who are you thinking of bringing along with you? Apart from Sanshi and Nannan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Me, me too!” Before he even finished speaking, a voice already sounded eagerly. When Huo Yuhao turned his head to look, he saw Nan Qiuqiu sitting somewhere further away. She stretched out her hands with all her strength and looked very impatient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head speechlessly and said, “I wouldn’t dare to bring you along. You can remain in the Tang Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu was displeased. “Why? Am I that weak? I’m a six-ringed Soul Emperor. Bring me along.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi, who was sitting beside her, said, “I want to go, too. We’ll listen to your instructions when we are performing missions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them looked at Huo Yuhao and seemed very eager. They had been cultivating in the Tang Sect since the beast tide. They couldn’t help out much in terms of the Tang Sect’s daily matters. They were both young ladies, and thus they were very bored as time passed. Huo Yuhao was about to go on another mission after returning this time, and they were extremely eager as they volunteered themselves. As for whatever other intentions they harbored, only they themselves knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow. In terms of abilities, Nan Qiuqiu and Ye Guyi were rather good. They were both Soul Emperors now, and their martial souls were very special. Nan Qiuqiu’s martial soul was of the Annihilation Element, while Ye Guyi’s martial soul was of the Holy Element. They were both very effective at dealing with evil soul masters. Naturally, it would be great if they could tag along. However, the two of them weren’t like the rest of them in the Tang Sect. It was very possible for them to get themselves into trouble. Under such circumstances, Huo Yuhao didn’t know whether it was a good idea to bring them along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei said from one side, “Just bring them along. It’ll be beneficial for them if they can venture outside. However, Qiuqiu and Guyi, I have something that I have to say to the both of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei turned serious and said, “This mission isn’t an ordinary one. It concerns your lives. The both of you must think about it carefully. At the same time, you must listen to Yuhao’s instructions outside. Otherwise, the Tang Sect won’t be able to keep you. I hope you understand what I’m saying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu flattened her lips. She wanted to say that he was biased, but she didn’t dare to. Ye Guyi tugged her slightly and nodded. She said seriously, “Eldest senior, don’t worry. We’ll definitely listen to Huo Yuhao’s arrangements when we’re outside. We won’t make trouble for him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei’s expression turned much friendlier, and he replied, “That’s great!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We want to go too.” Jing Ziyan, who was sitting to one side, raised her hand. She also tugged at Ji Juechen, who was beside her. Ji Juechen nodded strongly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was much less worried about the two of them. He smiled and said, “Great! Brother Ji and Sister Ziyan, come along too. However, eldest senior, I’m going to take so many people with me. What about things over here…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei smiled and said, “Things will be fine here. The few of them won’t be able to help me much even if they remain here. I won’t have to be so worried if Brother Ji leaves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen didn’t have any expression on his face even after Bei Bei mocked him. He only looked at Huo Yuhao seriously. Even though he didn’t say anything, Huo Yuhao could roughly guess what he was thinking. He sighed helplessly. He wasn’t against sparring with Ji Juechen. Someone like Ji Juechen putting pressure on him was actually very beneficial to his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei nodded and said, “This is it, then. Sanshi, Nannan, Ziyan, Brother Ji, Qiuqiu and Guyi, all of you will follow Yuhao to the Star Luo Empire’s front line. He will be the one commanding all of you on this mission. You must all listen to his instructions. Tomorrow, we’ll follow him into the Great Star Dou Forest first, before you all set off. Yuhao, do you have anything to add?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head.</span></p>
