No wonder, he can actually interact with the heavens and the earth. He’s quite &nbsp;impressive – that’s a pity, because he’s not a good guy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong had firmly branded Huo Yuhao as “not a good person” ever since the first time he had hugged her. At least, her impression hadn’t changed much for now, and several adjectives could be added, at most... he was a scoundrel who had extraordinary abilities! Or, he was a scoundrel who possessed some strength...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both guys and girls couldn’t help but feel interested and curious about the unknown or mysterious things. Huo Yuhao was like that to Tang Wutong, and she was starting to feel interested and curious about him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person seems to have uncountable hidden secrets. Furthermore, those secrets seem to have something to do with me...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong wasn’t stupid. More accurately, she was incredibly intelligent. She had already heard of Huo Yuhao when she first came to Shrek Academy, because everyone believed that she and Huo Yuhao should be together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was furious at the beginning, and figured that everyone in Shrek Academy had gone insane. But with the passage of time and more and more people saying the same thing, she could faintly feel that.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps someone that looks like me is related to that fellow. But can someone really look like me?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She knew that she didn’t have a good temper, and if someone else did what he had done, she would probably have fought with that person until one of them dropped dead. When she first encountered Huo Yuhao, even though she had lashed out at him because she was angry, she couldn’t feel any lethal intent in her heart at all during her attack. She even felt a little soft during the fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t understand why that had happened, but her heart seemed to soften uncontrollably when she looked at that fellow’s eyes. This was the same even when she had labelled him a scoundrel, and it seemed like there really was some connection between the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong found all that hard to believe, because this person had never appeared before in her memory! It was even more impossible that they were acquainted or had any interactions either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She shook her head forcefully, and her wavy pinkish-blue hair fluttered in the sky behind her.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’m not going to think about him anymore. I’ll just ignore him in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was thinking like that to herself, but she still couldn’t help but look at him. She stared at his tall and slim figure flying in front of her, and she felt the gentle soul power undulations that were spreading from his body. For some reason, she couldn’t shift her eyes away…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">-------</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They flew for about two hours before Huo Yuhao suggested for everyone to come down and rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had entered the Star Luo Empire’s borders, and needed at least another two hours before they reached the Star Luo Empire’s western regions. They would be very close to the front lines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had started out very early in the morning, so they were a little hungry when they descended to the ground. They retrieved their respective rations and drinking water and began eating their own meals, and everyone rested at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan were in a jovial mood. They had just become Soul Sages, and flying through the air without any soul tools felt fantastic!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One’s soul power rose exponentially after one became a Soul Sage, and the Soul Sage could unleash his or her martial soul true body. The Soul Sage would also experience a qualitative leap in fighting strength. They were gifted and elite students from Shrek Academy in the first place, and they had just become some of the strongest individuals of the younger generation after they became Soul Sages. They had also closed the gap between Huo Yuhao and themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t go over to Tang Wutong’s side. He believed that even if Tang Wutong had lost her memory, she would have Dong’er’s personality from before, and him taking the initiative to get closer to her wouldn’t result in anything good. Furthermore, he wasn’t worried at all. For some reason, he was starting to enjoy the feeling of gradually awakening Dong’er’s memories. He had a made a decision in his heart long ago.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;If I can’t make Dong’er remember me, then I will let her fall in love with me all over again.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter what happened, he wouldn’t leave her side this time, and he would follow her wherever she went.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their priority now was to execute their mission. Huo Yuhao munched on his rations as he contemplated in silence.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Should I directly reveal my identity to the White Tiger Duke on this journey to the front lines? It’s quite inevitable that I’ll run into Dai Luoli when I’m there. I wonder if that fellow has sold me out yet?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Probably not. Luoli has some stubbornness in his personality, and he’s not one to compromise easily. Hopefully the White Tiger Duke won’t see through everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An indescribable discomfort arose in Huo Yuhao’s heart when he considered looking for the White Tiger Duke directly, according to Elder Xuan’s instructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some time ago, he could have confessed his feelings and thoughts to Wang Dong’er, at least. But now? Who could he talk to? He could only silently endure this heavy burden by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took a deep breath, and placed his rations down before he closed his eyes and started to rest, leaning against a large tree behind him. Even he didn’t know what to do at this moment, even with his extraordinary intelligence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Elder Xuan hadn’t given him instructions, he would have returned to Dai Luoli’s side and continued serving as Xu Yun’s personal guard. He believed that with his abilities and strength, he would be continuously promoted if he participated in battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just as Elder Xuan had said, his strength would undoubtedly be wasted if he did that. He could participate directly in the war and be a lot more effective than otherwise. His Spiritual Detection could reach an extraordinary distance, just how much help could he give the Star Luo Empire?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Forget it… I can’t affect the entire empire just because of my desires and wishes!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Huo Yuhao had never thought that the Star Luo Empire had given anything to him at all, it was still his home country.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’m just going to look for the White Tiger Duke directly. He doesn’t know who I am, anyway, and I’ll work hard to help the Star Luo Empire resolve their troubles before anything else. I can use other methods in the future to realize my wish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao finally reconciled his thoughts, and he exhaled deeply as he opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he opened his eyes, he was met with two large pinkish-blue eyes staring at him, which startled him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His mind and his energy were too concentrated before this, to the point where he didn’t release his spiritual power. At this moment, he couldn’t help but feel a little dazed when he suddenly saw Tang Wutong’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the shadow that had just arisen in Huo Yuhao’s heart vanished into thin air when he saw her. As long as she was around, any trouble or challenge didn’t seem like much of a problem anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled at Tang Wutong and nodded gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong immediately turned away, and she chomped down on her rations forcefully, as if she were eating his flesh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao finished his food before he crossed his legs in a proper sitting position and started to meditate. Even though his cultivation speed was already incredible, his hard working attitude and the habits that he had formed over the years never changed.</span></p>

Of course, they could do this because they were inside the Star Luo Empire. If they had been inside the Sun Moon Empire, there would still have been hordes of surveillance soul tools blanketing these regions, and they would have been quickly discovered.</span></p>

There, they were quickly met with blockades.</span></p>

The Star Luo Empire soul engineers that had stopped them told them that the entire western border was locked down, and nobody could fly in or out. Otherwise, they could very easily be attacked. The company had no choice but to descend to the ground and move forward on foot.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao thought for a moment and said, “Forget that. The front lines are very jittery and jumpy right now, and the Star Luo Empire is very sensitive. What if they treat us like spies again, and interrogate us? Why don’t we pick up the pace and go directly to the front lines? I know where the White Tiger Duke’s base is. We can rest again when we’re there.”</span></p>

Even though they couldn’t fly, they only needed two hours at most to reach the frontlines with their abilities and strength.</span></p>

Let’s rest for a little while and have something to eat before setting out.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao found this creek with his spiritual power. The men didn’t feel much about this creek, but when the ladies saw this clear and transparent stream, they all exclaimed joyously at the same time and pounced at the stream. They all squatted beside the stream and washed their hands and faces, and were very happy.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao, Xu Sanshi, and Ji Juechen were the only men in their company, while Ji Juechen was an enigma, and didn’t like to talk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In contrast, there were five women: Tang Wutong, Ye Guyi, Nan Qiuqiu, Jing Ziyan, and Jiang Nannan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan’s looks were slightly inferior to the others. The four other girls were exceptionally pretty and beautiful, though Jing Ziyan could also be considered delicate and pretty.</span></p>

These colors reflected off the stream and shone onto the girls’ faces. This glow brought out everyone’s charming looks even more. Their cheeks and faces were red and rosy, and looked incredibly enchanting.</span></p>

He swallowed audibly before nudging Huo Yuhao beside him and said, “Little junior brother, can you tell that Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqi both seem to be interested in you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh?” Huo Yuhao was momentarily stunned. He had guessed that Ye Guyi seemed to have some feelings for him, but Nan Qiuqiu…</span></p>

He didn’t sense anything about other things at all!</span></p>
