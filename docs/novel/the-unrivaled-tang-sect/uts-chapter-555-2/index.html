 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, do you know how happy I am? This is my first time feeling your love for me. This is already enough for me. Stay happy with Dong’er. Whether she’s Dong’er or Tang Wutong, she’s your greatest love. I’m only a part of what you truly love. When I first transformed myself into her, I’d already lost. I can’t beat her, ever. I love you, but she loves you more. You have a little crush for me, but your entire heart belongs to her. This is already the best result. Don’t be as sad. This is the future. I’ll be even sadder if you’re like this. When you miss me, you can hug Wutong. If you’re together with her, it’ll be like you and I are together. You, me and her are no longer separable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was in a daze as he listened to Wang Qiu’er. He finally understood why Dong’er’s martial soul experienced such a mutation after she became Tang Wutong, and how she was able to use the Golden Spear. It turned out that Wang Qiu’er’s strength was indeed in her body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qiu’er, you’ve sacrificed too much for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Qiu’er smiled and said, “Before I sacrificed myself for you, weren’t you willing to sacrifice your own life for me? Even though you were in despair then, I was still very satisfied. Yuhao, I love you. You must take care of yourself. Remember, I’m always by your side. I’m always here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, she lifted her hand and gently caressed Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny, as well as his entire forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! That was where the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s Skull of Destiny was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dim gold separated from Tang Wutong’s body and re-fused into Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao only sensed an indescribable gentleness sweeping over him, relieving the pain and sorrow in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was still in his arms. She didn’t get up. Huo Yuhao’s tears also stopped flowing.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! Qiu’er has always been inside my body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Forever!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s tears finally dried up, and he lowered his head to look at the person in his arms. He gently touched her long, wavy, pinkish-blue hair. Huo Yuhao finally called, “Wutong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong lifted her head and gave him a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry!” Huo Yuhao said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong glared at him. “I need to punish you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Warm, smooth red lips touched his own. That gentle touch and fragrance mixed with the love of Wang Dong’er and Wang Qiu’er immediately reminded Huo Yuhao of everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next instant, golden light shone brightly, and Huo Yuhao flew up. He drew a beautiful arc in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His flying-type soul tool opened up behind him. He poured out his soul power and managed to stabilize himself in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed that Wang Dong’er still minded his relationship with Wang Qiu’er. However, he felt overwhelmingly ecstatic when he was kissed. At that instant, he could sense two different sets of love.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He controlled his body in the air, and his eyes had already become clear by now. Tang Wutong gazed deeply at him. He chuckled and flew back beside Tang Wutong, holding her hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The world of humans is indeed very complex. I didn’t expect you to obtain the love of the Emperor Beast!” The low-pitched voice from before let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you believe me now?” Huo Yuhao asked. The greatest pain and sorrow in his heart had been invoked, but he had managed to see Wang Qiu’er. He finally understood everything. This wasn’t just pain to him; it was an escape too. It made his spiritual awareness much clearer as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, so what are you here for?” The voice asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pondered for a moment before saying, “I have a very important friend. She was affected by evil soul masters. She suffered critical injuries. Her martial soul is a Bluesilver Grass. If we want her to recover, she’ll need your power. That’s why I hope we can get a leaf from you. Of course, I won’t take it for nothing. You can list your conditions. As long as I can fulfil them, I’ll do my best. I only want to make an exchange.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That low-pitched voice went silent for a moment. “You are very strong. I can sense a lot of danger from your body. You also have the help of the Emperor Beast. You can defeat me easily and take me back. Why do you not do that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I swore I’d never attack a soul beast unless I’m trying to defend myself, Huo Yuhao replied sincerely, “That’s why I only want to make an exchange with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The voice was astonished. “As a human soul master, you actually swore not to kill soul beasts?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Yes! After I established Spirits, I could avoid killing soul beasts to obtain their powers.” He described what Spirits were, and even released the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass was also a plant-type soul beast. It had the most acute senses when it came to other plant-type soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, the voice became much gentler after he saw the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass and heard Huo Yuhao’s story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks for thinking for soul beasts. Just based on this, I think I can help you. However, I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke until here, he went silent for a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s heart tightened. He had finally found this Bluesilver Emperor. If he was unwilling, Huo Yuhao couldn’t force him at all because of his vow.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What should I do if that’s the case? Teacher Xiao Ya is still waiting for him to save her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you have any difficulties, you can tell me. If possible, I’ll do my best to help you.” Although Huo Yuhao knew that he was being very rushed, he was aware that there was no room for mistakes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That low-pitched voice sighed and said, “I’ve already lived in this world for a hundred and ninety thousand years. However, I’m still only a Bluesilver Grass. Even though I’m already an Emperor, I still can’t overcome the heavenly punishment that’s about to come due to my innate abilities. That’s why I’m about to die. Perhaps, your plan can bring me new life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was delighted when heard this. However, he still asked, “However, you can choose to be reborn. Can’t soul beasts choose to be reborn when they reach a bottleneck?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are mistaken. That’s only at the hundred thousand year mark. After that, you can’t take that path anymore if you don’t choose to be reborn after a certain period of time. I’m already close to the two hundred thousand year stage. That’s why I can’t do it anymore. Perhaps some powerful soul beasts can think of another way. However, I can’t do that, because of my own lineage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was only enlightened now. A Bluesilver Grass would still face problems with its lineage even if it became a Bluesilver Emperor. Under such a circumstance, it would be unable to be like the Snow Empress – able to be reborn even if its cultivation was very high. It sounded logical too. Given the Snow Empress’ talent as the Icesky Snow Lady and seven hundred thousand year cultivation, she could only choose to be reborn as an embryo, which eventually led to a catastrophe. She eventually became Huo Yuhao’s Spirit. Compared to the Snow Empress, the Bluesilver Emperor’s cultivation was far inferior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “As long as you are willing, it’s not a problem. I can bring you back to fuse with my friend. Don’t worry, my friend is incredibly talented. She’s only two years older than me, but she already has eight rings. If you can give her a ninth soul ring in the near future, I believe she’ll become one of the strongest humans.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I shall trouble you then.” The Bluesilver Emperor said satisfactorily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Bluesilver Grass in the valley started to shake. They weren’t fearful and hostile this time. Rather, they were excited and agitated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao seemed to sense the presence of giant pythons slithering over from all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blue vines started to rise up, and they eventually gathered together. Every vine appeared smooth and transparent. They were clear like blue crystals. However, there seemed to be veins inside these vines, and these veins seemed to be moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vines quickly wrapped around one another, and formed the appearance of a human. This human nodded at Huo Yuhao before moving towards him. It revolved around him and gradually adopted the entire form of a human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this human form wasn’t the manifestation of a savage beast, but the product of vines twisting around one another. It was as if it had been woven. The originally thick vines also shrank too. They were only as thick as human thumbs now. It appeared very strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll follow you.” The Bluesilver Emperor said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded at him and said, “Thanks for your trust.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bluesilver Emperor pursed his lips and seemed to be smiling. “In fact, I believe in the Emperor Beast’s taste. She can’t be wrong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was a little curious as she looked at the Bluesilver Emperor. Right now, she fully understood why Huo Yuhao was here. It was just that there was an extra special look in her eyes when she looked at the Bluesilver Emperor.</span></p>

At the same time, he extended his Spiritual Antenna towards the Bluesilver Emperor.</span></p>
