It released waves of heat that maintained a certain temperature around the Icefire Yin Yang Well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After letting out a breath, Huo Yuhao slowly retracted his aura, and his eyes slowly brightened. He thought of something and raised his right hand. A strange stalk of icy-blue grass surfaced in his hand. It was a smaller version of the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao revealed a delighted smile after sensing the difference it brought to his body.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chuckled and said, “This proves that a hundred-thousand-year Spirit is indeed very effective. Eldest senior, you must work harder in your cultivation.” As he spoke, he scanned his surroundings and looked at the rest of the plants around the Icefire Yin Yang Well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei smiled and said, “A Spirit has to be willing to complete a contract. Let’s go, little junior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao looked at all the medicinal herbs and said, “Guys, the Star Anise has already fused with me and become my Spirit. All of you should be able to sense the condition that he’s in right now. I won’t say anything else. Goodbye.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, Huo Yuhao and Bei Bei used their flying-type soul tools and flew out of the mountain valley before the poisonous miasma could return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

All the medicinal herbs that had their own consciousness became very thoughtful right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was right. After fusing with him, the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass was different. Even though he had abandoned his body, his aura had become extremely pure. After fusing with Huo Yuhao, Huo Yuhao wasn’t the only who benefitted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had formed an equal contract! The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass also completed his evolution under the influence of Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice. He turned from a plant to an energy body, and he even became an extremely pure energy body. The change in his aura greatly tempted all the plant-type soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were even more moved by the fact that Huo Yuhao mentioned he might become a God, and could give his Spirits eternal life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to animal-type soul beasts, plant-type soul beasts were much lonelier. Before they possessed their own intelligence, they couldn’t move at all. Even a hundred-thousand-year plant-type soul beast was unwilling to leave the Icefire Yin Yang Well, as it was too reliant on it. The poisonous miasmas of the Jade Phosphorous Flowers of the Seven and Nine Absolutes also covered the area outside the well. Apart from the Delicate Silk Immortal, the other immortal and medicinal herbs couldn’t leave the well even if they wanted to. This was an important reason why You You was able to take charge of the well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Ice Grass made his decision, all the plant-type soul beasts were shocked. However, they were all moved after he completed his fusion with Huo Yuhao and managed to evolve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was able to leave this place and proceed to the human world with a human soul master. He could also experience the beauty of the human world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He might even have a chance to attain eternal life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These weren’t the biggest reason why they were moved, however. They were most moved by the fact that the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass managed to evolve into an extremely pure energy state. In that way, he could regrow using that pure energy even if Huo Yuhao died! Furthermore, his cultivation would only become stronger. All of the plants here were very valuable, formed after absorbing the origin energy of heaven and earth. If they went through everything that the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass went through, and the soul masters that fused with them died, they could still reabsorb their origin energy. It wouldn’t be very difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the atmosphere in the Icefire Yin Yang Well was no longer peaceful. All the plant-type soul beasts with their own intelligence, especially the hundred-thousand-year soul beasts, started to become very restless…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao knew what they were thinking. After he completed his fusion with the Ice Grass, the Ice Grass told him about how he was unable to live independently. He didn’t conceal anything from Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Plant-type soul beasts were greatly disadvantaged compared to animal-type soul beasts. However, they had their own advantages, which was that they were purely nurtured from the origin energy of heaven and earth. They didn’t have any bloodlines; they only had spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress, Skydream Iceworm, and Snow Empress were all stronger than the Star Anise. However, they were bound to die if Huo Yuhao died, as they would lose their only source of energy. However, the Star Anise would be able to continue living based on his close connection to the origin energy of heaven and earth. This was the advantage of a plant. The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass was already satisfied even though he had only been fused for such a short period of time. Yes, he was extremely satisfied. Furthermore, his future was going to be extremely bright. Perhaps he might really gain eternal life?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass was the quietest among all the medicinal herbs in the Icefire Yin Yang Well. However, he was also the wisest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It might seem his decision to follow Huo Yuhao was very sudden. However, he had in fact pondered it meticulously. Huo Yuhao didn’t hesitate to swallow the water from the Blazing Sunspring to save his loved one and almost lost his life. After going through countless tests from the Delicate Silk Immortal and the Blazing Delicate Apricot, the qualities that he demonstrated proved that he was one of the most outstanding humans in terms of character and abilities. Along with the temptation of Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice, the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass knew that his decision was unlikely to backfire on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Huo Yuhao and the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass were winners after this fusion. In terms of Spirit Fusion, a win-win situation was always the best start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei wasn’t surprised. He smiled and said, “You are going to find Dong’er, am I right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and replied, “Yes! It’s been so long. I wonder how she’s doing. I’ve done most of the things I was supposed to do. I’m going to see her now. When you return, you can also communicate with the soul beasts through the Spirit Pagoda. Bi Ji is a nice soul beast to talk to. Ask her for help seeking out the Bluesilver Emperor. After I finish visiting Dong’er, I might go to the border between the Star Luo Empire and Sun Moon Empire. At the same time, I’ll try to find out where Teacher Xiao Ya is. If possible, I’ll save her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei took a deep breath and opened his arms wide, hugging Huo Yuhao tightly. “You are my good brother. I’ll skip the thanks between us. Don’t worry about the Tang Sect. If there’s anything you need, send a letter back. No matter what your choices are, the Tang Sect will always be your ardent backer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them separated like this. Huo Yuhao watched as Bei Bei disappeared into the distance. After he saw him off, he turned around and peered in the direction that he was going to go. He muttered to himself, “I can finally live for myself. Dong’er, have you awoken? I’m coming!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blinding lights shone from Huo Yuhao’s body, and he released his soul power without reservation. His speed increased to its maximum as he powered his flying-type soul tool, shooting towards the Clear Sky Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had settled most of the things that he was supposed to settle. Right now, he was set on going home. He couldn’t wait to get to the Clear Sky Sect, and hoped that Wang Dong’er would be standing at the gate, waiting to receive him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that Wang Dong’er was unlikely to have awoken. Otherwise, she would have returned to Shrek Academy to find him! But right now, he hoped that the two sect leaders of the Clear Sky Sect had grounded her, and hadn’t allowed her to find him, instead of her still being in a deep sleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could finally go find her after completing the other matters that he had to attend to. Right now, Huo Yuhao was in a state where he was ready to unleash his Three Ultimate Haodong Skills at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

It wasn’t just because he didn’t rest at all, and was drained. It was also because he was nervous.</span></p>

This was simply too important to him. No matter how resilient or mature he was, he still had a weak spot, and that weak spot was Wang Dong’er.</span></p>

He prayed that Wang Dong’er would be awake, and could be by his side again. He didn’t care about anything else. If she wasn’t awake, he wouldn’t leave easily even if the two sect leaders forced him to leave. He wanted to accompany her.</span></p>

Following this, Huo Yuhao could sense the clouds around him moving. It felt like everything was changing.</span></p>
