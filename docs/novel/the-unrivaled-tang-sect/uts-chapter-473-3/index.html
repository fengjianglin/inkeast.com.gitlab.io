 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King’s eyes immediately softened when he heard her. He nudged his enormous nose against the Snow Empress body and said, “Snow Empress, Snow Empress... what am I to do, exactly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress heaved a sigh and said, “You will just follow me from now on. I can feel you are not far from your third bottleneck, and you only have a thirty percent chance of breaking through it. If I’m still around to protect you, perhaps you will be able to make it, but there’s no way I can stay here to help you. Therefore, I hope that you can choose a different path with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King clearly didn’t really understand the meaning of the Snow Empress’ words. He stared at her in confusion, and didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress continued, “You will understand if you follow me after this. The path that I am looking at is one to become a God. If I am successful, then we will transcend this world, and we will no longer be threatened or affected by it. If we fail, then we have a chance to choose another. In the Douluo Continent, no matter how strong us soul beasts are individually, there is no way we can touch the God Realm. It is the rule of this world. Di Tian is sufficiently powerful, but he still has no way of breaking this curse. If he can’t, then I can’t, and neither can you. Therefore, we can only attach ourselves to the strongest person in this world, and perhaps that person that will reach the God Realm, and only then can we leave this world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know about all that, Snow Empress, but I will follow you, whatever you say.” The Ice Bear King used the most direct method to express his trust in the Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress turned around and waved at Huo Yuhao. “Come here, Yuhao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hurriedly step forward and came to the Snow Empress’ side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled and said, “Little Bai, let me introduce you. This is my father.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was still digesting the shock and astonishment that he harbored towards the Snow Empress, and he didn’t know why she was calling him over. However, his entire being froze like a rock when she said that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Father… What did she just call me? Father…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was completely motionless at this point, as if his spiritual sea had turned into ice. More importantly, the Snow Empress’ expression was extremely calm and casual when she said those words, as if she were describing something very normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t the only one; the Ice Bear King’s expression was equally lackadaisical. There seemed to be a trail of snot flowing from his giant nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Father…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That term was equally unfamiliar to him. He didn’t know who his father was. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been taken away by the Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But why would this term,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">father,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">appear in the Snow Empress’ mouth!? The Snow Empress... she actually has a father? She has been alive for more than seven hundred thousand years, and she’s one of the oldest living beings in the world. How old does her father have to be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress stared at the human and soul beast, who were both stunned speechless and motionless. She couldn’t help but laugh, and it wasn’t just a grin, because she was laughing particularly happily. This was especially so when she was looking at Huo Yuhao, because it was evident that there was some teasing in her smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress wasn’t too far away from them, but she couldn’t laugh at all. Her eyes were opened wide as her jaw hung open; she hadn’t expected such words to come from the Snow Empress’ mouth, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Daddy, what’s wrong?” The Snow Empress stared at Huo Yuhao with a captivating smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao swallowed forcibly before he pointed at himself and said, “You… you’re calling me? You can’t make a joke like this, Snow Empress!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress rolled her eyes and said, “Who’s joking with you? I am calling you. Why, do you not dare to acknowledge me? Have you forgotten? I have just passed my crown as the ruler of the Extreme North to Ah Tai, and since that moment, I am no longer queen in this place. I am no longer the Snow Empress: I am the Snow Lady, the Snow Lady that you have always protected, and the Snow Lady that has been growing up little by little.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Never in his wildest dreams did he expect such a tremendous turnaround. He was just feeling sad about the distance between the Snow Empress and himself when she gave him such an enormous pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress’ eyes grew tender. “Yuhao, I have recovered my memory, but everything that happened when we were together has long been imprinted in my memory in the period that my old memory was lost. I will never forget all the times that we have shared together, and in my heart, you are my father. This has nothing to do with age, and it’s just a sentiment. Yes, it’s just a sentiment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her eyes grew a little sadder as she paused. “Did you know? I was all alone when I came into this world, and this loneliness made my personality cold and icy. I am the Icesky Snow Lady that the heavens have nurtured and brought into this world, but even though the weakest soul beasts in the Extreme North have their own parents, I have no parents. Rather, the Extreme North is my parent. I have never experienced parental warmth or kindness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But I’ve felt that from you. I can feel the love and care that you have for me. When I’m with you, even if you’re just staring at me with a tender and amiable gaze, it makes me very happy. Even though I had yet to regain my memory back then, once I regained my memory, I realized that the period when I was with you was the happiest and most blissful part of my life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Therefore, I consider you my father in my heart, and that will never change. Ever since I’ve recovered my memory over these days, I can feel the worry in your heart. You don’t have to fear anything. I am the Snow Empress, but I am your Snow Lady even more. I am more than willing to be your Snow Lady! Daddy, are you willing to accept me as your daughter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corner of Huo Yuhao’s mouth began to twitch.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Daughter… the Snow Empress, the Icesky Snow Lady, third amongst the Ten Great Savage Beasts, and a soul beast with seven hundred thousand years of cultivation… Gods! What has happened to this world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he was full of yearning towards the Snow Empress before this, his first reaction when the Snow Empress was standing in front of him and saying to him plainly that she wanted to be his daughter wasn’t happiness; he could almost feel his nose bleeding. That was just…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress pouted and said, “Daddy, do you not want me anymore? Then I will become a child with no home to return to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress was incredibly gorgeous from the beginning. Everything came from her heart, and even though she seemed like a lady who had grown up, her voice, eyes, and tone were no different from the little Snow Lady back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course I do!” Huo Yuhao sputtered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, then!” The Snow Empress giggled as she pranced forward and wrapped her arms around Huo Yuhao’s arm. “I have been trying too hard to pretend after I’ve recovered my memory. I would rather be the Snow Lady. More accurately, the memory that belongs to the Snow Lady has allowed me to find myself. I am a little reluctant to give away my position as the ruler of the Extreme North, but now I feel as if I have been liberated, and all my responsibilities are no more. I will live my life happily from today onwards, and that feeling is just fantastic. Isn’t that right, daddy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao really wanted to ask her if she could stop calling him that. After all, they looked like they were of the same age! The Snow Empress calling him that just made him feel very strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress’ voice came from behind her. “Snow, you… you’re calling him father. What about me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress turned around and giggled at the Ice Empress. “I don’t care about that. I have already found you your lover, Ice. Don’t worry, we can do things differently. You have been addressing him by his name, anyway. It hasn’t been easy for me to find this familial love, Ice. Aren’t you happy for me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, of course I am happy,” the Ice Empress forced a laugh. “But this sudden change of events does make me feel a little weird.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress chortled and said, “There’s nothing weird about this. I am still me, and I am still the same Snow in your heart. Everything is fine if that hasn’t changed. Little Bai, what are you waiting for? Hurry up and greet your grandfather. Haven’t you always wanted me to be your mother? Alright, I am willing to accept you as my son.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grand… grandfather…” The Ice Bear King stared at Huo Yuhao with blank eyes. He could definitely tell that Huo Yuhao was a human. But the Snow Empress, whom he had endless respect for, actually called a human such as this her father. That… that was just…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt incredibly peculiar. He suddenly had a daughter today, and she felt like a very formal one, and now he had a grandson. He wasn’t even married yet! He didn’t know if he should laugh or cry. Everything was just so peculiar, but he couldn’t not recognize the Snow Empress as his daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s a good boy,” The Snow Empress patted the Ice Bear King on his nose, and she waved her right hand across the air and pointed. A dark blue ice crystal hovered in front of the Ice Bear King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is your grandfather’s gift to you.”</span></p>
