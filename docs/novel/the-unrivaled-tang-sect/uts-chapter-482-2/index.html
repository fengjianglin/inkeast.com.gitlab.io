 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao also laughed. “Yes! Even if we die, we will die fighting. I’m very honored to experience this battle with you. At the very least, we are the rare few in the continent who have battled Ultimate Douluo one after another.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong released his arm and patted him gently on his shoulder. “Don’t worry, I’ll protect you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao rolled his eyes and said, “You, protect me? More like I’ll protect you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as they were talking, the dark air around them suddenly stabilized as their surroundings became clear once more, and sound returned, along with sight. However, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were both momentarily stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were no longer outside the Heavenly Soul Empire’s royal palace. There wasn’t a single trace of urbanization; they were clearly somewhere in the wilderness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What did that mean? It meant that the Darkness Holy Dragon had used his own strength to bring them both out of Heaven Dou City into the wilderness. That was just unbelievable. This was an Ultimate Douluo’s power! Perhaps he didn’t yet have the Beast God’s ability to pierce through spacetime, but even then, to be able to bring them both to this place unwittingly within such a short period of time was far beyond Huo Yuhao’s understanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Emperor Douluo smiled as he watched their stern expressions. “What’s wrong? Are you afraid?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong grunted contemptuously. “Afraid? What’s there to be afraid of? You’ve just been alive for a few more years than we have. If we had lived in the same generation, you might be afraid of us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes!” Long Xiaoyao laughed, “You’re right. If we were in the same generation, I may not have been able to defeat you. You are prodigies of your generation, but I was also a prodigy back then. Now that I think about it, I feel like two hundred years is right before my eyes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A tinge of sorrow appeared in his eyes as he spoke. He nodded gently in Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao’s direction and said, “Come, the two of you can team up. Let me see what kind of fighting strength you prodigious youngsters can achieve. Don’t think of escaping, because that’s absolutely impossible. Fight with your full strength. Warriors who die on the battlefield die an honorable death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong glanced at each other, and each saw the other’s determination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took a slow step forward, and his Eye of Destiny gradually opened on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong didn’t fight with him for point position. Instead, she took a step back and stood behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their martial souls were unleashed at almost the same time, and seven soul rings swiftly rose into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao unleashed his Spirit Eyes. Seven soul rings that were completely out of the ordinary swiftly appeared, the most eye-catching one his blood-red soul ring, which appeared at the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Spirit Eyes’ sixth soul ring came from Wang Qiu’er. The soul ring that she had given him was very special, and rose-gold in color. It didn’t share the same color as normal soul rings, but with his Eye of Destiny instead. His seventh soul ring came from a hundred-thousand-year Evileye Tyrant, and it was also red. These two soul rings were the most glaring amongst his seven soul rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao began to release his formidable soul power, and his entire being seemed to faintly contort. He didn’t move immediately, but was just standing there quietly as he stared at Long Xiaoyao. His seven soul rings glowed one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao seemed surprised when he saw Huo Yuhao’s seven soul rings. This was the first time that he had seen such a combination. However, the soul rings that he was looking at didn’t include the hundred-thousand-year soul ring at the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though it was a hundred-thousand-year &nbsp;soul ring, this arrangement was very normal. One of the two soul rings that attracted his attention was Huo Yuhao’s rose-gold ring, his sixth one, which was filled with the power of destiny. The other one was his white soul ring, his first one, which looked like it was no different from a ten year soul ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How powerful was the Darkness Holy Dragon, the Dragon Emperor Douluo? This white ring looked like a ten year soul ring in normal people’s eyes, but that wasn’t the case to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very clear on what ten year soul rings were like. They were white, but they radiated a drastically different aura. Even though the soul power in Huo Yuhao’s ten year soul ring was completely contained, along with its aura, Huo Yuhao’s white soul ring had a smoothness that ten year soul rings didn’t have. Faint golden patterns could be seen on its surface, and that was absolutely something that ten year soul rings couldn’t achieve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There’s something wrong with this kid’s soul rings!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t hasty to make his move at all. He was just standing there like a statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very smart!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Long Xiaoyao praised Huo Yuhao in his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kid knows that I, with my status, will never take the initiative to attack him without him making a move first. He wants to raise his aura and his abilities to their highest possible level before attacking me.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But would that really be effective?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny gradually opened on his forehead. Rose-gold sun patterns of the stretched in all directions with his Eye of Destiny in the middle. His eyes slowly closed, like he was using his Eye of Destiny to view the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light in his Eye of Destiny was crystal clear. Even Long Xiaoyao felt like his Eye of Destiny possessed a strange gravitational force when he took but one look, as if this eye was going to consume his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rose-gold patterns glowed as dense spiritual undulations strengthened at an incredible speed. Long Xiaoyao wasn’t particularly concerned in the beginning, but an astonished expression quickly began to show on his elderly face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such formidable spiritual power. Furthermore, his spiritual power is so pure and condensed. Even the Holy Ghost Church’s evil soul masters, who use special methods to cultivate their spiritual power, can only reach such a level of spiritual power when they become Soul Douluo. How is this young man doing this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power continued to strengthen amid Long Xiaoyao’s surprise. His spiritual power wasn’t just changing quantitatively; it was also changing qualitatively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao wasn’t the only one who was astonished. Tang Wutong, who was standing behind him, was equally surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had known Huo Yuhao for quite some time, and they had fought side by side before. Back in the Ming Dou Mountain Range, the two them went deep into enemy lines together. But because of the Death God Douluo’s appearance, she didn’t see Huo Yuhao’s battle with Ye Xishui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong knew that Huo Yuhao was very strong, but she had always believed that her overall strength wasn’t inferior to his. However, she was now starting to doubt that opinion. Huo Yuhao’s continuously rising spiritual undulations were far stronger than what his cultivation rank could normally achieve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Condensed soul power gradually transformed into circles of rose-gold light. This light was very viscous, while Huo Yuhao’s body became a little blurry amid all those contorting lights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body gradually floated into the sky as his seventh blood-red soul ring flickered. Rose-gold patterns appeared behind his back, forming an image of the Three-Eyed Golden Lion. Everything within several hundred meters of him, which included the light around Long Xiaoyao, was tainted with the same colors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao sighed in amazement.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is his spiritual power close to that of a Titled Douluo’s level? No, that’s not right. His spiritual power is similar in strength to a Titled Douluo, but it is is more condensed, and is on another level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, blinding rose-gold patterns radiated all around Huo Yuhao, and his body seemed to vanish entirely within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A vertical eye that seemed material suddenly appeared in midair, and the intense spiritual power undulations rose to their highest possible level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Materialization of spiritual power!” Long Xiaoyao’s eyes grew focused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Huo Yuhao who was still sitting in a restaurant outside the royal palace suddenly dissipated as it disappeared into countless rose-gold light patterns that swiftly flew out of the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had left that spiritual avatar as his contingency plan, so that he could substitute it for his original body as he was running away to draw the soldiers chasing him away. However, this spiritual avatar lost its meaning when the Dragon Emperor Douluo appeared. As Huo Yuhao unleashed his spiritual power with his full strength, that thread of his spiritual power was immediately recalled by the Eye of the Asura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Radiant golden light transformed into an enormous pillar of light as it surged into the sky. The rose-gold vertical eye was just hovering there, and a strange whirlpool spun rapidly within the coldness of the vertical eye’s pupil. All of the space that was covered by its rose-gold light began to contort in this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the first time, a truly astonished look appeared on the Dragon Emperor Douluo’s face. He had originally believed that he was already holding Huo Yuhao in high regard, but it seemed like his judgment was far from sufficient. The spiritual power that this youth displayed far surpassed that of normal Titled Douluo, and with Long Xiaoyao’s two hundred years of experience, he was entirely sure that even Transcendent Doulou would have a hard time reaching Huo Yuhao’s level of spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Materializing spiritual power wasn’t something that happened with improving one’s soul power or cultivation rank. It was an attribute that only formidable spiritual-type soul masters could achieve. Furthermore, Long Xiaoyao could feel a soul core within Yuhao’s materialized martial soul true body! This was the core of why he was so astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a young Soul Sage, and yet he already possessed a soul core. It was even a soul core for a spiritual-type martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Brother Mu, oh Brother Mu. What kind of disciple have you taken in?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The judgement of destiny!” Huo Yuhao’s ice-cold voice echoed through the twisting space, and a golden skull appeared soundlessly above Long Xiaoyao’s head. The skull was shattered in the next moment as it transformed into countless motes of flowing light that flowed into Long Xiaoyao’s body. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even an Ultimate Douluo like Long Xiaoyao couldn’t resist the power of destiny. The darkness around him rippled vigorously, but couldn’t dispel the golden lights, and he could only allow them into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Eye of Destiny’s ability to unleash the judgement of destiny. It couldn’t decide the outcome of a battle, but it could change one’s destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao chuckled as he muttered under his breath, “I haven’t been this surprised in a long time. Interesting, very interesting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two beams of light blasted from the enormous vertical eye, one black and the other white, circling around each other and going straight for Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
