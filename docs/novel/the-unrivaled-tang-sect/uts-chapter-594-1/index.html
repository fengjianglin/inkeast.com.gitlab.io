 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I understand. Don’t worry, Wutong. In this world, only Dong’er and Qiu’er are able to walk into my heart. Right now, whether it’s Dong’er or Qiu’er, they’re in fact you. That’s why no one can affect our relationship. Yes, I once liked Ju Zi. However, that’s all in the past. Things might have been different if she was willing to be with me before I knew you were a girl. However, she didn’t; she chose to walk her own path. Thus, I already know that it’s forever impossible between us. That’s why I only treat her as a friend. If she threatens the academy one day, I’ll definitely not show any mercy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he said his last sentence, Tang Wutong could clearly sense the killing intent in him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The academy was still the most important thing in his heart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong revealed a smile on her face and asked, “What if I’m the one threatening the academy? I know it’s a stupid question, but I still want to ask you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stunned. After this, he immediately turned serious, “You can’t make jokes about that. If that day really comes, I’ll kill you too. The difference is that I’ll kill myself after I kill you—I’ll kill myself for you. In that way, I’ll protect our love and the academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry, Yuhao. I’ll not ask such a question in the future.” Tang Wutong hugged him tightly and seemed to want to alleviate his worries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao softly caressed her long hair and said, “I hope such a day never comes. I don’t think Ju Zi will do that. After all, the academy is not an empire. No matter how mad Xu Tianran is, he wouldn’t target the academy. For any ruler, the academy is the best supplier of talents. Moreover, the academy has such a long history. If someone wants to destroy it, he’ll need to consider whether it’s worth incurring the wrath of all the students of the academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong nodded and said, “Yes, we’ll all give our all if the academy is destroyed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded lightly and revealed a slight smile on his face, “Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. Let’s pick up speed. Let’s observe the situation in the Sun Moon Empire first before we decide what to do. We need to weaken Ju Zi’s abilities, but we can’t do that too much. Furthermore, the Sun Moon Empire will adapt once we make a move. Something else might happen too. That is, the Holy Ghost Church might send someone to the army. If that’s the case, it’ll get a little crowded. We just need to kill those soul engineers and plant it on the Holy Ghost Church. I’ll not have any misgivings doing that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong snapped, “You’re getting worse. Who do you think the Holy Ghost Church will send next? Will Ye Xishui personally come? There’s also Zhong Liwu. After he attacked me that day, you greatly hurt his martial soul. I wonder how he is now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Zhong Liwu’s origin must have been hurt too. Although I don’t know how critical his injuries are, they shouldn’t be light. He won’t be able to recover in a month. That’s why I believe the Holy Ghost Church can only send one person capable of striking fear into everyone’s hearts – Ye Xishui. It’s just that Ye Xishui might not be able to compare to an entire army. No matter how strong the Death God Douluo is, the Sun Moon Empire’s army might not really be afraid of her with the linked soul tools they have. Even Di Tian didn’t fare very well against them. I wonder whether his injuries have healed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong rolled her eyes and asked, “Are you concerned about him now? It’s already good that he’s not bothering you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chortled and said, “I’ll need to face him one day, even if I try to avoid him. I just hope that I can face him when I’m stronger. I can only stand at the top of this world if I defeat him. Wutong, promise me that you won’t stop me when I challenge him one day. You don’t have to help me either. I’ll use my own strength to beat him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was stunned. “But we are together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and replied, “To me, challenging Di Tian is not just a way of proving my strength. At the same time, it’s a personal mission. It’s a mission I have to complete.” In his mind, he recalled what Nian Rongbing had told him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To increase his cultivation and become a Transcendent Douluo, Huo Yuhao could clearly sense the strength of the God of Emotions getting greater and greater in his body. Perhaps it was the strength of a god.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a strength that didn’t belong to him. At least, it didn’t belong to him yet. However, it was fusing with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he summoned this strength before, it was when Tang Wutong got hurt trying to save him. He unleashed the power of emotions and fused his emotions with his fighting strength. It was an important direction that he was gearing towards in the future too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian was already at the top of the world. Even if he became an Ultimate Douluo and had a third soul core, he might still be unable to defeat Di Tian. If he wanted to beat Di Tian, he had to fuse his power with his emotions. It was only through this way that he could achieve a breakthrough and truly inherit the title of the God of Emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn’t just doing this for himself now. Becoming a god was also a route that he had to take if he wanted to free the six Spirits in his body. Furthermore, when that time came, he would definitely bring Tang Wutong along with him to the godly realm. Huo Yuhao had this thought – since Tang Wutong was so strong, he could ask Nian Rongbing to find a title for her to inherit after he became the God of Emotions. To him, Nian Rongbing shouldn’t reject his request.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought until here, Huo Yuhao suddenly felt very motivated. What was happier than knowing one’s direction in life?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao relaxed his embrace of Tang Wutong and held her hand once again. As the two of them spoke, they had already covered two hundred and fifty kilometers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, the lay of the land was presented in Huo Yuhao’s mind as he used his Spiritual Detection. Just like Jing Hongchen had described, there was a huge valley. The size of this valley was much bigger than the Icefire Yin Yang Well that they had been to before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although there were many treasures and even two wells in the Icefire Yin Yang Well, it wasn’t very huge. However, it was very different here. This valley was very large, far exceeding the size of an ordinary city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an entrance and exit at both sides of the valley. The terrain was very level. From the plants that grew here, it was evident that this was a treasure spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mountains of rocks surrounded the valley. Although they weren’t completely barren, there weren’t many plants growing on these mountains. This was why only the rocks could be seen. While they weren’t aesthetically pleasing, they were very tough. They were natural city walls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire was hiding here. It was indeed very difficult to locate them. If not for Jing Hongchen’s intelligence, Huo Yuhao wouldn’t have found them here anytime soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao used his Spiritual Detection to take a more detailed look. Indeed, there were many tents pitched in the valley. Furthermore, there were soul formations erected in four different directions, at the tops of the mountain peaks. The scale of these soul formations was rather great. It appeared that they were all helmed by beast lord-ranked soul engineer legions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who are they trying to deal with? Surely not me, right?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wondered curiously. Along with his previous guess, the answer had revealed itself to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His plan had ultimately succeeded. Internal chaos had ensued as their soul engineers killed the evil soul masters. The Holy Ghost Church was definitely going to retaliate.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I wonder how Ju Zi is going to deal with this matter. She didn’t lead the army back to the empire. That shows that she’s not willing to truly admit her mistake. As for how Xu Tianran is going to deal with this situation, I think it’s obvious. He’ll side with Ju Zi. While the Holy Ghost Church is important to the Sun Moon Empire, its primary purpose is to deal with Shrek Academy. Now that the academy is slowly not becoming the most important opponent to the empire, the Holy Ghost Church is becoming less and less important, especially after the Heavenly Soul Empire’s destruction and the increase in the Sun Moon Empire’s overall strength following the investment of a huge amount of resources. However, Ju Zi is different. Her reputation in the army is only growing. She also represents Xu Tianran’s interests. If she’s heavily punished, it’ll clash with his interests. That’s why Xu Tianran should be on her side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The furious Death God Douluo will surely be here to look for trouble. I just don’t know when she’ll appear. However, it seems like she’s not here yet. However, she wouldn’t be able to handle so many soul engineers at once even if she manages to destroy a part of their soul formations! As for where Ju Zi is, I’m afraid only she’ll know. It won’t be easy to find her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao was considering things from Ye Xishui’s perspective, rather than his own. He had his Spiritual Detection. Even if there were many times more soldiers, he would still be able to locate Ju Zi as long as he had enough time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t directly proceed to find Ju Zi. He only checked the deployment of the soldiers on the terrain, as well as the positions of all the soul formations. After this, he flew further with Tang Wutong, through a route that soldiers would have to pass in order to reinforce the army in the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was impossible to escape from Huo Yuhao’s sight given his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong asked, “How is it? What’s the deployment of soldiers like over here?”</span></p>
