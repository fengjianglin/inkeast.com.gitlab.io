 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An enormous vertical eye was hovering above his spiritual sea like a dark red sun, and its tentacles were wrapping itself around Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core. Those tentacles didn’t force their way inside, but circled around it, and the frightening spiritual undulations caused Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea to be at least twice as large. But clearly, that strength no longer belonged to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King’s aura had filled Huo Yuhao’s entire spiritual sea, and his formidable spiritual undulations almost seemed material.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The final moments were imminent, and the Evileye Tyrant King’s heart was brimming with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a long time had passed, and the Evileye Tyrant King hadn’t felt any resistance from Huo Yuhao even when he had dominated his entire spiritual sea. Huo Yuhao couldn’t possibly resist at a time like this even if he wanted to. What could Huo Yuhao use to resist the Evileye Tyrant King? Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core almost couldn’t muster any more spiritual power.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once I control his spiritual soul core and infuse my spiritual origin into it, then this possession will have reached its final stages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King was very satisfied with this body. At least, there was never any other human who had a body that could match this from his experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had a perfect body, and his element was perfect. More importantly, he was still young!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Youth was almost more important than strength for an aging soul beast who had more than seven hundred thousand years of cultivation! The Evileye Tyrant King could cultivate based on his experience if the possessed body wasn’t strong enough, but if the body wasn’t young enough, everything would be meaningless. Huo Yuhao was only a little more than twenty years old, but he was already an Ultimate Douluo, and he was going for an unprecedented third soul core. How could the Evileye Tyrant King not be satisfied with that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let it begin! Huo Yuhao, your body will belong to me after this.” The Evileye Tyrant King launched his final invasion as he laughed hysterically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark red waves surged within Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea, and the turbulent tides and frightening spiritual power reached every corner of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden patterns that were already few in number were disappearing at an alarming speed, and it wouldn’t take more than a few breaths before any traces of Huo Yuhao would vanish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the tentacles tightened, and wrapped themselves around Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core. Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core that was rotating rapidly immediately slowed because of those tentacles, and spun slower and slower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Terrifying spiritual power released immense pressure at the same time and suppressed Huo Yuhao’s soul power, not giving him a chance to turn the tables. Dark red lines and patterns began to stretch down Huo Yuhao’s neck like veins, and continued down his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vertical eye on Huo Yuhao’s forehead had completely transformed into an Evil Eye, which was very vile and sinister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The possession’s final step, domination!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s aura was almost completely undetectable in this moment, like there was nothing he could do to change anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was sitting opposite Huo Yuhao, and strangely, the corner of her mouth curved into a gentle smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King’s projection was right behind Huo Yuhao, and that enormous eye had been observing Tang Wutong from the beginning to the end. He had to pay attention to her. Even though she couldn’t stop what was happening within Huo Yuhao’s body, there was one thing she could do: she could kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body was very weak during the possession process. If Tang Wutong chose to kill him during this process, then everything the Evileye Tyrant King had done before this would have been meaningless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was an important reason why the Evileye Tyrant King didn’t hold back as he projected his spiritual power outward, and continued to monitor Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong didn’t appear like she was doing anything from the beginning to the end, like she was completely absorbed in her deep meditation. She naturally couldn’t stop what was about to happen in such a state, but why, at such a crucial moment, was she smiling?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An indescribable fear immediately appeared within the Evileye Tyrant King’s mind. He was a renowned ruthless character of his generation after all, and he didn’t think about any underlying reasons at a time like this at all as he used his full strength to raise his spiritual power to the strongest possible level as he attacked Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core. Everything could only develop in his favor once he dominated Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had kept his cool, but right at this moment, his body suddenly trembled. The Evileye Tyrant King suddenly felt a joyous sensation in this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This happiness was like that of a night of consummation, or the announcement of winning top marks in an examination. That happiness came from his inner heart, and happiness like that was inexplicably contagious. The existence of this sensation was what caused all the dark red colors within Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea to pause. The Evileye Tyrant King’s spiritual power was excited and waltzing around amid this happiness, like he had lost control over his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King’s expression changed drastically, but his heart was still filled with that intense happiness.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What… what’s happening?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King didn’t understand what was happening at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why am I suddenly developing this sensation?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The joyous atmosphere suddenly changed at this moment. Anger took over, and caused the dark red seawater to rile up turbulently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark red pillars of water surged into the sky one after another, like they had gone crazy, and they began blasting in all directions. Some of them rushed towards the Evileye Tyrant King’s spiritual origin, while some others surged towards Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King was now truly overcome with fear. He was panicking, yet he was brimming with fury.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why? Why is this happening? Hasn’t he completely abandoned his spiritual sea? Why does he seem to have control over his spiritual sea at a time like this? Why? Why is all of this happening?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nobody could answer his question, and the only thing he could feel at a time like this was that fury in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grief came after anger, and all the hysteria seemed to disappear in an instant. The dark red spiritual sea settled down, but it was filled with boundless grief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those long tentacles gradually slipped down from Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core because of that grief, and they quivered faintly as they limped weakly, like they were sobbing children.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything settled down within Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea in this moment, but specks of golden light appeared amid the dark red colors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bliss came after grief. Yes, that was endless joy. However, this blissfulness didn’t belong to the Evileye Tyrant King, but to Huo Yuhao instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was a kind of bliss that came from the bottom of his heart, the kind that was very contagious. Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core began to rotate with unprecedented speed amid all that bliss, and dense spiritual undulations immediately enabled his spiritual soul core to radiate with golden light that shone over his entire spiritual sea. The dark red colors were replaced with eye-catching reddish-gold hues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fear. There was only endless fear left in the Evileye Tyrant King’s heart. The unknown would always be the most frightening, and everything that he was experiencing was unknown to him, despite his seven hundred thousand years of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faint light flickered in the air continuously, and two silhouettes quietly glimmered into view beside Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core, and they were also radiating with blissful emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the Skydream Iceworm and the Mermaid Princess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They emanated gentle spiritual undulations, and their eyes were filled with disdain and contempt as they stared at the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A vigorous icy beam suddenly surged into Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea without warning right at this moment. Everything that this icy beam touched froze, and this icy beam froze almost the entire dark red sea. Even the Evileye Tyrant King’s spiritual origin had been frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A beautiful figure appeared quietly within Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea. White ribbons trapped the Evileye Tyrant King’s spiritual origin, and her face flowed with faint smiles as rising icy mists froze everything in place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress had been holding back for a long time, and she finally made her move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King didn’t even know that the Snow Empress wasn’t inside Huo Yuhao’s body. From his perspective, Huo Yuhao’s Spirits had been suppressed along with his spiritual sea. Only the Ice Empress had managed to escape outside, and she had already burned her power to save him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what about the Snow Empress? The Snow Empress had been waiting outside quietly from the beginning to the end, waiting for an opportunity to arise. Except, the Evileye Tyrant King couldn’t see her. The Snow Empress was outside the cavern, while Tang Wutong’s aura concealed her, and she didn’t reveal her aura at all. But at this moment, she was back!</span></p>
