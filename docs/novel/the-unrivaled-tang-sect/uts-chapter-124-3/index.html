That’s because she coincidentally shouted, “Be careful!”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong gazed at her deeply, and the light in his eyes became gentler. This caused Meng Hongchen to be stuck in a slight daze. She thought to herself subconsciously,</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s he thinking about?”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong turned to his left at this instant and managed to slide in between the two streaks of light.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Meng Hongchen’s attack wasn’t so easily avoided. The light blades struck each other behind Wang Dong and unleashed a layer of icy fog.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vermilion Ice Toad’s lethal poison had finally appeared in this critical last match of the tournament.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Below the stage, Elder Xuan, Wang Yan, He Caitou and Xiao Xiao were all extremely anxious. The key lay in whether Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong could resist this lethal poison!</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The icy fog covered a huge area. Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao were immediately engulfed, but Wang Dong didn’t seem to realize the lethal poison that was coming from his back. His wings revealed a golden light pattern before his second soul ring flashed brightly.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge number of golden balls of light suddenly appeared. They started to bombard Xiao Hongchen, who had also just unleashed his second wave of attacks.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Radiant Butterfly Goddess’ second soul skill, the Light of the Butterfly Goddess.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An intense aura of light filled the entire venue. This was everyone’s first time seeing the might of Wang Dong’s soul skill.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Huo Yuhao’s Imitation covering them, the soul rings that both Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong unleashed were white. No one could see exactly what class their soul skills were in. But the power of their soul skills wouldn’t change because of this!</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong quickly told Xiao Hongchen with his abilities that underestimating him was a big mistake.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An explosive boom reverberated within a 20 meter radius. Logically speaking, Wang Dong’s Light of the Butterfly Goddess shouldn’t have been able to resist the soul tool rays even if they could resist the soul tool cannons. But Xiao Hongchen’s attack was perfectly intercepted. The explosion only occurred between the two of them. A few of the balls formed by Wang Dong’s Light of the Butterfly Goddess landed even in front of Xiao Hongchen and forced him to resist using his Impregnable Wall.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only a soul ancestor’s strongest soul skill would have such an effect. Xiao Hongchen cursed in his heart. His cultivation was indeed not up to standard yet, such that the power of his soul tools couldn’t be fully unleashed. He was suppressed by Wang Dong’s second soul skill, and felt extremely depressed by that.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong had three rings. With the aid of Huo Yuhao’s twin martial soul that was close to a three-ringed cultivation, the combination of their soul powers reached above Rank 40.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s soul power might only be at Rank 28, but the sum of his soul power was not any less than Wang Dong. That was because his second martial soul might have a soul ring! Although most of the power of the hundred thousand year soul ring was sealed, his total soul power still managed to increase some.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Haodong Power didn’t function based on the laws of addition. Wang Dong’s Light of the Butterfly Goddess was also a thousand year soul skill. Under such a circumstance, their combined strike was already comparable to a top-ranked soul ancestor. They were as powerful as Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi with their unchanged martial souls, and that was without consideration for their martial fusion soul skills</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Hongchen was slightly shocked as she saw Wang Dong showing his might. She quickly adjusted her mentality and burst forward rapidly. Her thin swords turned into a sky full of light projections that slashed down towards Wang Dong. It was a pity that her armor was damaged, otherwise she would have flown into the air to fight Wang Dong.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Hongchen had a question in her mind right now. Why hadn’t the Vermilion Ice Toad’s poison taken effect yet?</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vermilion Ice Toad’s poison did engulf Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. But it was a pity that her poison was useless against them.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why was this? Only Huo Yuhao understood why. This could only be traced back to the time when Huo Yuhao caught hold of Bei Bei after he was defeated by the Ice Toad’s poison.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? How could this be? Such a soul beast still exists?”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ice Empress, what’s going on? What’s wrong with my eldest senior?”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s contracted a very hateful Ice Toad poison. The martial soul that hurt him is a Vermilion Ice Toad, a soul beast that roams the borders of the Extreme North. Its powers are quite extraordinary. Although it’s not really accomplished in the aspect of ice, it has managed to grasp the true meaning of the combination of ice and fire. That’s why the Ice Toad’s poison is extremely lethal, and very difficult to be neutralized.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Then what do we do? Ice Empress, can you neutralize this poison?”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t. That’s because your partner cannot bear the Ultimate Ice’s encroachment. He can only dispel the poison through the extreme chill in his own body. There’s no other way. If that method is used, only an ice-type body can handle the burden. Otherwise, one’s internal organs will be frozen.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Will I be poisoned?”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you joking? As one of the Three Heavenly Kings of the Extreme North, I am the king of all ice-type soul beasts. Although the Vermilion Ice Toad is a rather strong soul beast, there’s a reason why it doesn’t dare to enter the Extreme North region. That’s because the Ice Jade Scorpions are its jinx.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“While we gave up lethal poison to achieve the Ultimate Ice, we can’t be hurt by any ice-type poison. You don’t have to be afraid of her poison when you face her. No ice-type or fire-type poison can work against the Ultimate Ice.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Huo Yuhao had to appraise which soul skill of his was the most powerful, it had to be one of the four soul skills that the Ice Empress conferred onto him. In terms of both offense and defense, the Ice Empress lived up to its name as one of the Three Heavenly Kings of the Extreme North.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But if he had to choose the most practical soul skill, which one would he choose?</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If someone really understood his capabilities, he might think it was the Spiritual Detection. But Huo Yuhao would certainly choose the Spirit Eyes’ second soul skill, Imitation.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Imitation was a thousand year soul skill bestowed onto him by the clan members that the Skydream Iceworm helped him to find. Among all of Huo Yuhao’s soul skills, Imitation was the least offensively inclined. But it was the most important soul skill to him, even far more important than his Spiritual Detection.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Imitation was a thousand year soul skill, it depleted Huo Yuhao’s soul power the least when it was unleashed due to its special characteristic. Huo Yuhao could sustain it for a very long time, and he wouldn’t even be discovered by his opponent, unless his opponent’s spiritual power was beyond his, and they could use a special spiritual detection power to see through him.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only pity was that Imitation could only be used within a 3 meter radius with Huo Yuhao as the center. Otherwise, this soul skill would have been unbelievably powerful.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was using Imitation at this exact moment. Not only did his Imitation prevent his opponent from seeing him, but it also prevented his opponent from seeing what he was doing.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the spectators couldn’t see. When Imitation was used, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were actually masked by a layer of transparent armor that seemed to be made up of diamond-like particles. Their entire bodies were covered.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the Ice Empress’ Barrier, Huo Yuhao’s strongest defense-type soul skill. It was one of the two soul skills bestowed onto him by the four hundred thousand year Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s soul ring.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ultimate Ice’s defensive strength reached its peak under the Ice Empress’ Barrier. How could the Vermilion Ice Toad’s poison overcome it?</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dim radiance flashed. Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong seemed to be the same entity now. In fact, Huo Yuhao depleted more of his soul power than Wang Dong, who was attacking more actively.</span></p>

These soul skills were unleashed with all of Huo Yuhao’s might.</span></p>

His body was also able to bear more than what someone of his age should be able to. At least in terms of his physical strength, he was not weaker than Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen.</span></p>

It was time to snatch the final victory!</span></p>

The enhancements of her Class 6 swords were all in terms of offense. They were extremely destructive, and had even hurt Dai Yueheng earlier. The Vermilion Ice Toad poison that it contained was also the most lethal.</span></p>

When her swords were unleashed, they soared up immediately.</span></p>

At the same time, a ball of golden light shone on his chest. From the edge of the Radiant Butterfly Goddess’ wings, all the golden light started to gather towards Wang Dong’s chest as countless golden spots appeared.</span></p>
