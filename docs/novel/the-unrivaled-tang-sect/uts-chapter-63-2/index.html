 <p><strong>Book 10: Shrek's Seven Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 63.2: The Preparatory Team</strong></p>
 <p>He muttered, “An inborn Soul Commander! Is this the skill of a ten year soul ring? No, this is impossible, absolutely impossible.”</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan looked at Huo Yuhao agitatedly, then raised his left hand. When he did so, Huo Yuhao felt a burst of soul power enter his body, which caused the two white soul rings hovering beneath his body to become even more eye-catching.</p>
 <p>Whenever he used his Spirit Eyes, the color of Huo Yuhao’s soul rings was always white.</p>
 <p>As Elder Xuan’s soul power entered his body, his Imitation skill dissipated, which caused his second soul ring to reveal its original purple color. However, his first soul ring was still as white as jade.</p>
 <p>“Tell me, what are your two soul skills?” Elder Xuan asked impatiently.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao told him the truth. “The first soul ring of my Spirit Eyes has the Spiritual Detection Sharing skill while the second one has the Imitation skill.”</p>
 <p>“Elder Xuan continued in a grave tone, “If I’m not mistaken, you used the Spiritual Shock skill during the freshmen assessment. How did you obtain that skill?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was startled. After all, he couldn’t tell Elder Xuan his secret. Luckily, he had already thought of a way to explain it.</p>
 <p>“Elder Xuan, I’m a disciple of the Tang Sect. Therefore, I practice the Tang Sect’s Purple Demon Eyes technique. And when I combine it with my Spirit Eyes, I can use the Spiritual Shock skill.”</p>
 <p>After listening to his words, Elder Xuan’s expression was even more bewildered, “Is this even possible? The skill of a mere ten year soul ring was able to reach this degree? Just... how? So soul skills can have mutations too?” Even after racking his brain, he was still at a loss. He was firmly convinced that Huo Yuhao couldn’t hide the color of his soul rings under the probing of his soul power. And even if he were to bang his head against a wall, he still wouldn't think of the possibility that Huo Yuhao possessed a million year soul ring. After all, how could he know that its white color was also the same as that of a ten year soul ring?</p>
 <p>After pondering over it for a while, he still wasn’t able to find the answer. Thus, he said, “Fine. You can go too. Originally, even if they were to win, second year students like you wouldn’t be allowed to join the competition as reserves. However, your performance was just too incredible. Remember, whether or not you can keep this position in the coming five years will depend on your efforts. There are many core disciples eyeing this position. Which means that the moment I see that you can’t keep up with the competition, you’ll be switched out immediately. Are we clear?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong bowed respectfully to Elder Xuan following which they turned around and left.</p>
 <p>As he gazed at their disappearing silhouettes, a faint smile appeared on his face, which was full of vicissitudes. “So what if they’re only second year students? Two twin martial souls, an Ultimate martial soul, and a fusion skill. Five years, huh? Who dares to claim that I can’t forge them into a team that will be unmatched among their peers? I hope you’ll bring me even more surprises.”</p>
 <p>After leaving the Soul Dueling Area, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong discovered that Bei Bei, He Caitou, Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan, and Xiao Xiao were all still waiting for them outside.</p>
 <p>“Senior brothers! You haven’t left yet?” Huo Yuhao dragged Wang Dong along as hurried to greet them.</p>
 <p>“We were waiting for you two. We wanted to thank you!” Bei Bei said with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>“Thank us?” Huo Yuhao asked, astonished.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei nodded and replied, “In that chaotic battle just now, strength alone wasn’t enough to obtain victory. After all, we had four rings. Sooner or later, we would have received a joint attack from the other students. It’s all thanks to the two of you that we were able to win so easily. Your Spiritual Detection and fusion skill with Wang Dong proved to be a crucial role in our victory.”</p>
 <p>“Senior brother, aren’t we a family?” Huo Yuhao said shyly. “Without you, we wouldn’t have been able to pass the test either.”</p>
 <p>“That’s enough.” Xu Sanshi interjected, “You two brothers should stop flattering each other. Little Yuhao, we stayed behind for another reason too. Since we have been selected as Shrek’s Seven Monsters’ substitutes, we should give our all. None of us is allowed to fall behind. Only then will we be able to represent the academy at the Continental Advanced Academy Soul Dueling Tournament five years from now.”</p>
 <p>While speaking, he secretly shot a glance at the nearby Jiang Nannan. Right now, she was hanging her head and looking at her feet. Xu Sanshi was very happy to have passed the test with Jiang Nannan. Now, he had found the best excuse to be with her.</p>
 <p>“Little Yuhao, Wang Dong, we discussed another thing while you were away. Since we’re going to be the new generation of Shrek’s Seven Monsters, we should decide on an order, like the first generation did. How old are you?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong told them their ages in years and months.</p>
 <p>They then ranked themselves according to age.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei was the oldest. He Caitou, Xu Sanshi, and Jiang Nannan and him all had a month’s difference between each other, just like Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong, and Xiao Xiao.</p>
 <p>After Bei Bei, there was He Caitou. After that was Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan, Xiao Xiao, Huo Yuhao, and finally Wang Dong, who was the youngest.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi spoke with a smile. “Previously, we used to refer to each other as upperclassmen. But in the future, we can just refer to each other as brothers and sisters. Wahahaha! I’m ranked third, just like Ancestor Tang San was back then.”</p>
 <p>“Having the same rank doesn’t mean having the same ability,” Bei Bei said ill-humoredly, “It’s not a problem to call each other brothers. However, if you become part of our Tang Sect, you’ll have to follow in his footsteps.”</p>
 <p>“Didn’t I already tell you my conditions for joining your sect?” Xu Sanshi said with a smile. As he spoke, he looked at Jiang Nannan and puckered his lips.</p>
 <p>At this time, unexpectedly, He Caitou laughed foolishly and said, “Bei Bei… Uh, I mean senior brother. Can I also join your Tang Sect?”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei was dumbfounded when he heard that but quickly regained his composure. Naturally, he was overjoyed after all He Caitou was already a Class 4 soul engineer as well as Fan Yu’s inheriting disciple. In the Soul Tool Department, his status was higher compared to that of Bei Bei’s and Xu Sanshi’s in the Martial Soul Department. He was someone that would surely enter the inner courtyard of the Soul Tool Department.</p>
 <p>“Caitou, can I ask why you want to join our Tang Sect?” Although he was very happy, Bei Bei still wanted to make things clear.</p>
 <p>“Yuhao used many concepts related to the hidden weapons of the Tang Sect when creating his soul tools.” He Caitou said with a smile, “I was also thinking of studying them. Even if I’m a soul engineer, I’m not restricted from entering any sect. Moreover, what you said earlier was right! If I joined the Tang Sect, calling you senior brother would be more fitting.”</p>
 <p>Under these circumstances, how could Bei Bei refuse? He immediately agreed. Except for Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan, the rest of the substitutes for Shrek’s Seven Monsters substitutes were now all disciples of the Tang Sect.</p>
