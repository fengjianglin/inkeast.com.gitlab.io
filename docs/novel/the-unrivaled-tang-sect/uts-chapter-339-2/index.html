I know my limits. Also, I’m very eager to see how much we’ll gain from tonight’s show, and who’ll be the main lead.” As he finished speaking, he revealed a wide grin on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he looked at the Skydream Iceworm, he sent him a message telepathically. As his back was facing the Ice Empress, she didn’t discover anything.</span></p>

He had grown up. He was no longer inferior to these hundred-thousand year and million-year soul beasts at the spiritual level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm revealed a slightly weird look as he nodded at Huo Yuhao. After that, he grinned, revealing the smile of an Iceworm…</span></p>

At this point, they were in a western suburb five miles outside Radiant City.</span></p>

When he opened his eyes, he seemed slightly lost. However, no one noticed that a distorted light pattern had surfaced between his eyebrows, as it disappeared right after it surfaced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ve arrived!” a voice declared from outside.</span></p>

He Caitou moved Huo Yuhao’s wheelchair down first before setting him down in it.</span></p>

However, he returned to normal as the night breeze blew past him.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao was slightly stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tonight’s event is really large-scale!</span></p>

They were clearly separated into three regions in three different directions. The greatest difference between the three regions was the dress code of the people inside them, as they were all decked out in different colors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Duskwater Alliance’s camp was in front. To the front left were people in white warrior robes. To the front right, the people were clad in yellow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen An jumped off the carriage at this point and quickly introduced them. “Tonight, all the senior members of the three underground organizations are here. All three parties regard this tournament highly, and they have all sent their strongest lineups to grace tonight’s event.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those in white hail from the Alto Chamber of Commerce, while those in yellow are from the Common Alliance. Apart from these three parties, some notable families in Radiant City were also invited, as well as some rich clients who have wagered heavily on tonight’s tournament. The only restriction that the three parties have is that there shouldn’t be more than one thousand guests from each side. The rest here are the spectators. Anyway, everything will be carried out fairly, so please do not worry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s lips moved slightly. For some reason, he felt that today’s tournament was going to be fairer than the Continental Elite Youth Soul Master Tournament. At least the referee wasn’t inclined towards any side. Perhaps profits were sometimes better than things that appeared to be very honorable, but were actually secretly deplorable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them were led into the tournament venue by Chen An, under the protection of a bunch of men clad in black from the Duskwater Alliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The western suburb area wasn’t considered too shabby. The perimeter was surrounded by people from the three underground organizations, covering the entire venue. There were even people sent to seal the roads to prevent ordinary citizens from getting too close.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spectator stands had already been set up within this perimeter. There were three different spectator stands, each filled with bettors that had their money on tonight’s tournament. There were other, even smaller circular spectator stands, which were closer to the core region. They were occupied by the members of the notable families who were here today, as well as reputable soul masters and soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tournament ground was the most shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The circular stage in this tournament ground was just like a replica of the stage in the Continental Elite Youth Soul Master Tournament. It was also one hundred meters in diameter, and there seemed to be protective barriers around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most hilarious thing was that there were also three resting areas around the stage, located in three different directions. If they were connected by straight lines, they would form a triangle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was brought to the resting area of the Duskwater Alliance. Nangong Wan and the Third Elder also came in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao thought to himself,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Don’t tell me there’s only the two of them from the Duskwater Alliance? From how highly the Duskwater Alliance regards this tournament, there should be more senior members present...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the place had become quite rowdy. Before the tournament began, there wasn’t a host to liven up the atmosphere. Those who were seated in the spectator seats and the VIP seats were all conversing with one another. The lighting in the venue was very good, soul lamps illuminating the entire place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he saw all this, Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soul tools should be used in the lives of ordinary people. No one does it better than the Sun Moon Empire. In this aspect, the other three empires on the continent are indeed lacking! This is a gap that cannot be closed by the strength of one individual, and it’ll take time, too. Even if they’ve realized this now, they can only choose to play catch-up in terms of their military strength...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Elder whispered to Nangong Wan, “I heard they’ve hired Class 9 soul engineers to hold the fort this time. On the seven-man committee, three belong to them, while we only have two from our side. The other two are neutrals. Will there be a problem?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nangong Wan laughed coldly and said, “No. The vice-founder will bring elder brother, third brother, fifth brother, and sixth brother over later. Do you think we’ll be scared of them? If not for the fact that we’re giving face to the imperial family of the Sun Moon Empire, do you think the lowly Alto Chamber of Commerce and Common Alliance could challenge us? The profit distribution in this tournament is very important. The founder instructed us to strictly follow protocol. However, we should be able to gain flexibility in some areas with the vice-founder around. I’d really like to see if the people they’ve pulled over will dare to oppose us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Elder also revealed a cold smile on his face, and nodded his acknowledgement gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Huo Yuhao looked very calm, he was observing everything around him seriously. After he heard from Nangong Wan that there would be more senior members from the Holy Ghost Church coming later, he was secretly surprised by the strength and foundation of the Holy Ghost Church. However, he was also delighted, as there was bound to be a dispersion of the Holy Ghost Church’s strength. When things happened, they were going to be in huge trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, everyone from all three parties had already arrived. Someone came over to ask Nangong Wan something. After receiving his verification, all the lights were focused on the stage where an additional person had now appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person was tall, broad, and extremely handsome. He wore a bright-red, elegant formal suit. His golden hair was neatly combed, and his eyes seemed to sparkle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

My name is Lu Qi.” The voice of this emcee was rather pleasant, &nbsp;loud and husky. Along with his charming looks, he seemed quite likable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao had already scanned him using his Spiritual Detection. Lu Qi was only an ordinary person. He had no soul power undulations.</span></p>

It was very normal to have such a host. However, this host’s performance was rather normal! The self-entitled thinking of evil soul masters couldn’t be understood through a normal person’s eyes.</span></p>

He was wearing a purple overcoat, and appeared very decent, with the aura of a powerful person. Just from his looks, it was very difficult to imagine him controlling an organization that was involved in piracy and murder. He seemed more like an official. He took long strides, and his eyes were very sharp.</span></p>

From afar, she appeared very beautiful. Her long maroon hair was rolled up into a bun above her head. As she walked, her body swayed in an elegant manner. She had a very holy look on her face, and seemed like a mortal masterpiece. Her slender waist and devilish figure made her extremely captivating.</span></p>
