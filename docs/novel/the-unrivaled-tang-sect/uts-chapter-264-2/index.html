As his palms entered the spring, there was a sudden explosion in the Blazing Sunspring. The terrifying aura that raged forth after that even swept all the way over to Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Steam started to rise from Huo Yuhao’s body. This was the result as Ultimate Ice clashed with Ultimate Fire. Right now, he seemed to be intoxicated, and didn’t appear to feel anything. He cupped some of the spring water in his hands and brought it to his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mist started to rise from his palms. Even though he had Ultimate Ice to protect his body, he had no intention of protecting himself. Blisters started to surface on his hands. They were like cooked shrimp at this point, burning red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dong’er! My love for you is pure. I will succeed!” He knelt down beside the sunspring and lifted his head and hands as the plants all looked at him. Before Wang Qiu’er could grab hold of him, he swallowed the spring water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A red gust rose from his head, and a layer of thick icy fog was unleashed from his body. Wang Qiu’er’s hand was pushed away by this layer of fog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t stop. His face had already turned completely red, and he looked like a drunk. However, he still managed to focus and activate the Instant Teleportation from his left leg soul bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A golden light flashed, and he teleported all the way back to the black stone, arriving in front of the Yearning Heartbroken Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes had already turned red at this point. However, there was a satisfied smile on his face. However, this look of satisfaction appeared a little weird on his red face. However, it also seemed a little sacred!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, you will die!” Wang Qiu’er cried. She also activated her Instant Teleportation, but she wasn’t teleported as far as Huo Yuhao. She was too late. She watched as Huo Yuhao slapped his chest for the second time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She saw him spewing blood from his mouth. His blood landed on the Yearning Heartbroken Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this instant, time seemed to have stood still. Wang Qiu’er collapsed onto the ground, and tears flowed down her face. At this moment, she couldn’t imagine what he had been through. At the same time, she also felt that her heart had broken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huo Yuhao, Huo Yuhao!” Wang Qiu’er was crying sorrowfully. She was crying sorrowfully with her eyes shut.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao’s eyes were wide open. He was staring at the white flower and his own blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ice melted. As his blood fused together, it started to seep into the flower. A layer of pure and holy light shone from the flower and engulfed Huo Yuhao. It was shaking slightly, as if it were struggling. The blood of sorrow on the petal started to fade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though it looked very delicate, all the flowers surrounding the Icefire Yin Yang Well closed and drooped when it broke free from the black stone. This included the Delicate Silk Immortal, the Blazed Delicate Apricot, the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass and the Wonderloft Chrysanthemum . They were like subjects bowing down to their king.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The small, white flower drifted quietly in front of Huo Yuhao and stuck closely to his cheek. It was as if it had found its lover, and was exuding a jade glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s expression turned a little silly. Even though his hands were filled with blisters and looked as if they were melting, and even though blood was coming out of the pores of his body before turning into ice flakes, he still smiled in deep satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He opened his mouth and wanted to say something. However, his throat had been scalded by the Blazing Sunspring water. His voice was very hoarse, but it was possible to tell what he was trying to say by reading his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dong’er, I have succeeded!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white flower stuck closely to his face and didn’t fall off. The glow that came from it was still flashing, as if it were soothing his hurt body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s body shook slightly, and he almost fell down. He forcefully twisted his head to look at Wang Qiu’er. There was a pleading look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er had just crawled up from the ground. At this moment, she didn’t dare to reject him no matter how aloof and sad she was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I promise!” Wang Qiu’er muttered as she cried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s lips moved. Fresh blood flowed from his body. His body was slowly collapsing to the ground. Before he completely collapsed, he forced his head to one side so that the Yearning Heartbroken Grass wouldn’t touch the ground. He was afraid of crushing the delicate flower. No, he was afraid of crushing Wang Dong’er’s hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er walked towards Huo Yuhao slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body crashed irregularly to the ground. Fresh blood continued to stream from his mouth and nose. His life was slowly diminishing. The flesh on his hands had mostly melted off, and his bones could almost be seen. An intense chill was surging through his body. It was about to blow him apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s, he’s about to die. He’s really about to die?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s heart was trembling. She turned around suddenly to look at the Delicate Silk Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What can save him, what can save him?” She was almost shouting hysterically. As she spoke, she lifted Huo Yuhao up and rushed in front of the Delicate Silk Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal’s voice was also filled with sorrow, “He’s hurt too badly. The spring water that he swallowed has already burned his throat, windpipe and even his heart. He didn’t activate the Ultimate Ice in his body to resist the scorching spring water. Because of this, the blood that he spat out was burning. It’s really blood from his heart! He is the best human I’ve ever seen. His stubbornness towards love isn’t inferior to that of Tang San and Xiao Wu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop spouting nonsense now. Can you save him? If he dies, I’ll bury all of you here with him.” Wang Qiu’er’s face was stained with tears. However, an indescribable force was unleashed from her body at this instant. Her powdery-blue hair quickly turned golden and flew up behind her back. Her sky blue eyes also turned golden. She released an indescribable aura from her body. Golden light rapidly spread from her body, and everything that surrounded her was dyed gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The plants started to tremble in deep fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop, please stop first!” The Delicate Silk Immortal was shuddering as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er said coldly, “He dies, I die, everyone dies.” The golden light stopped spreading momentarily. Every word from her mouth was very determined. She was so determined that it was terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal was a little stunned as she said, “His, his lover doesn’t seem to be you...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er said coldly, “Is this related to what I asked? It’s not important whether he loves me. However, I have realized that I love him. Since he can give up his life for her, I can also do the same thing. Do you really have no way of saving him? If you don’t, I have a plan. However, all of you will die if I use this plan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal sighed and said, “Initially, there was no way. However, there might be a chance since you love him so much. Unless you can…”</span></p>
