 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course it looks better longer.” Huo Yuohao blurted almost instantaneously. When Wang Dong asked that question, Huo Yuhao recalled the time when they had unleashed the Raiment of Light together. The flowing long hair that resembled tidal waves gave Huo Yuhao an overly strong impression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh.” Wang Dong stared at Huo Yuhao’s lackadaisical eyes and asked, “What are you thinking about?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head. He sighed and said, “I was thinking about the fourth martial soul fusion skill that we used during the last Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament, our Solitary Dance Amidst the Frost, Raiment of Light. Do you still remember? Do you remember the shadows that we projected? How nice would it have been if you were a girl! You would have been stunning. I feel like you were the blueprint for the figures that we conjured, except I have no clue why you became a female.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’s face blushed faintly, and he said with a bashful voice, “So what if I was a girl? What does that have to do with you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was still reminiscing on the enchanting scene that was still vivid in his memory. He didn’t pay attention to the change in Wang Dong’s voice as he chuckled, “Of course it has something to do with me! The pavilion closest to the water enjoys the first moonlight. It’s better that I benefit from this, and not outsiders.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong laughed and said, “If you really think that way, I’ll introduce my sister to you after we finish this exchange program. She looks just like me, and she looks very similar to my projection during our Raiment of Light!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes sparkled. “Really? That’s great! You’re such a good bro.” He hugged Wang Dong across the shoulder as he spoke, and passionate warmth flowed uncontrollably from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong snapped, “I didn’t think you were so big on physical appearance as well. Is it that important for someone to be good-looking?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao rolled his eyes and snapped back, “Those that ask that question are either extremely good-looking or terribly ugly. Those who lack good looks also lack self-confidence, and maybe they lack the bravery to try. And those like you are just arrogant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Physical appearance is the first thing people notice when they first meet each other. How many people can get to know each other? That level of interaction requires time. Physical appearance is a way of choosing who to interact with – of course, looks aren’t absolute, but every person knows what he or she wants. This is probably why ‘love at first sight’ exists.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong glanced at him and said, “Your theory is very persuasive. It seems like you’ve been getting your fill of girls inside the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy – with abilities like yours, I’m sure many girls have a crush on you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s talk inside.” Huo Yuhao placed his index finger on his mouth. They were back at the dormitory, and Huo Yuhao opened the door before he dragged Wang Dong inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You really do!” Wang Dong said, amused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao closed the door, pulled over a chair and pressed Wang Dong down into it. “Sit down. I know you are a clean freak, and I stay here alone, so it’s a little messy – I’m going to clean up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need for that. Am I really that particular?” Wang Dong chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao gave a serious nod in his direction, but he couldn’t help but laugh out loud as he said, “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong was furious. “Then go ahead and clean up by yourself. Can’t believe I was going to help you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “That’s alright. I can do it myself.” He went to work as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was the only one living here, just like he had said. He was also an exchange student, so teachers didn’t come to inspect the cleanliness of his dorm room. There wasn’t much clothing and whatnot in the room, but it was strewn with all sorts of materials for forging soul tools, to the point where there wasn’t much space to walk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was concerned about Wang Dong’s religious preference for cleanliness, so he hurriedly packed up his room. Thankfully, storage-type soul tools existed in this world, so cleaning up wasn’t that difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong said, “I can tell from the situation of your dorm room that you have been rather hardworking over these past two years. Your spiritual power is also much more powerful, and even your soul power contains tinges of spiritual power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed. “Isn’t it the same for you? I can feel that you’ve reached the threshold.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes,” Wang Dong nodded his head faintly, “Let’s not talk about all that. You haven’t answered my question when we were still outside. We haven’t met for two years – do you really have something going on with the girls here? And do you still want me to introduce you to my sister?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and answered, “Something did happen, but it’s not what you think.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He continued talking as he cleaned up his room. “I was assigned to a laboratory when I first arrived, and several students were also part of it. I had a senior, and her name was Ju Zi.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he brought up her name, the deepest recesses of Huo Yuhao’s spirit quivered involuntarily. Even though he was well-aware that the two of them were like two parallel lines, he couldn’t deny that the young girl that that planted her first kiss on his cheek left quite an impression in his memory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ju Zi?” Wang Dong softly repeated her name as he watched the subtle changes in Huo Yuhao’s eyes. The two of them had been apart for more than two years, but he knew Huo Yuhao too well. He could tell from Huo Yuhao’s voice that this girl had left a deep mark in his heart. Wang Dong himself wasn’t like the proud youth that he was two years ago, and had become much more mature. He didn’t interrupt, but quietly listened to Huo Yuhao because he could feel that even though two years had passed, time hadn’t placed a wedge in his relationship with Huo Yuhao. Otherwise, why would Huo Yuhao confide in him just like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, her name was Ju Zi. She was very pretty, and her complexion was stunning. That was the first impression that she gave me. However, she was just so mysterious, and even now, I don’t even know where she’s gone, or what secrets she had.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She said that she was leaving, and she wanted to give me a present for our transient acquaintance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s emotional voice paused momentarily. Wang Dong was listening intently, and the bottom of his eyes started becoming moist. “This girl was so pitiable. No wonder you have such chemistry with her – there are many similarities in your backgrounds and experiences. What present did she leave for you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao whispered, “She kissed my cheek. She said that was the first kiss that she had given, but she said she couldn’t kiss my lips without my permission. She said she hoped that I would leave my first kiss for the girl of my dreams.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong trembled, and a strange light pulsed from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She was so nice to you! Always thinking about you. Since you were clearheaded back then, why didn’t you consider getting together with her? I think age isn’t a problem for us soul masters at all. She’s so kind, and so pitiful – did you not feel anything for her, not even a little bit?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao lowered his head and stared at the ground. His brief acquaintance with Ju Zi was long gone, but he could vividly remember every detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I thought I would be moved as well. In fact, I did feel something for her – but I realized that all I felt for Ju Zi was compassion and sympathy, and a little bit of pity. I want to thank her, because she helped me understand what a romantic relationship means. Wang Dong…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh?” Wang Dong responded, confused. “What’s wrong?”</span></p>

Ju Zi moved me, so I finally understood what I felt inside. It may sound a little ridiculous, but I’m afraid I fell in love, at first sight, with the projection that we created.”</span></p>

However, just when I wanted to ask her to stay, the projection from the Raiment of Light surfaced in my mind. I knew then that the projection had been occupying my heart this whole time, even though she was only a virtual entity. However, she dominated the space in my heart that was reserved for love, and I can no longer accommodate anything else. It was Ju Zi who helped me reconcile the feelings in my heart. Even if our lives hadn’t been two parallel lines, I don’t think I would have been able to accept her.”</span></p>

Now that I think about it, it does sound a little incredulous. Sometimes, rationality and the human heart cannot be controlled. So, if you have a sister that looks just like our projection, I may indeed feel something for her! Of course, that’s assuming she can accept me, and I can like her as well. How about you? Have you been getting any action at Shrek? I remember that Xiao Hongchen’s sister, oh, Meng Hongchen, crushed on you at some point!”</span></p>
