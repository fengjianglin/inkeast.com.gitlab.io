The most terrifying thing about a Sunmoon Divine Needle was that it could compress a huge amount of energy into a wisp. The destructive power of a single streak of light unleashed by a Sunmoon Divine Needle was extremely terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao had resisted one strike today, and all his defensive soul tools were crushed. He was even badly scorched.</span></p>

Naturally, these two Class 9 soul engineers heard him. However, hearing him and seeing what was going on were two different things. From the looks of it, those two beams of light were about to shoot towards them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two Class 9 soul engineers couldn’t be bothered with their image anymore. Both of them screamed, and different-colored protective barriers flashed wildly. It was more important for them to save their own lives, no matter the cost of the defensive soul tools they had to use!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two tremendous booms resonated across the sky. Two golden-silver suns seemed to have lit up the sky.</span></p>

At the same time, they flew diagonally downward. However, they weren’t flying towards the twelve black doors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Huo Yuhao’s Imitation could conceal them, they would still be revealed if they were struck by an area of effect attack. Huo Yuhao couldn’t possibly take any risks right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two soul engineer legions had already chased after them, and all the soul engineers could naturally tell what was happening. They also possessed a wealth of experience and instantly unleashed area of effect attacks using their soul tools. The area that they covered included the route that Huo Yuhao and Dai Hao had to take to reach the twelve black doors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Huo Yuhao’s earlier choice had been wrong, they wouldn’t have been able to escape in the face of this barrage of attacks.</span></p>

The carpet attacks that they unleashed would certainly not target the region they were in.</span></p>

Before they entered the Star Luo Empire this time, they had made rich preparations, and thus managed to preserve their lives even when facing attacks from the two Sunmoon Divine Needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What left Ye Yulin pale was that Huo Yuhao didn’t just tap into the power of his Sunmoon Divine Needles, but also disappeared with them as he and Dai Hao vanished. Those were Class 9 soul tools! Their value couldn’t be measured in terms of money! Furthermore, they were Sunmoon Divine Needles that possessed immense destructive strength. He only had one Sunmoon Divine Needle left with him now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The twelve black doors quickly shut after the last White Tiger bodyguard entered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the soul engineers were furious and charged towards those twelve black doors after they failed to locate Huo Yuhao and Dai Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was a pity that these doors that came from Huo Yuhao’s spectral demiplane weren’t real entities. Soul rays and cannon shells were unable to enter through or damage the doors. Only living creatures and specters were able to cross through them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time the soul engineers reached the doors, they had already shut and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

It was already too late for the two soul engineer legions to use their thermal detectors and aerial surveillance soul tools. Thermal detectors could only operate within a limited range. It was impossible for them to locate Huo Yuhao and Dai Hao anymore!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was panting heavily now. While he had only fought for a short time earlier, he had put everything he had into that fight. Not only were his soul and spiritual power greatly drained, but his energy was also expended. Both he and Dai Hao had faced many powerful soul engineers earlier. If they had made even one mistake, they would have died!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao put the Sunmoon Divine Needle away in his storage-type soul tool and said sincerely, “Thanks. You’ve saved me once again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had already resigned himself to the fact that he was going to die today, but hadn’t expected this miraculous person to appear and save not just his subordinates, but himself as well! He knew how dangerous things had been earlier. Right now, his back was still covered in cold sweat. However, this person in front of him didn’t care about anything else and saved him. In addition, this person also demonstrated all sorts of strange abilities. It seemed like he would appear every time he was in danger. Who exactly was he?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao glanced at Dai Hao, and a complicated look flashed across his eyes. He only shook his head and didn’t say anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them flew close to fifty kilometers before Huo Yuhao led Dai Hao to a remote area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“White Tiger Duke, I’ll only be with you until here. Your White Tiger bodyguards have been sent into another dimension. I’ll lead them out now. Quickly, take them and leave.” As he spoke, Huo Yuhao recited a few incantations and a black door opened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was only one door this time. Opening twelve doors at once was extremely draining on his soul power. If not for the fact that he wanted the White Tiger bodyguards to escape as quickly as possible earlier, he wouldn’t have opened so many doors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had thought out his plan to save the White Tiger Duke in a very short period of time. First, he unleashed his Spectral Doors at a distant location before making them invisible in the air. At the same time, he dispelled all the undead at the entrances of his Spectral Doors as he entered his spectral demiplane. They wouldn’t get close to the entrances for a while. In this way, the White Tiger bodyguards wouldn’t easily uncover the secret of his demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next, he returned to the battlefield and told the White Tiger bodyguards that they could make their move. After that, he rose into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he came up with this plan, Huo Yuhao had devised it according to the orders that the White Tiger Duke gave. Otherwise, there wouldn’t have been so many coincidences!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following this, he had unleashed all the abilities of his Spirit Eyes to their fullest. When he devised his plan, Huo Yuhao had clearly delegated himself a role. His role was to pester, and not to attack or fight. Given his individual strength, it was impossible for him to resist so many soul engineers. Fighting was a surefire way to die. He only had a chance by using his spiritual-type soul skills to pester his opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, they were very effective on the battlefield. He eventually completed his rescue mission, an almost impossible task. He had performed a miracle. Whether it was the White Tiger Duke or the Starsky Douluo, they still weren’t able to figure out his true identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke started tearing up when he saw his White Tiger bodyguards streaming out from the black door. If not for this person in front of him, all of his brothers would have died on the battlefield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Benefactor, can you let us see your true appearance? You’ve saved us twice. I have to repay these two favors. In the future, I’ll help you fulfill any requests you have unless they betray my own principles and beliefs.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao would never say something like this if Huo Yuhao had only saved him. However, Huo Yuhao had saved the lives of both him and his bodyguards on two different occasions. Given what he had done, Dai Hao couldn’t help but make this heavy promise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was slightly stunned, and replied, “Alright, remember what you’ve said today. As for my appearance, I won’t reveal it. You’ll get to see it one day.”</span></p>
