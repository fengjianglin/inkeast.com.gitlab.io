 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao held Tang Wutong’s hand as they flew through the air, while Radiant City was in a complete mess not far behind them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Radiant City was in disarray. Not just because of Xu Tianran’s death, but also because many aerial surveillance soul tools were exploding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only a small number of people knew about Xu Tianran’s death for the moment, but the entire city’s citizens could see the exploding aerial surveillance soul tools in the sky. That was something that couldn’t be hidden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Radiant City had descended into chaos, and nobody knew how long it would take before it could settle down. However, Huo Yuhao was very confident in Ju Zi. She was too capable, and almost every situation was within her grasp. Since she had prepared to deal with Xu Tianran, she had definitely also prepared for what would come afterward. Now was the time for her to flip her cards one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong left just like that. He didn’t even try to arrange anything, and neither did he obtain a definite answer from Ju Zi. He knew that they were leaving a little too abruptly. He also wanted to stay, and he wanted to watch Ju Zi reorganize the Sun Moon Empire’s internal affairs, and execute her promise of not moving against the Star Luo Empire and the Dou Ling Empire within ten years. That was her best choice. As long as he and Tang Wutong were around to intimidate the Sun Moon Empire, he believed that she wouldn’t dare to do anything rash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he had to leave. If he didn’t leave, both he and Tang Wutong would probably not be able to leave ever again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had rained hell upon Xu Tianran to destroy him during that epic battle, but serious problems surfaced in their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cracks were conspicuously tearing out over the barriers that Long Xiaoyao and Ye Xishui had left in their bodies, and these barriers could crumble at any moment. Once these barriers crumbled, they would both run the risk of going insane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially so for Huo Yuhao, because the Evileye Tyrant King’s spiritual power was still revolting violently within his spiritual sea. The Skydream Iceworm really couldn’t hold on any longer, and he didn’t even have time to take this news back to Shrek Academy at a time like this. They had to find a place to cultivate. Otherwise, they would be faced with certain death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, he said a few brief sentences before he quickly took Tang Wutong away from Radiant City and toward the Heavenly Soul Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How are you, Yuhao?” Tang Wutong could clearly feel that Huo Yuhao’s palm was ice-cold, and his soul power was surging about vigorously within his body. His body radiated with strange light, and that was a sign of Huo Yuhao almost losing control over his soul power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t look so good as he said, “I’m afraid I can’t hold on for much longer. We have to find a place to cultivate. If not, we’ll be in trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong nodded and said, “Let’s do it here. We can’t delay this any longer.” There was a valley beneath them. They couldn’t be bothered with getting the direction right because of the big problems that had risen in their bodies, and they didn’t know where they were. But they couldn’t be bothered with anything else as they immediately went down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong punched a hole in the side of the mountain, and she supported Huo Yuhao as they snuck inside. They didn’t even have time to conceal themselves at a time like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The two of you can rest assured as you cultivate. We’ll protect you guys.” The Snow Empress and the Ice Empress emerged from Huo Yuhao’s body at the same time. They had nervous expressions on their faces, because the soul power and spiritual power within Huo Yuhao’s body were just too vast. Even with their experience and their knowledge, they had never seen such vast energy undulations, which seemed to go beyond this world’s limits, and Huo Yuhao could explode at any moment. If that happened, then all the effort that they had put in before this would be wasted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t even express his gratitude. He was barely able to fly, and he was already controlling himself as much as he could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He sat down on the ground and immediately focused as he used all his spiritual power to control his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong helped him cross his legs and sat opposite him. They could no longer use Haodong power to cultivate. Furthermore, the soul power within their bodies was too vast, so she couldn’t help Huo Yuhao at all. She was facing a similarly huge problem, and she only observed Huo Yuhao for a moment and made sure that he wasn’t in any danger before she started to meditate. The first thing she had to do was maintain that barrier in her body before anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s barrier was starting to break apart irrevocably, as soul power that resembled tidal waves surged around in this body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core had been filled by the Evileye Tyrant King’s formidable spiritual power, and Long Xiaoyao’s soul power had also filled his Ultimate Ice soul core to the brim. Huo Yuhao’s body was like an enormous balloon that had been pumped with as much air as it could take, and it was still being pumped continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body was already starting to swell. His veins bulged on his skin, and his body was an unhealthy red color. A golden sun and a blue moon flickered incessantly behind him, and the air would contort faintly with every flicker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, Tang Wutong was sitting opposite him. A golden sun and a purple moon flickered behind her at the same time, and they resonated with Huo Yuhao’s aura. This resonance, and perhaps also because of their Yin Yang Complement soul cores, barely suppressed that energy storm in Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress and the Snow Empress stood guard at the cave entrance. The Ice Empress glanced at the Snow Empress worriedly and asked, “He’s not in a very good state. Can he hold on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress lowered her voice and said, “He definitely can. Haven’t we succeeded in tiding through every single trouble and toil over these years, no matter what we’ve faced? This is the last step he has to take, and if he can succeed, then he will rise through the heavens. Our dream will come true. But if he fails…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled brightly as she spoke. “So what if he fails? If not for him, we’d probably have been dead a long time ago. Let’s just accompany him if he fails.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress was astonished. “Have you made up your mind, Snow Empress?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled faintly and replied, “Are you really asking me that? Haven’t you made up your mind too? You’re just unwilling to admit it. Even though you’re always so fierce toward the Skydream Iceworm every day, I can tell that your eyes have become increasingly tender and gentle. Seems like you’ve truly found someone that you like. You have already decided to fuse your origin with Yuhao, haven’t you? And you’re going to do that because Skydream has already completed his own fusion in order to help him. So we are left with our spiritual origin, and that’s the last strength we can use to help him. We cannot be separated from him after completing this fusion, and even if he does succeed in reaching that world in the end, we cannot separate ourselves from him. That’s the true meaning of one for all, and all for one. I can’t bear to leave you guys! So why can’t I have made up my mind?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress held the Snow Empress’ hand. She blushed as he said, “Snow, I… I didn’t with that fellow…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress giggled and said, “We’ve known each other for hundreds of thousands of years. How can I not know what you’re thinking about? Don’t overthink this, because I’m not trying to tease you. I am truly happy for the two of you! Aren’t we all in a good place right now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. No matter what, we have to help him pass this difficult test. Let me go first, Snow. Yuhao is in a terrible situation now, and he needs to stabilize himself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, go. I’ll stay here.” The Snow Empress looked at the Ice Empress seriously, and she hugged her gently before she released her with a faint smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress skittered before the Snow Empress, and she gave her a peck on her face before she giggled and ran away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was in a terrible situation. One could say that he was in the worst condition that he had ever been in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was just too much energy within his body. What he wanted most was to vent the vast energy out of his body, but he couldn’t do that at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t control his soul power with his spiritual power, because his spiritual power was in a mess in the first place. The Evileye Tyrant King’s spiritual power had already been cleansed, but that spiritual power itself was violent, like it contained a formidable avenging spirit within it. It continued to wreak havoc, and it wanted to dominate Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King had been a formidable soul beast with more than seven hundred thousand years of cultivation! Even though his body was dead, he could still retaliate while drawing his last breath.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s no wonder I didn’t feel any spiritual undulations after his death. He hid his spirit’s strength within his soul ring, and he’s compressed vast amounts of spiritual power inside it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s clear that the Evileye Tyrant King calculated precisely before his death that I had to absorb his soul core, and what he’s trying to do now is possess me! He wants to possess my body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wouldn’t be afraid of the Evileye Tyrant King if Long Xiaoyao hadn’t infused all that soul power into his body. He had the Skydream Iceworm and the Mermaid Princess, and his spiritual power was incredibly powerful in the first place. Huo Yuhao still had his power of emotions, and the Evileye Tyrant King was unworthy of competing with him because he only had his spiritual origin left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Huo Yuhao was in deep trouble right now, because the soul power within his body was revolting! His soul power was revolting to the point where he couldn’t concentrate to deal with the Evileye Tyrant King, which was his biggest problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea was chaotic. The Mermaid Princess and the Skydream Iceworm could barely hold on, and he was in the same situation. His mind was starting to feel groggy. Fortunately, his spiritual soul core was strong enough that the Evileye Tyrant King’s spirit couldn’t truly complete the possession.</span></p>
