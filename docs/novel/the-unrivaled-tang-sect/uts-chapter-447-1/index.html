As the highest-ranked individual in charge of the Star Luo Empire’s intelligence department, she reported directly to the Emperor of the Star Luo Empire. She had put in a lot of effort for the Sun Moon Empire’s own aerial surveillance soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had managed to obtain ordinary aerial surveillance soul tools before. However, those soul tools had self-destruction mechanisms installed within them. Once they were dismantled, they would blow apart. The Star Luo Empire had suffered a lot because of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, it was also her first time seeing this high altitude aerial surveillance soul tool in front of her. She was completely astonished!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Huo Yuhao brought it back, Xu Jiujiu didn’t expect Huo Yuhao to be so quick even though she had high hopes for him. The value of such a soul tool couldn’t be measured on the surface. It would have an important effect on developing the Star Luo Empire’s expertise in soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Duke, are you saying that Wang Yiheng was killed by Huo Yuhao and his comrades?” Xu Jiujiu’s voice sounded more high-pitched. The White Tiger Duke recounted everything he had seen earlier to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao nodded. Not to even mention that Xu Jiujiu was in disbelief, he would also be unconvinced if he didn’t witness it personally!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few Soul Sages and Soul Emperors actually managed to kill a Class 9 soul engineer who was also a Titled Douluo. At the same time, the Empyrean Blaze, which was ranked twelfth among Class 9 soul tools, was also almost destroyed. Such an outcome wouldn’t be surprising if a few Titled Douluo were responsible for it. However, how old were Huo Yuhao and the rest? Their average age might not even be twenty yet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These talents from Shrek Academy demonstrated their strength by performing another miracle. At the same time, they proved their value to all the powerful individuals from the Star Luo Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu was breathing hard, and didn’t make a sound for some time. She couldn’t believe something like that had happened. Tonight was even less peaceful than the previous night.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He really did it. His abilities…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu had always found Huo Yuhao very impressive. She had, on two occasions, witnessed Huo Yuhao’s performances in the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament. In addition, she had even personally fought him before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was only now that she discovered that her past understanding of him really belonged to the past. Right now, Huo Yuhao was beyond her domain of understanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a Soul Sage that wasn’t even twenty years old yet, but he was the one who led a kill mission against a Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Duke, do you know how they did it?” Xu Jiujiu swallowed her saliva and asked with some difficulty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The same question was in heads of the other senior commanders from the Star Luo Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Yueheng and Dai Luoli were standing behind Dai Hao right now. They had also received news of what happened had immediately. Dai Yueheng was now very perplexed. He was also from Shrek Academy, and was also a top-performing student in Shrek Academy’s inner courtyard. However, he was also in disbelief right now! He clearly knew that neither he nor the representative team he had formed with Ma Xiaotao could possibly accomplish something like this. They were at least five years older than Huo Yuhao and the rest, but their overall abilities were far behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao sighed and replied, “I only witnessed what happened at the end. However, I believe that Yuhao and the rest took turns to attack throughout the entire fight. They managed to unleash everyone’s fighting strength to the extreme through an effective rhythm. This caused Wang Yiheng’s power to be continually drained.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He only unleashed his full power at the end. Among all of them, four played very crucial roles. They are Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan, Huo Yuhao and Ji Juechen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He recounted everything that he had seen. When they watched from afar earlier, they managed to catch hold of Xu Sanshi unleashing his Golden Xuanwu’s Domain before using his Turtle God’s Strike to neutralize the Empyrean Blazing Bull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, it was Jiang Nannan’s Soft Bone Lock and Invincible Golden Body, as well as Huo Yuhao’s all-out attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huo Yuhao’s palm strike was the most crucial. The rest were only weakening Wang Yiheng, but Huo Yuhao’s strike completely destroyed Wang Yiheng’s Empyrean Blaze and dealt him a fatal blow. I heard that it was Huo Yuhao’s self-invented soul skill. It even contains the power of his emotions. It should be a self-invented soul skill that’s a combination of his soul and spiritual power. When he unleashed that strike, I could sense a weird force field around his body. I was even unwittingly drawn in. Even though it was night time, it felt as if the sky had changed color when he unleashed that strike. It’s just that everything seemed to have been turned into nothingness just as he unleashed his strike.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A beam of red light glowed from Wang Yiheng’s body. If I’m not wrong, that beam of red light should be for protective purposes. However, it was crushed by Huo Yuhao’s attack before Wang Yiheng was hit. Wang Yiheng’s Empyrean Blaze lost the majority of its control after he was struck. After that, there seemed to be a spear that shot out from Huo Yuhao’s head, which penetrated his skull and dealt him a heavy injury.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At that point, Wang Yiheng’s injuries were already very serious. Then, Ji Juechen appeared and used his sword to stab the wound that Huo Yuhao had created. This fully ended Wang Yiheng’s life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What I noticed was that they coordinated very well with one another, unleashing wave after wave of attacks. They complemented one another very well. I figure that there must be a control-type soul master among them. After that, it was Huo Yuhao’s attack. There wasn’t any evident soul power undulations when he unleashed his attack. However, I could clearly sense that his greatest fighting strength was unleashed at that moment. It was the key to killing Wang Yiheng.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After listening to the White Tiger Duke’s analysis, the Titled Douluo that had also witnessed everything all nodded in agreement. Just like the White Tiger Duke had mentioned, Huo Yuhao seemed to have fused with heaven and earth in that state. It was also his palm strike that completely defeated Wang Yiheng. Even Wang Yiheng wouldn’t have expected that. They were able to succeed partly due to Wang Yiheng’s own complacency. Otherwise, why didn’t he use his Invincible Barrier and soul protective barrier? He must have been very confident in his own attack. It was a pity that his confidence was a reason for his demise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu was stunned, and muttered to herself, “Yuhao, I didn’t expect you to reach such a level already. Duke, if you’re talking about a control-type soul master, that person must be Huo Yuhao. The first time I met him, when he was only twelve or thirteen years old, he was already a control-type soul master. His Spiritual Detection can band his teammates together, and he can share accurate information about the enemy with his teammates. This is very effective in counteracting the fighting strength of the enemy. Dai Yueheng should be the most aware of this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke turned his attention towards his son, and Dai Yueheng immediately nodded and replied, “Her Highness is right. When I first competed in the Soul Dueling Tournament with Huo Yuhao, he always appeared as a control-type soul master. His Spiritual Detection is very strong. It should be even stronger now than it was before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke nodded, and there was an awed look on his face, “No wonder he’s the future Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion! No wonder he can become the youngest elder of Shrek Academy at such a tender age.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu asked, “White Tiger Duke, what should we do next?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold look flashed across the White Tiger Duke’s eyes and he said, “Hang Wang Yiheng’s corpse on a flagpole outside the base for everyone to see. At the same time, I’ll need you to send some people to bring the high altitude aerial surveillance soul tool back for research purposes, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Xu Jiujiu immediately acknowledged his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t interested in the guesses or arrangements of the Star Luo Empire. When he returned into his tent, he immediately entered a cultivation state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His soul power circulated. Although he was greatly drained earlier, his last attack through the Golden Dragon Spear had helped to replenish him by absorbing some of Wang Yiheng’s immense soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon Spear was terrifying in the sense that it could absorb the life energy and soul power of the enemy to replenish the fighting strength of its owner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Huo Yuhao didn’t fully inherit her abilities, he was much more complementary to the Golden Dragon Spear after Wang Qiu’er’s Sacrifice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was even more drained in terms of his spiritual power, especially after he was subjected to the side effects of the Haodong Palm. Right now, his mind was filled with the figure of Wang Dong’er. The pain brought about by his yearning for her could only be understood by him.</span></p>
