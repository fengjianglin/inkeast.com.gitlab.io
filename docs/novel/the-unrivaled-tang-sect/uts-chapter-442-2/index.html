As long as my reverse scale is in you, you can only remain in this world and protect the fortune of the Great Star Dou Forest. After you die, I’ll use some methods to make you transfer the power of destiny to a soul beast, and further the fortune of the Great Star Dou Forest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian looked a little hesitant as he muttered to himself. If not for the fact that he couldn’t use brute force to make destiny submit to him, he would have killed Huo Yuhao long ago. However, the power of destiny could only be transferred willingly, it couldn’t be taken by force. No matter how strong Di Tian was, he couldn’t challenge the laws of the the world. He could only wait while protecting Huo Yuhao...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After snapping out of his contemplative state, Huo Yuhao looked very calm once more. This wasn’t Di Tian’s first time hindering him. However, he had also used his actions to prove to his Spirits that searching for that feeling wasn’t so difficult. This actually wasn’t the second time. More accurately speaking, it was the third time. It was just because he was too invested earlier on, which stopped him from controlling his own sensations. Otherwise, he might not have been discovered by Di Tian this time, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze suddenly turned sharp. He summoned all his soul power and poured it into his flying-type soul tool. Suddenly, all of his soul tool’s ports started to circulate at full speed, thrusting him forward like a streak of flowing light. He charged towards the Ming Dou Mountain Range at lightning-quick speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was still five thousand meters in the air right now, and finally tapped into his own soul power to fly. It was also now that he finally felt the burden of moving at such a high altitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was still using his soul power to propel his soul tool, but he was drained three times as quickly as normal. His flying-type soul tool seemed to be affected by the low temperature and thin air, and was quickly drained. At the same time, Huo Yuhao had no choice but to use his soul power to change the speed of his blood circulation in order to maintain the necessary functions of his own body. Concurrently, he filtered the thin air and absorbed what he could into his body. These processes drained him even further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flying at an altitude of five thousand meters, he was naturally unafraid of being spotted by the Sun Moon Empire. However, Huo Yuhao clearly understood that even a Titled Douluo couldn’t withstand being at such a high altitude for long. If not for his flying-type soul tool, he couldn’t possibly fly here, given his abilities as a Soul Sage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In less than half a minute, Huo Yuhao’s soul power was drained by almost twenty percent. If he continued flying like this, he couldn’t possibly reach the Ming Dou Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His butterfly-winged flying-type soul tool’s ports stopped working under Huo Yuhao’s control. He couldn’t sustain this any longer. If he continued to do so, he couldn’t possibly complete his mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he shut the ports, he continued to maintain his flying speed. However, he was slowly descending as he glided towards the Ming Dou Mountain Range. This had always been his plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Descending from such a great height was completely in contrast with ascending into the sky. The pressure that he had to bear was naturally dipping, and he didn’t need to use his soul power to fly anymore. He was in a much better position now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao continuously used his spiritual detection to observe everything below him. At the same time, he kept an eye on the detector on his wrist. Above three thousand meters was a safe height to remain at, a height where he would still remain undetected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This surveillance mission involved a few critical risks. Comparatively speaking, getting closer to the Ming Dou Mountain Range was actually the safest part. This was because Huo Yuhao could remove any soul power undulations by shutting his flying-type soul tool off and using his Imitation to conceal himself. With the help of his Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass, his body temperature was also regulated to a temperature identical to the air. Unless oscillation detectors were used, there weren’t any soul tools that could possibly detect his presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Oscillation detectors were usually very short-range. They couldn’t possibly detect anything three thousand meters up in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, there were two different times that would be the most dangerous. The first would be when Huo Yuhao unleashed his Spiritual Detection and tried to survey the area around the Death God.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second period would be when he retreated. During the process of retreating, he would need some thrust, which could only be achieved through unleashing his soul power. His Imitation couldn’t possibly remove all traces of his soul power undulations, it could only conceal them to the best of his ability. As for the Sun Moon Empire’s soul power detectors, Huo Yuhao wasn’t certain whether he would be detectable by them. After all, he hadn’t obtained any information about the soul tools that the Sun Moon Empire had installed in the Ming Dou Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he drew closer and closer, he was also descending through the air. From five thousand to four thousand meters, he was able to see lights coming from the ground as the pressure on him lessened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Star Luo Empire started to launch their attack to cover the traces of his surveillance. Balls of light could be seen being unleashed toward the Ming Dou Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These balls of lights also helped Huo Yuhao determine the position of the Ming Dou Mountain Range, and more accurately locate his target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even given Huo Yuhao’s abilities as a Soul Sage and a possessor of twin martial souls, he found it difficult to fly without using a flying-type soul tool, so he was very cautious in the control of his butterfly-winged flying-type soul tool. During the process of gliding, he used the wind currents to maintain his altitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, the highest peak of the Ming Dou Mountain Range came into his field of view just as the detector on his wrist indicated that he was at an altitude of three thousand six hundred meters. More accurately speaking, the highest peak came within the range of his Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was roughly the distance he had planned for. Huo Yuhao used his Spirit Eyes to observe his surroundings and made a simple estimation. He was now around eight to ten kilometers away from the highest mountain peak of the Ming Dou Mountain Range. Ten kilometers was the upper limit of his unidirectional detection. However, he was high up in the sky, which affected the accuracy of his detection to some degree, and he could only make a conservative estimate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His butterfly wings curved in the air to aid him in gliding with the wind currents. Huo Yuhao controlled his flight and tried his best to drift in mid-air. On his forehead, his Eye of Destiny slowly opened under the stimulus of his spiritual power. Clear rose-gold light flashed slightly, and a huge vertically-pupiled eye appeared behind Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To raise the effectiveness of his Spiritual Detection, he needed the help of his Eye of Destiny!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without any hindrance, Huo Yuhao’s first and second soul rings lit up at the same time. Under the effect of his Imitation, all the light that he released was assimilated into his surroundings. It made him look like a ball of air that could generate soul power and spiritual undulations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His immense spiritual power cut through the sky like an invisible ray of light. It went straight toward the highest peak of the Ming Dou Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to his understanding of the Death God, the Death God’s effective range was roughly five thousand meters, coincidentally outside the range of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection. In this case, he wouldn’t be in much danger even if he was discovered on his way back. After all, a Titled Douluo would still need some time to catch up with Huo Yuhao, given the speed he was capable of. By the time that happened, he would have returned to the territory controlled by the Star Luo Empire, and people would be there to reinforce him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao’s expression turned serious after a brief moment. This was because he was stunned to discover that his Spiritual Detection was blocked off by an invisible barrier when it was only a thousand meters from the highest peak. After this, his Spiritual Detection dissipated. The barrier was even shaking slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t some protective barrier created from soul power. It was a real, spiritual barrier!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strong spiritual power. Don’t tell me that this was generated from a soul tool?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although there were soul tools that could enhance one’s spiritual power, they were very rare. Furthermore, the extent of the increase was limited. Otherwise, Huo Yuhao would have equipped himself with one. Even though his spiritual power didn’t penetrate the barrier earlier, he could still clearly sense that a massive spiritual barrier covered the entire highest peak of the Ming Dou Mountain Range. There weren’t any loopholes. This meant that he had to overcome this barrier before he could perform any surveillance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t guess who had erected such a powerful &nbsp;and sturdy spiritual barrier. At the very least, a spiritual-type soul master with the powers of an eight-ringed Soul Douluo was needed to mount such a defense. More importantly, the area that it covered was simply too huge. The amount of spiritual power drained to erect such a spiritual barrier had to be incredible!</span></p>
