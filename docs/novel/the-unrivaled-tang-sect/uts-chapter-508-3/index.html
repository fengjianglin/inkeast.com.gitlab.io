<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every soul master’s way of cultivation, especially their circulation path, was their biggest secret. Even though Huo Yuhao might not have been able to find out much about Tang Wutong’s circulation path, being given permission to inject his soul power into her was already an immense hint as to how she felt about him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing what Tang Wutong said, Huo Yuhao revealed an expression of regret. He really regretted attempting to verify Tang Wutong’s identity. If he had not tried to do so, he could still live happily in the illusion that she was actually Wang Dong’er… even if “Wang Dong’er” refused to be with him. But his attempt to verify her identity completely destroyed the illusion, and left Huo Yuhao with no hope. He completely gave up on Tang Wutong after realizing that she was not Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Tang Wutong paused, Zhang Lexuan interjected, “Tang Wutong, are you done with your confession?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong shook her head fervently and clarified, “Not yet. Let me finish what I have to say.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan frowned, “Then you’d better hurry. If you take up too much time, it would be unfair to the others.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I understand.” Tang Wutong replied, before hastily shifting her gaze back to Huo Yuhao. “I’m running out of time, but there’s so much I want to say to you. Yuhao, I am standing before you today just like I did back then, when you chose me even before you saw my appearance. Can you take me with you today? I have so much to say to you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stared calmly at Tang Wutong, but his heart was wrenching with pain.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong… Why must you bring up such things…? You are not Dong’er, and never will be! Even though you may look like her, you are ultimately not her… How can I take you with me？</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan announced, “Alright! Now that everyone is done, it’s now Yuhao’s turn to make his decision. Yuhao, the time is now yours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded at Zhang Lexuan and Han Ruoruo before turning his attention to the four ladies before him. He sighed and apologized, “I’m deeply grateful for the attention and affection which all of you have showered upon me. But to be very honest, I didn’t intend to come today. I already have a certain lady in my heart… a girl who I met at my previous Fated Blind Date. We met each other back then and got together. However, something peculiar happened to her, and she has disappeared. Even now, I’m unable to find her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, this doesn’t change the fact that my heart can only contain her and no one else. Until the end of my life, I can only love her and her only. The only reason why I attended this Blind Date is because all single students of the inner courtyard must attend. Because of this, I’m terribly sorry for what I have put all of you through. Bai Se and Su Tong, feel free to look for me for a duel whenever either of you wish. I’m open to such challenges.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, he turned around to look at Zhang Lexuan before saying, “Eldest senior sister, let’s call it a day. I will take my leave now and not interfere with the other students’ blind date.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finishing his sentence, Huo Yuhao nodded at Zhang Lexuan and Han Ruoruo and turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hold on!” At this very moment, three voices simultaneously demanded that he stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned around, and realized that the three voices belonged to Bai Se, Su Tong, and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Se spoke anxiously, “You can’t leave like this. Do you know how hard it is to bump into you in person? If I were to miss this opportunity to spar with you today, I’m not sure how long I would have to wait before I got to see you in person again. Let’s just spar today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tong gave him a cold sneer. “That’s right. Even if you didn’t choose us, you should at the very least spar with us before leaving. I want to prove to everyone present that I am stronger than you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After both of them clarified their reasons, it was Tang Wutong’s turn to speak, but she merely bit her lip and kept quiet. No one knew what was on her mind. But slowly, she looked back up at Huo Yuhao with a determined stare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao frowned as memories of Wang Dong’er were awakened by this Fated Blind Date. Burdened by the heartache from those memories, all Huo Yuhao wanted to do was leave this Blind Date and find a quiet corner to hide. However, these ladies were overbearing, and they were getting on his nerves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay. Since both of you are so interested in challenging me, why don’t I perform two moves, and both of you try to replicate them? If either of you can replicate them, I will willingly concede defeat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s voice was not particularly loud, but everyone present, regardless of whether they were above the lake or all the way at the lakeside, could hear him clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that very instant, the students from the outer courtyard stood up in unison in excitement. They were about to witness Huo Yuhao — the owner of the Eyes of the Asura, the Academy’s youngest ever member of the Sea God’s Pavilion, the founder of the Spirit Pagoda, and the inventor of Spirits — perform before their very eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was he really going to demonstrate his abilities in front of everyone? Oh, what a sight that would be! The students from the Outer Courtyard had long wanted to see Spirits — an important lesson module within Shrek Academy which had been made famous by word of mouth — with their own eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nothing could beat watching the inventor use what he had invented, right? Everyone had huge expectations for the upcoming display from Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when everyone was hyped up for what they were about to see, Huo Yuhao took a step forward and left the lilypad beneath him. As he stood calmly above the surface of the lake, a thick circle of ice with a diameter of roughly two meters formed beneath his feet and took his weight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded politely towards Bai Se before gazing up at the sky. At that very instant, his eyes appeared to lose focus, as though his attention had drifted off and away into the skies. However, this only lasted for a short while before a massive change followed. An incredibly strong sense of nostalgia rippled out into the surroundings from him. His emotions appeared to be pouring out of his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took a step forward off the ice into the empty space before him. Huo Yuhao levitated above the lake as his soul rings started to rise from his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every soul ring’s color was pristine and free from any form of adulteration. The white, black, gold and red rings were all equally impressive as all seven rings shone brilliantly with their individual colors. The energy coming off of Huo Yuhao’s body was way beyond what any normal seven-ringed Soul Sage could produce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outer courtyard students by the lake were not able to differentiate it, but the inner courtyard students, who were a lot nearer, were all stupefied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he only had seven soul rings, Huo Yuhao seemed to be giving off the energy levels of an eight-ringed Soul Sage!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unless...he has already become an eight-ringed Soul Sage? But if that is the case, why would he only have seven rings?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao would not give away the answer. Before anyone knew it, he suddenly struck a fist up towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that very instant, his whole body turned golden. In fact, the soul rings surrounding him all turned golden as well. The intent from his punch left a deep impression in everyone’s hearts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone present could feel a powerful feeling of nostalgia surging from the depths of their hearts. Images of the ones they missed the most formed in everyone’s minds simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some missed their mothers, while others missed their fathers. But what was common between those mental images was the love they all had for the ones whom they missed the most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The power of that fist’s intent was so strong that even the Titled Douluo on the ship were affected by the yearning for one’s loved one. At that very instant, everyone, including Elder Xuan, Yan Shaozhe, and the other powerful Douluo, had their emotions affected to different extents by Huo Yuhao’s move.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately following this moving performance, a powerful golden glow exploded into the air as his golden fist transformed into a pillar of golden radiance shooting straight up into the heavens, illuminating the entirety of the Sea God’s Lake, and the whole of the Sea God’s Island.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that very instant, all of Shrek Academy was painted in gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Se, who was standing just opposite Huo Yuhao, was completely stunned by what she had just seen. How was she going to replicate such a powerful move executed by the guy who was floating in mid-air before her? The move Huo Yuhao had performed contained a scary amount of spiritual intent, and Bai Se was certain that she would be severely injured or even killed if such a blow landed on her. She knew very well that even if she were currently at the Soul Sage level, instead of her current Soul Emperor level, she would not have been able to take the blow!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why is the intensity of the soul power fluctuations radiating from his body beyond that of an ordinary Soul Sage? Is…Is he still human?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this very instant, Bai Se realized Huo Yuhao’s figure was indelibly imprinted in her mind. His magnificent golden figure was now an immovable image in the depths of her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the golden color in the sky gradually faded away, the students from Shrek Academy slowly collected themselves after witnessing Huo Yuhao’s move. However, just when they thought they had recovered from the shock, they were met with another unbelievable sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, it appeared that something in the sky had once again surprised them. There was another person. Someone completely golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This person’s silhouette was incredibly beautiful. Her long dress weighed down perfectly, her long hair covered her back gracefully, while her beauty glowed in a gentle yet alluring way. She appeared to be looking into the distance, as though she were waiting or yearning for someone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The students from the outer courtyard could not see it clearly, but those from the inner courtyard who were participating in the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date were shocked, because the levitating person looked exactly like Tang Wutong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only those who had seen Wang Dong’er before knew that that person was not Tang Wutong. Wang Dong’er, the former Goddess of Light, used to have wavy hair, but the person levitating in the air had straight hair. But yes, that person was none other than Wang Dong’er… the person who had stolen away Huo Yuhao’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene was utterly breathtaking: Wang Dong’er was gazing down at Huo Yuhao from high up in the air, while Huo Yuhao returned her stare lovingly from a lower altitude. The entire Sea God’s Lake was theirs, and everyone else present was invisible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one wanted to let out a scream of excitement or exhilaration anymore. While they were all shocked beyond belief, they did not want to spoil the beautiful scene, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er’s “reunion”, taking place before their eyes.</span></p>
