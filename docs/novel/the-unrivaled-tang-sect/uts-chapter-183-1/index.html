 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu thought that he was seeing things when Huo Yuhao’s body slightly moved. After all, he had waited too long. It was half a year! Huo Yuhao had sat there without moving for half a year.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">However, Fan Yu soon realized that he wasn’t seeing things. That’s because he saw the dust on him falling to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">He had sat there for half a year. No one dared to touch him either for fear of disrupting his cultivation. Huo Yuhao wasn’t just covered in dust. He was coated with an oxide layer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">He was like a clay figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu stood up hurriedly and took a few steps forward. He stared at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao indeed moved. His body slightly trembled and dust kept on falling from him. The oxide layer on him also started to crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu was a little nervous. He retrieved a jade bottle. It was his first time seeing someone enter deep meditation for half a year. Elder Xuan once instructed him not to offer Huo Yuhao any food or water immediately after he awoke. He had to consume the medicinal fluid contained within this bottle to strengthen himself first as his body was at its weakest condition at this point.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">His body starting to tremble more violently. He seemed to be trying to open his eyes but didn’t have the strength to.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu didn’t dare to touch him. He could only hold his breath and watch. Huo Yuhao had grown much thinner after half a year such that he resembled a branch. After all, his body wasn’t nourished as he sat there. He could only deplete his body reserves like a wild beast that hibernated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body became still after a while. Not only was Fan Yu astonished, he was also extremely anxious and didn’t know what to do. Huo Yuhao let out a slight groan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah……” He groaned, and his body shook suddenly. The oxide layer on his body cracked and he finally opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Even though only a slit was formed, and dust flew around his body, the tent suddenly surfaced with a layer of weird light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">That was a dim golden color. Fan Yu only heard a buzzing sound in his mind that resonated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body moved again and he finally managed to lift his head slightly. Fan Yu managed to see his eyes now.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Beautiful eyes!&nbsp;</span></em><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Amidst the clear golden, his eyes emitted a gentle light. Although it was just a pair of eyes, Fan Yu felt as if he was looking at an ocean.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu was completely shocked. He couldn’t help it as he said, “Yuhao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s lips moved slightly. His lips had already stuck together after such a long time. He struggled a little before tearing them apart. A layer of dry skin was peeled off and revealed his flesh.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher.” Huo Yuhao shut his eyes after muttering one word. His body also fell to the side like he was a statue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu couldn’t let him fall and quickly supported him. He could sense Huo Yuhao’s rigidity, but his cold body had developed some warmth by now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu rushed to break the jade bottle. He carefully poured the fluid into Huo Yuhao’s mouth. While Huo Yuhao was very weak now, his mind was clear. He struggled as he swallowed the fluid that reeked of a heavy medicinal smell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">The fluid quickly circulated around his body. A wave of heat swept and caused Huo Yuhao to feel much better.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, he had already awoken when his body first jerked. It was just that he was in a tormented state then.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt extremely weak when his mind returned to his body. He was so weak that he couldn’t even lift a finger. His body was pitch-dark, and he couldn’t even see a shred of soul power. The blood in his passageways was circulating at an unbelievably slow speed. His muscles were also as stiff as a rock.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Deep meditation should have increased my abilities! However, why am I in such a pathetic state?&nbsp;</span></em><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt very helpless now. It wasn’t his first time entering deep meditation for a long time. The last time he did so was in the Sea God’s Pavilion. As he recalled now, the deep meditation that he did in the Sea God’s Pavilion didn’t cause any burden on his body. It was possibly because of the Golden Tree. With the nourishment of the Golden Tree, the internal courtyard disciples that underwent deep meditation didn’t experience such a problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu also didn’t dare to pour his soul power into Huo Yuhao’s body to help him readjust. He knew that Huo Yuhao’s abilities had increased after seeing the expression in his eyes. It was just that his body wasn’t in good condition right now, but he could only rely on himself to readjust. Any external interference might lead to problems since his body was very weak.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">He carried Huo Yuhao as this wasn’t a suitable place for him to recuperate. Fan Yu carried him and left the place.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher……immerse…hot water…” Huo Yuhao’s lips moved slightly. After consuming the medicinal fluid, a warm feeling soon engulfed his body. He managed to restore some of his energy and muttered a few words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu immediately understood what he meant. He quickly brought him back to his dormitory room and filled his bathtub with hot water. After that, he placed Huo Yuhao inside the bathtub without stripping him. It was only his head that was out of the water.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">His body was soaked in the warm water and the oxide layer was slowly broken down. After a while, the water had already turned black. Huo Yuhao’s body seemed to soften as he soaked in the warm water.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu changed the water before removing his torn and tattered clothes. Huo Yuhao was immersed in the water again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">With the medicine circulating and warm water soaking his body, Huo Yuhao felt much more comfortable. His body wasn’t as stiff as before and he sat more relaxedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">The water was changed five times. After an hour, Fan Yu fed Huo Yuhao another bottle of medicine again. This enabled him to lie straight in the bathtub and his breathing became more and more normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu was also soaked in perspiration and snapped, “Rascal, you deep meditated for half a year. I was almost killed by the fatigue from taking care of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could open his eyes now. The golden in his eyes had dissipated and was restored to black.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher, thank you.” Huo Yuhao’s voice was shaking slightly. Tears also started to stream from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">After half a year, Fan Yu appeared to have gone through a lot and his beard had grown in a disheveled manner. He seemed to have grown much older.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu chortled and said, “Alright, I’m just whining. I’m pleased since you’re awake. How are you? Do you feel better?</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sobbed as he said, “I’m much better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m just a little hungry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">“Hungry? Even if you’re, you’ve to bear the hunger. Elder Xuan said that you can’t eat anything for three days after you awake from your deep meditation. You can only consume some medicinal fluid and you can drink a little water tomorrow. You can only start a liquid diet after three days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly, “Teacher, I’m not that weak right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu said, “Look at yourself. You’re almost a bag of bones now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, it was clear to see that Huo Yuhao had grown much thinner after the dirt on his body was scrubbed off. Fortunately, he was initially very developed. Even though he had become much thinner, it only made his muscle definition clearer. While he still couldn’t use his strength, his body wasn’t as stiff as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu helped Huo Yuhao to clean his body. He lifted him out of the bathtub before drying him and putting him onto his bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, have a good sleep. I’m relieved that you’re awake. I’ll also go and take a bath.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t hang on any further and immediately entered deep sleep after Fan Yu left.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Fan Yu wasn’t lying to him. In the next three days, he wasn’t given any food. He was only offered some water and medicine. In the meantime, Fan Yu only told He Caitou about this. He didn’t tell anyone else that Huo Yuhao had awoken.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could finally sit up after three days. He sat cross-legged as he meditated. His soul power also slowly restored.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately discovered that there was coagulation in his passageways. Not only did his cultivation not improve, it even seemed to have fallen. Fortunately, he already had four rings. At that level, he just needed to smoothen out his passageways before his cultivation could restore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">He took even longer to recover than what he expected. When he returned to his dormitory room secretly, it was already six months later.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">After he smoothened out his passageways, he discovered that his body was different from before. The half a year’s worth of deep meditation wasn’t wasted. Although his soul power didn’t increase temporarily and only restored to half its peak six months ago, he realized that his passageways, muscles, bones and even fluid were all coated with a layer of dim golden. This golden aura was similar to his Spiritual Sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">This also meant that his Boundless Ocean had combined with his body once. The most evident change of this combination was that his soul power circulation had been boosted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline">As Huo Yuhao’s second martial soul was the Ultimate Ice, the burden on his body was quite huge. Furthermore, it was much purer than ordinary soul power. That’s why his soul power circulation was greatly restricted during his cultivation process. This was also the reason why Huo Yuhao’s cultivation increased very slowly even though he had a stable foundation.</span></p>
