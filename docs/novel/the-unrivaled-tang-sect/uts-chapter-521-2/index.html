 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan said, “You shouldn’t be thinking about the Yin Yang Complement. It’s too dangerous. While your body is strong, you can’t compare yourself to the Beast God. After all, humans and soul beasts are biologically different. That’s why you shouldn’t go and take the risk. Just follow the principle of Resonance to cultivate. You possess Ultimate Ice and twin martial souls. As long as your second soul core forms successfully and you work towards your third soul core to become an Ultimate Douluo, it’s not impossible for you to reach Di Tian’s abilities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it’s already so difficult to form my second soul core, what about my third soul core? I’m afraid no one in the history of Shrek Academy has cultivated a third soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan then provided more advice to Huo Yuhao. He revealed everything that he had experienced to Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, you just need to remember what I said. Don’t attempt a breakthrough anytime soon. It’s very dangerous. I must be around to protect you when you try. This is so that the risk you are facing is at its lowest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan said, “The mission will take place in ten days. Meet the rest of the people who are going over the following days. You are very familiar with the meeting place, which is the Ming Dou Mountain Range. Both of you can proceed there first and rendezvous at the White Tiger Duke’s camp. When everyone is there, you’ll set off. Remember what I said. Both of you are there to help only. Aren’t you very good at concealment? Don’t reveal all your abilities. Don’t become a target. That applies for both you and Wutong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Xuan, don’t worry. To protect Wutong, I won’t take the risk.” Huo Yuhao assured Elder Xuan once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t too worried about this mission. In fact, he was a little skeptical of such a mission. Was it so easy to assassinate the leader of an empire? Furthermore, whether they would like to admit it or not, the combined power of the Sun Moon Empire was the greatest in all the empires of the Douluo Continent. He was very familiar with the defensive strength of their soul tools. Assassinating Xu Tianran would be extremely difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, since Elder Xuan let him go, he still had to make this trip. Huo Yuhao wasn’t against it. However, he didn’t hold any hope of achieving any results on this mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he wasn’t purely there for a show, he made up his mind to regard safety as the main priority. He wasn’t going to take any unnecessary risks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With their brand-new Haodong Power, Tang Wutong and his fighting strength was much greater than before. Along with the fact that his survival ability on a battlefield was very great and he had a wealth of experience, he was very confident of preserving his own life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to the Tang Sect, Huo Yuhao immediately pulled Tang Wutong back to his room to meditate. He could only focus during his meditation. He needed to fully understand what Elder Xuan was describing earlier, and turn his experience into comprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the next few days, Huo Yuhao did some preparatory work. It was only on the ninth day that he and Tang Wutong bade goodbye to the rest of the Tang Sect. They quietly left Shrek City and proceeded towards the Star Luo Empire’s borders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering the borders of the Star Luo Empire, Huo Yuhao was astonished to find out that there were aerial surveillance soul tools in the Star Luo Empire. Although there weren’t many of them, it was better to have some than not to have any at all. Evidently, Shrek Academy wasn’t the only one that had intensified their research in this area. After suffering during the war, the three empires of the original Douluo Continent also strengthened their research in this area. It wasn’t possible to catch up to the Sun Moon Empire, but it was better than nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong held hands as they flew through the sky. Their soul power circulated in their bodies, and they both had a flying-type soul tool on their backs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s flying-type soul tools were made by Huo Yuhao personally. They were Class 9 soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to other Class 9 soul engineers, Huo Yuhao’s greatest advantage was the speed with which he produced Class 9 soul tools. He didn’t design these two flying-type soul tools. Rather, Xuan Ziwen was the one who designed them. He only produced them, which took five months in total. Although they weren’t the best Class 9 soul tools, they were definitely exquisite work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were dim-blue. Such a color helped the soul tools blend into the sky. At such a level, remaining hidden was more important than the superficial design of the soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As their circulated their soul power, the speed of their flying-type soul tools was immediately increased to the speed of sound. Of course, the length of time that they could maintain such a speed, as well as how quick they were depleted, was directly related to the volume of their soul power. With Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s current cultivation, they could only maintain such a sonic speed for about fifteen minutes. However, if they used their Haodong Power, that time would be increased to an hour. An hour was sufficient for them to cross half the empire. This was why Huo Yuhao was very confident that they could protect themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Class 9 soul tools would definitely not just have one ability. These two flying-type soul tools were equipped with soul thrusters. If these thrusters were boosted, they would be able to travel up to three times the speed of sound. Even that could only be maintained for a moment, there were many occasions that unexpected effects could be achieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, not just anyone could use such an ability. This was because the burden on one’s body as a result of using this ability was very great. Any soul master with less than seven rings would blow apart due to the immense pressure when traveling at such a great speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were both talented. Tang Wutong was already a Titled Douluo, while Huo Yuhao was at Rank 89. Both of them could use such an ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen called these two flying-type soul tools Supersonic Wings. Xuan Ziwen was even proud enough to claim that these two flying-type soul tools were capable of being ranked among the top ten flying-type soul tools on the continent. This was because Class 9 soul engineers would rarely focus their energy on producing such soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To produce a Class 9 soul tool, a Class 9 soul engineer must be willing to sacrifice a lot of energy. At the same time, he must possess sufficient resources too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, Shrek Academy and the Tang Sect didn’t have a lot of rare metals. However, as time passed, the development and prosperity of Shrek City attracted a lot of businessmen. This provided Shrek City and the Tang Sect with a lot of new resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tang Sect’s soul tools were also being sold. Soul tools were very profitable. By trading soul tools for rare metals, the Tang Sect managed to gather sufficient resources. While the Sun Moon Empire had many Class 9 soul engineers, the demand for resources was also very high. However, only Xuan Ziwen and Huo Yuhao required resources in Shrek City. This was why all the top-grade materials were all with them, and enough to support their production demands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong maintained one-fourth the speed of sound as they flew. This was already very quick, and it was also a speed that ensured that they would remain in their best condition. With the circulation of their Haodong Power, they could maintain a balance between the depletion and restoration of their abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Wutong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Tang Wutong glanced at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao squinted and said, “What would you think if I chose the Yin Yang Complement to cultivate my second soul core?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was astonished and replied, “Yuhao, don’t take the risk! Didn’t Elder Xuan mention that it’s very dangerous?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “It is, but the benefits are great too. If I succeed, I believe I can become as strong as a Transcendent Douluo when I become a Titled Douluo. I still remember how Di Tian’s strength descended upon me when I faced Ye Xishui at the Ming Dou Mountain Range. I clearly felt that his soul power appeared in the form of soul cores. It was extremely strong. Every streak of his soul power was forcefully compressed. He could even force the Death God Douluo away although my body was very weak back then. In the future, I will need to fight the Beast God. If my second soul core is weaker than his, it’ll be very difficult for me to challenge him in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong creased her brows. “However, it’s too dangerous. Furthermore, even if you use Resonance to cultivate your second soul core, you can still cultivate a third soul core in the future! When that happens, you can still challenge the Beast God with three soul cores. In addition, why do you need to challenge the Beast God?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and replied, “I have my own difficulties. Di Tian gave me a piece of his reverse scale. He says that it protects me, but it’s actually spying on me. Once my future cultivation reaches a certain standard, or once I develop some kind of special understanding, it’ll interfere with me. To remove this reverse scale, I need to defeat Di Tian. Otherwise, I won’t be able to reach the peak in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he opened the buttons at the front of his shirt and revealed the piece of reverse scale to Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Tang Wutong saw he pitch-black reverse scale, an angry look flashed across her eyes. “Di Tian, hmph!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao grabbed her hand and said, “This is why I need to choose the best method at every stage of my cultivation. It’s only then that I can challenge him. After all, Di Tian has dominated the continent for years. There’s a reason why he’s the strongest.”</span></p>
