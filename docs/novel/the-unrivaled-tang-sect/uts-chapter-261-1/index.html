She understood now, the Delicate Silk Immortal had made thing very clear. If Huo Yuhao hadn’t chosen to risk his life to ingest that herb, they would probably have faced an all-out assault from the plant-type soul beasts around the Icefire Yin Yang Well. There was no need to discuss the other plants around them, as the hundred-thousand year Delicate Silk Immortal herself wasn’t a force that they could deal with. In other words, Huo Yuhao’s impulsiveness had actually saved their lives!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s expression was calm. His spiritual sea had been boosted once more, and his mind had become more transparent and clearer than before. That outcome was something that he had guessed would happen, so it didn’t come as a surprise to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh and said, “It seems like I’ve been blessed with a fortuitous opportunity among all the dangers and perils. That means, You You, I don’t have to thank you. What I want to know is, what test will I have to go through after this? What test will I have to complete to obtain that book?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal puffed indignantly and said, “You should still thank me. Look, the Fullmoon Piercing Autumn Dew I chose for you is so compatible with you. Even though the Fullmoon Piercing Autumn Dew can’t be considered the best magical herb around here, it’s still ranked amongst the immortal herbs, and it’s also one of the most appropriate herbs for you in this place. Furthermore, it’s the easiest to absorb. I didn’t let you feel any pain or suffering at all!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao forced a laugh and said, “But I’ve sustained a lot of emotional pain. Alright, thank you, then. You can tell me about the test I have to go through now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal was satisfied as she said, “That’s better. The test before this has proven that your personality is trustworthy. That means, the subsequent test will be about your abilities. You can’t protect this book even if you have it if you’re not strong enough, yes? Therefore, according to what that person said, you have to display sufficient ability before you can take this book. You will have to fight against a soul beast suitable for your level to prove that you have sufficient strength. This combat…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait, can you get to the point?” Huo Yuhao had no choice but to interrupt the Delicate Silk Immortal, as she was just too long-winded. If he were to let her continue like this, he would probably start feeling dizzy by the time there was a conclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal grunted and said, “It hasn’t been easy for me to find someone to talk to, and you’re not going to let me talk more? Do you have any courtesy left in you? Hmph, I will choose a strong one for you, then. Ah Jiao, Ah Jiao, are you there? Please answer me if you are!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ah Jiao?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Huo Yuhao’s eyes focused, and a strange event occurred. The four pupils in his eyes flickered at the same time, and his dual pupils fused together, with the purple pupil behind and his black pupil in front. The purple pupil was slightly larger, and it appeared as if his black pupil had a purple light around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao released his Spirit Eyes, and purple and black light sparkled at the same time. If one didn’t inspect them closely, one would only be able to see that his eyes had become entirely purple-golden. He hadn’t released his Purple Demon Eyes, and yet his eyes were already purple-gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah Jiao, Ah Jiao, please answer me! Otherwise, I’m going to disturb you.” The Delicate Silk Immortal’s petals began to flap around as she spoke, and a white streak of light appeared from the white part of the lake before condensing in the air as ice crystals. The crystals instantly lined up in a formation as they pushed towards the center of the shore on the red side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re so irritating, You You, you garrulous thing. You’re interrupting my pleasant dreams again!” an intensely displeased voice was finally heard. It was also a female voice. However, her voice was a lot brighter and crisper, and she didn’t have You You’s tenderness. Her voice sounded a little more... valiant?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A red sphere lit up on the red lake’s shore in the distance, and Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er could finally see where this other enormous talking flower was located.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This plant was completely fiery-red. It didn’t really look like a flower, and was instead extremely tall. It was almost ten feet tall, while the open flower was slightly smaller than the Delicate Silk Immortal in diameter, and in the shape of a cabbage. Its entire body seemed like it had been sculpted from red rubies. It glowed once more, and the temperature of the air inside the valley rose a little bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er were both highly resistant to heat, but they could still feel heatwaves smacking them in the face, and they instinctively channeled their soul power to fight against them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal said, “Ah Jiao, can’t you see that we have visitors? You shall conduct this assessment. I can lift a burden off my chest if he can pass this test.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The plant referred to as Ah Jiao answered, “What burden do you have to lift? Isn’t it just about the crystals that we have cultivated for many years? I sincerely hope that nobody comes to visit us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal giggled and said, “What’s wrong with that? We don’t have any use for the crystals even if we keep them. Furthermore, he may not even pass your test. Without that person’s help all those years ago, we would have ceased to exist. Why do you have to be so petty? If you are that unwilling, then I will let Aniseed do it. This will prove that Aniseed is more powerful than you are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nonsense! How is that scoundrel stronger than me? It’s obvious that I’m stronger, so you shut up! Come here, little boy, and let me teach you a lesson. Please bugger off from this place as soon as you lose.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fiery-red plant trembled, and a red beam of light soared from her body into the sky. A strange scene appeared – the dense vegetation in the valley suddenly opened a path as the plants on the ground separated to either side, and a path was created all the way from the Delicate Silk Immortal to where the fiery-red plant was located.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal said to Huo Yuhao, “Go, go! Ah Jiao’s temper isn’t so good, and she is known as the Blazing Delicate Apricot. She’s a fire-type immortal herb, and she’s extremely hot. Furthermore, you will be affected by the Blazing Sunspring when you’re fighting over there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly and said, “She is a hundred-thousand year soul beast, and I only have five soul rings. She has every advantage possible, doesn’t that mean I’m just throwing my life away if I carry on with this test?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal said, “Are you stupid? I never said that you have to defeat her. All you have to do is pass the test. Quickly, now! You cannot ask me how you can pass this test, as everyone does it differently. It’s all up to you now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao knew that he couldn’t back down at a time like this. Furthermore, for some reason, his other senses had risen to another level after his Spirit Eyes evolved, and he could even detect a little bit of another person’s thoughts and feelings. For instance, he could feel intense worry and anxiety from Wang Qiu’er beside him, while he didn’t feel any hostility or evil intentions from the Delicate Silk Immortal. It felt like this large flower and the plants around them no longer harbored any hostility or aggression towards them after he had passed the first test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was naturally a lot more confident than before with this realization. He nodded in Wang Qiu’er’s direction before he widened his stride and stepped onto the path that the plants had opened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er hurriedly attempted to follow him, but the plants before her immediately closed up and sealed off her path. Voluminous vines swept into the sky and transformed into a barricade that prevented her from moving forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can’t go. This is a test that he has to face by himself!” the Delicate Silk Immortal’s voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er shot a cold glare at her and said, “Have you forgotten what I said before this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uh… don’t be like that. Okay, okay, I’ll just tell you secretly. No danger will come to him even if he fails the test, as everybody is now treating him like a friend after he passed the personality test. Come, chat with me. The two of you can leave in peace even if he doesn’t pass this test.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er glanced at her. She wasn’t afraid that the flower was lying to her, and so she decided to sit down on the spot. However, she didn’t utter a single sound, let alone chat with the Delicate Silk Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal was becoming a little bored and dejected. Her large pink flower began to droop as she muttered under her breath, “You’re not interesting at all. You think you possess…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut up!” Wang Qiu’er fired off another fiery glare as golden light erupted and an intimidating look flowed from her pinkish-blue eyes. The plants around her arched backward conspicuously, as if they had been blown back by a gust of strong wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal said hurriedly, “Alright, alright! Calm down, calm down! I’ll just stop talking...”</span></p>

He knew that he was no match for her, but according to what the Delicate Silk Immortal had said, he didn’t have to defeat her. Since that was the case, then all he could do was give everything he had.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao stepped forward steadily and quickly followed the path to where the Blazing Delicate Apricot was located.</span></p>

Not a single plant grew within two hundred feet around her, and the plants that lived beyond two hundred feet were mostly red, or close to red. There was no question that they were all fire-type plants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t know much about this mystical place, but he had been observing everything around him ever since he had arrived. He had discovered through his observations that the plants in this mystical cornucopia had their own hierarchy. The plants that were located closer to the Icefire Yin Yang Well were either highly resistant to intense chill or intense heat, or they were extremely compatible with these temperatures. That also meant the plants closer to the lake were stronger than the others. The Delicate Silk Immortal and the Blazing Delicate Apricot grew by the lakeshore, and there was no doubt that these two flowers were some of the strongest entities in this place.</span></p>

However, the Blazing Delicate Apricot before him was undoubtedly the dominant one among all the fire-type plants, as she took up the central spot on the Blazing Sunspring’s shore.&nbsp;</span></p>
