 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao explained, “The Sun Moon Empire must have drafted plenty of new soldiers after invading two-thirds of the Heavenly Soul Empire’s land. However, the fighting power of these new soldiers is ultimately limited. They will only send their strongest troops to the front line. Hence, this means that the defence of the Sun Moon Empire will be relatively weak. If we can dispatch an elite squad to strike the Sun Moon Empire from their backs, or even perform sabotage operations in Radiant City, the battle at the front lines would become a lot less intense. In fact, there’s even a chance that the battle could dissolve.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After all, the original three nations of the Douluo Continent have plenty of resources. If we were to fight a protracted war, there is no reason for us to fear the Sun Moon Empire. And if the Sun Moon Empire were to continue to attack, they would only sink deeper into the regions within the original three nations. Their line of battle would only extend, rendering it impossible for them to return to protect their homeland.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan frowned. “Your strategy sounds pretty good. However, it is near impossible for us to dispatch an elite squad to the interior of the Sun Moon Empire. The Sun Moon Empire has enough resources dedicated to surveillance of both the land and sea routes which lead to their land. They would naturally be able to react the moment they detect our troops. I can’t think of how we—the Heavenly Soul Empire, the Star Luo Empire, and the Dou Ling Empire—can transport our troops to the interior of the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gave a sly smile as he replied, “It would naturally be impossible for the original three Empires. All of their troops have been accounted for by the Sun Moon Empire. Besides, their fighting power is far from sufficient. This elite squad must not only possess immense destructive capabilities and must be extremely flexible and agile, but they must also be able to land their blow with a single attempt, and successfully flee on command. If not, the effect of this strategy would be very limited.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan replied, “It seems like you already have someone in mind, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded. At this juncture, there was no longer any need for him to withhold the information. “Yes. I am referring to the three soul engineer legions which our Academy has painstakingly trained.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had taken close to a year to assemble the equipment for these three soul engineer legions by tapping into the wealth and support of Shrek City and the three Empires since Xuan Ziwen gave his suggestion. They had been undergoing intensive training as they learned how to better utilize their equipment and gear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xuan Ziwen, Huo Yuhao and the higher-ups in the Shrek Academy knew well enough that the capabilities of the three soul engineer legions were still not on par with the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legions. The three soul engineer legions’ abilities were all too singular. Out of the three legions, only one of them possessed airborne capabilities. Even though the other two had their own individual special abilities, their collective fighting power was still a long way from the Sun Moon Empire’s legions. Their flaws were all too apparent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, they were the products of the blood and sweat that Shrek Academy had shed for the past two years. When Huo Yuhao suggested the deployment of these three soul engineer legions, Elder Xuan was taken aback. It was simply a very costly and risky investment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was hard enough to figure out how to send them over to the Sun Moon Empire. Even if they were successfully sent over there, how were they going to survive the battles that would no doubt take place?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These three soul engineer legions were formed from thousands of soul masters! They were essentially the foundation of the entire academy. If they were to all perish on this mission, Shrek Academy would suffer an unprecedented loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao naturally knew what Elder Xuan was worrying about. When he was on his way back, he had already rehearsed his plan and fine tuned the details in his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Xuan, have you forgotten that I have the spectral demiplane? I know we won’t be able to bring the thousands of soul masters in the legion into the Sun Moon Empire. However, if it’s just me alone, those surveillance soul tools would have no effect on me. They would essentially be blind. And this has already been ascertained from my repeated trips to the Sun Moon Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Huo Yuhao’s words, Elder Xuan was stunned. However, soon enough, a smile broke out on his face. His excitement translated into a powerful spiritual wave which rippled out from his body and sent Huo Yuhao staggering a few steps backwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right! Even though his spectral demiplane contains spectral creatures and has limited space, if Huo Yuhao were able to carve out a space to contain the troops, it would actually be possible to transport them to the back of the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan found his heart beating faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “It’s better if we go with fewer people for such operations. Even bringing three legions would reduce our flexibility and agility, though my spectral demiplane would more than compensate for it. We will be the most unpredictable unit ever. It would seem as though they had all been equipped with Class 9 flying-type soul tools. Even though it would take time to transport them, the amount of time required would still be very short compared to conventional transportation means. As long as the three Empires are able to delay the Sun Moon Empire’s army, I am confident that we can wreak havoc in the interior of the Sun Moon Empire. In fact, there’s a good chance that we can threaten Radiant City. If that happens, we would have achieved something spectacular.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing what Huo Yuhao had said, Elder Xuan took a deep breath before speaking with conviction. “Let’s get everyone in the Sea God’s Pavilion together for a conference to discuss this. We must only succeed, and not fail. Yuhao, you must shoulder the responsibility for this operation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because the plan was suggested by Huo Yuhao, he accepted command without any complaints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An hour later, everyone, including Bei Bei and Zhang Lexuan, gathered together and started the conference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao explained what he had shared with Elder Xuan to the rest who were not present earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his daring tactics, all the Elders within the Sea God’s Pavilion could not believe their ears. In fact, some of the Elders did not even know that Huo Yuhao possessed the spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, how will you ensure that the spectral creatures in your spectral demiplane will not attack our people? Will your restrictive measure be guaranteed to work even when you’re not around? You must understand that you will have to fly on the outside when you are transporting the spectral demiplane to the Sun Moon Empire. If anything happens inside the demiplane when you are outside, it might just turn out to be the biggest joke ever.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “Can I invite all the Elders to enter my spectral demiplane? I believe it will be easier to show you what it actually is instead of trying to explain with words.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Elders had all understood how the spectral demiplane would be the key to turning the tables. If they were not able to see it with their own eyes, how would they be comfortable with his plan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Huo Yuhao chanted some incantations, the pitch black doors opened, and Huo Yuhao led the Elders into his spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky within the spectral demiplane was dark and grey. After entering, they felt a suffocating atmosphere. This pressure was exceptionally obvious to the living.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dark breeze blew across the land as a couple of skeleton soldiers strolled around aimlessly in the distance. After detecting the presence of living creatures, they looked up and started to move towards the group of people from the Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A golden light flickered in Huo Yuhao’s eyes, and immediately, those skeleton soldiers looked down again and fled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who had entered the demiplane before were not surprised by what lay before their eyes. However, those who were entering for the first time were particularly surprised by the absence of life in this grey plot of land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a parallel space which was completely outside of the Douluo Continent! In their eyes, everything which existed within this space was unheard of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the golden light faded from Huo Yuhao’s eyes, he gave a cold stare as an ice-blue light formed behind him. Following which, a tall, burly fellow appeared behind him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandpa.” After seeing Huo Yuhao, he greeted him enthusiastically. He was none other than Little Bai—the Ice Bear King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only a few people in the Shrek Academy knew Huo Yuhao’s true strength. When the rest saw him release the Ice Bear King, many of them silently gasped in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were all powerful individuals within Shrek Academy, and were definitely more than capable of understanding what that meant for Huo Yuhao’s abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because the Elders had all attained the rank of Titled Douluo, they could no longer possess spirits. However, this did not interfere with their interest and research into spirits. Conversely, their interest in spirits was a lot stronger than younger people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was apparent that the fatty that Huo Yuhao had just released was one of his spirits. Huo Yuhao was the only soul master known to have multiple spirits.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fact that the spirit was able to take on a human form and solidify meant that the fatty was a beast with at least ten thousand years of cultivation before becoming Huo Yuhao’s spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, most of the people seemed to have ignored how it addressed Huo Yuhao as his grandfather.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded at Little Bai as he instructed, “Get yourself to come out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright!’ Little Bai agreed as he turned around and released a deafening howl across the expansive plains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though this howl was not particularly bright, it was very special. As the sound wave travelled outwards, there were signs of ripples moving across the air. Strangely enough, the ripples did not seem to affect those who were present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It must have cultivated for more than ten thousand years!</span></p>
