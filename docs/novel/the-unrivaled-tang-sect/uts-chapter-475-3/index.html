 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The low temperature didn’t have any effect on either of them. After reaching an altitude of four thousand meters, Little Bai started to slow down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao watched what was happening below. He could only see glimpses of light from the Sun Moon Empire’s base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Bai, it’s about time. Right here,” Huo Yuhao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Little Bai acknowledged his words, and slowed further. He was able to rise with the Tai Tan Snowdevil King in the Extreme North, and the Snow Empress had no choice but to bring him away to protect the Tai Tan Snowdevil King’s rule. The fact alone showed how strong he was. It was just that the Snow Empress’ presence made him seem very harmless. If someone actually took him as an easy target to bully, he would be sure to punish that person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Little Bai, it’s up to you now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No problem! Let me show you how good I am!” Little Bai shouted in delight. He and the Tai Tan Snowdevil King seemed to have some kind of dislike for each other. In the past, they would always fight every time they saw one another. Even though he couldn’t fight the Tai Tan Snowdevil King this time because of the Snow Empress, that competitive mindset hadn’t disappeared. This time, the Tai Tan Snowdevil King was on the ground, while he was in the air. He was delighted. He even thought that Huo Yuhao was more on his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, Huo Yuhao had brought him into the air because he was more adept at controlling the elements, whereas the Tai Tan Snowdevil King was physically stronger, and more suited for direct assaults. Those were the only reasons…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hoo hoo!” Low-pitched whimpers started to resonate from Little Bai’s mouth. His thick and chubby arms extended out to either side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dim-blue light started to emanate from him, and he started to balloon in size. He was returning to his original form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to demonstrate his full abilities in front of Huo Yuhao. To do so, it was best if he was in his original form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King glowed with an icy-blue halo in the night sky. He was almost thirty meters tall, his body like a small mountain, but he still managed to remain adrift in mid-air. His eyes, which were extremely small earlier, started to expand along with his body. His pupils emanated a dark-blue light. This light flowed out from his eyes as if it was liquid. His immense soul power undulations started to slowly but steadily spread out. They were even viscous as they seeped from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he was above Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao could only sense the terrifying soul power undulations that the Ice Bear King released.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps he wasn’t as steady, firm, and powerful as Di Tian, but the soul power undulations that he released right now were definitely much stronger than those of Transcendent Douluo. Furthermore, he was terrifying. He was like an impregnable moving castle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King roared. His icy-blue soul power started to revolve around his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He kept pouring out his soul power, while the ice elements in the air started to gather towards him at an alarming speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The position that Huo Yuhao was in wasn’t affected at all. He managed to observe with his Spiritual Detection that there was a ball of blue light in front of the Ice Bear King’s chest, in the form of a whirlwind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had to be a soul core, the soul core of the Ice Bear King. Compared to Huo Yuhao’s own soul core, the Ice Bear King’s soul core was much bigger. It was even located in his chest. As this huge soul core revolved, the Ice Bear King’s own soul power seemed to pour out without limit. The ice elements in the air were quickly strengthened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was astonished to see some of the clouds far away starting to drift towards them as the Ice Bear King released his soul power. They turned into countless snowflakes that danced excitedly around the Ice Bear King’s immense figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roars reverberated continuously from the Ice Bear King. Slowly, a huge whirlwind formed from ice and snow appeared in the air, spinning very quickly. The most terrifying thing was that it was expanding rapidly, too. In just a matter of seconds, the area that the Ice Bear King controlled spanned more than a thousand meters in diameter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like the Snow Empress had mentioned, all ice-type soul beasts were much stronger in the Extreme North. This was applicable to the Ice Bear King, too!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they were further south, the temperature of the air wouldn’t be so low. If he wanted to do something like this, he would need to use at least twenty percent more soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The huge whirlwind was still expanding rapidly. It went from a fifteen hundred meters to two thousand meters, to twenty-five hundred meters, and then to three thousand meters in diameter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If not for the fact that it was very dark right now, and they were forty-five hundred meters up in the sky, such a terrifying whirlwind would have immediately been discovered. It was a pity that the Sun Moon Empire’s aerial surveillance soul tools couldn’t see anything at such an altitude. An altitude of five thousand meters was threatening to all life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King’s roars slowly grew stronger and stronger. His soul power was still being released at an increasing rate. The whirlwind appeared to be boundless by now. It was maintained at a constant speed, but its diameter slowly reached four thousand, and then five thousand meters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Huo Yuhao’s first time seeing a savage beast unleashing its full abilities. It was extremely terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the Ice Bear King demonstrated such great abilities, how strong was Di Tian? If not for the fact that Elder Xuan and Elder Mu had teamed up to fight Di Tian, Shrek Academy would have been destroyed. Soul beasts were indeed the same terrifying creatures that had once ruled the Douluo Continent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King had turned completely icy-blue. His originally white fur was like ice crystals now. His dominant aura was still growing stronger and stronger. However, the size of the whirlwind stopped growing when it reached a diameter of five thousand meters. The only thing that changed was its speed. Under his control, it started to spin faster. Slowly, sharp whizzing and ear-piercing wind-blowing sounds started to resonate in the air. The sound made it seem like the air was about to be torn apart. In addition, the temperature around the whirlwind started to fall significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dancing snowflakes slowly turned into sharp ice flakes. Under the effect of the raging wind, they turned into terrifying, lethal weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King roared in excitement. He lifted his bear palms before mimicking a pressing action, his body starting to shine with icy-blue light. The whirlwind deviated from his control, and started to descend. As it descended, it started to expand again, as the Ice Bear King was no longer controlling it anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A diameter of five thousand meters was just the start. A blizzard was about to come!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the innate soul skill of the Ice Bear King, Blizzard! It was a true blizzard. His innate soul skill was only perfected with the Snow Empress’ advice. Even someone as strong as the Tai Tan Snowdevil King had to avoid the Ice Bear King’s Blizzard. The only alternative was to stop the Ice Bear King from unleashing the complete version of his Blizzard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Blizzard raged in the air. Sharp chillwinds and bone-piercing ice flakes were sweeping all through the sky. Very soon, the area that the whirlwind covered was ten times its original size. From above, Huo Yuhao could clearly see that this Blizzard had actually covered the entire base, and even most of the surveillance soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’s too strong.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had his own judgment of the Ice Bear King, he actually realized that the Ice Bear King was extremely powerful, even though he was very simple-minded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King smacked his palms against his chest and shouted excitedly. A portion of the raging ice elements in the air started to gather towards him, and he absorbed them into his body to replenish himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandpa, how is it? I’m quite good, right?” the Ice Bear King asked, delighted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Great! We’ll wait for the results now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given the Blizzard, even his Spiritual Detection was slightly ineffective. He needed time for the Ice Bear King’s terrifying soul skill to be fully unleashed before deciding whether it was effective. As for the Sun Moon Empire, he could only pray for them. The Ice Bear King’s Blizzard was simply too powerful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">--------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was completing some administrative matters in the commander’s tent when she noticed that the wind outside seemed to have gotten much stronger. The howl of the wind grew louder and louder. She even felt that the soul lamps in the tent were starting to flicker a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Are there strong winds outside?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She grabbed her coat from her seat and put it on before leaving the tent. When she first opened the curtains, she felt a gust of bone-chilling wind sweep across her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She shivered.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s so cold!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chilly winds howled by. Depressions formed on the surfaces of all the tents. In the air, snowflakes danced and descended. In addition, the winds and snowflakes were hitting the base harder and harder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why is there such a strong blizzard?</span></p>
