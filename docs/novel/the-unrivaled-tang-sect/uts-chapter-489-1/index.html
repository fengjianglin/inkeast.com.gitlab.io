 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Adjusting one’s breathing and spiritual power are things I did not teach him before! How did he manage to do it?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was puzzled as he watched Huo Yuhao. Right now, he was more and more interested in learning how his student managed to achieve such a standard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Huo Yuhao moved. He wasn’t quick. He casually grabbed a piece of rare metal and placed it in a mold. After that, he lifted a forging hammer and started to hammer the piece of rare metal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is he making the outer shell first?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen had a skeptical look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a soul engineer, the core formation should always be produced first when making a soul tool. This was because creating the outer shell of even an advanced-tier soul tool wasn’t very difficult. The real difficulty lay in the core formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao wanted to manufacture the outer shell first. What was he doing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, he had thought too highly of Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao only chose to make the outer shell first for one reason. He was too raw!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had not seriously manufactured a soul tool for a long time! The last time he did so was during the tournament in Radiant City. Even though he had managed to understand the blueprint over the past two days, what if he made a mistake while starting with the core formation? He had to practice first and get used to the feeling of making a soul tool, so this was what he did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A slight error when making the outer shell could be rectified. However, the core formation would become useless with even the slightest problem. He would then have to start over again, which was a waste of resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t want that to happen. This was why he started with the outer shell first to get back into the feeling of making soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ding, ding, ding…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A series of clear sounds echoed out. At the start, Huo Yuhao was still rather slow. However, he gradually picked up speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was because the rare metal in front of him was very clear. Every minor detail on it was under his perusal. Under such circumstances, he didn’t need to think too much. In addition, he felt that he was simply too slow, given how strong his spiritual power was, so he naturally picked up speed. In others’ eyes, he actually looked pretty quick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he forged the metal, it sounded like raindrops were drumming rhythmically against banana leaves. Not only was it pleasant, but Huo Yuhao’s movements were also very delightful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen nodded repeatedly as he watched Huo Yuhao’s movements. There were generally two ways to make the outer shell of a soul tool. In one, the metal could be directly punched after creating a mold. This would allow the metal to take shape in one go. This was more applicable for larger-scale soul tools. The second way was to use Huo Yuhao’s current method of forging the metal himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was comparatively easy to forge the metal on the carving table, since there were all sorts of equipment he could turn to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao was so quick that Xuan Ziwen couldn’t achieve the same standard if he were in his place. What this required was stability and accuracy. At the same time, one’s observations had to be quick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The inner parts of a piece of rare metal weren’t completely stable. This was applicable across all rare metals. Any changes to a rare metal had to be carefully observed while it was being forged, even if it was only for an outer shell. This allowed for the most effective use of rare metals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Huo Yuhao was quick, he was accurate. Under his control, the lines on the metal were forged very neatly. From this, it was clear how sturdy his basic foundation was. Xuan Ziwen was originally very displeased with how lackluster Huo Yuhao was performing during this period of time, but this displeasure slowly faded away. No matter what, Huo Yuhao was a student that he had nurtured!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very quickly, the first piece of the outer shell was created. It was time for the second piece.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the first piece as experience, Huo Yuhao quickly adapted, and found it much easier with the second piece of the outer shell. Furthermore, the soul power undulations that he released from his body soon disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Oh? This kid is using his own strength to forge the metal? Won’t his muscles be sore?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sore? Huo Yuhao felt as if he had the strength of a ten-thousand-year soul beast, even if he didn’t use his soul power. Ever since he had fused with Wang Qiu’er, his strength had grown significantly. More recently, he had even absorbed Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence and a Dragon Pill. With these two treasures, he felt like a human savage beast. When he fully absorbed all the medicinal power of the Dragon Pill, he would truly become a human Savage Beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although rare metals were tough, he was already as strong as a Titled Douluo. This was nothing to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, Xuan Ziwen discovered that his worries were unfounded. Piece after piece of the outer shell was created by Huo Yuhao. Furthermore, he was also getting faster and faster. Giving up the use of his soul power had no effect on him at all. Occasionally, he even lifted his head to laugh. Even still, the forging hammer still landed very accurately on the rare metals before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A genius is a genius!,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen raved inside. From watching Huo Yuhao, he fully understood how a spiritual-type soul master always had an edge over ordinary soul masters with regards to creating and researching soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao only took an hour to create the outer shell of a Class 8 decomposition cannon, which required more than forty external accessories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every part of the outer shell presented a beautiful streamlined design. Even with Xuan Ziwen’s strict standards, there were no flaws at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After completing the outer shell, Huo Yuhao moved slightly, and started to move the pieces of the soul tool on the carving table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew that he was about to start on the core formation, which was the most important part of a soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was obvious how complex the core formation of a Class 8 soul tool was. Moreover, this was Huo Yuhao’s first attempt at a Class 8 soul tool! Even Xuan Ziwen wasn’t confident about his chances, so everyone around also didn’t think that he would succeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao was very composed right now. His expression was very calm, and there was even a confident smile on his face. This baffled those watching. They knew Huo Yuhao very well, and knew that he was great at creating miracles. This was the reason why they were willing to wait here and witness the birth of a miracle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen only stood there quietly and watched. He wasn’t rushing Huo Yuhao, only waiting for him to do his stuff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao retrieved a piece of rare metal and focused. At the same time, he lifted his right hand and made a grabbing gesture toward that piece of rare metal. His eyes also turned a dim gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His gentle spiritual power was like a lady’s hand, landing gently on that piece of rare metal. To others, Huo Yuhao was only unleashing his spiritual power. However, Huo Yuhao could clearly sense that the piece of rare metal started to show closely-woven lines. These lines were the blueprint that he had memorized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he had long since memorized the blueprint, he still carefully projected it on the rare metal using his spiritual power to ensure that things went smoothly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t use the carving knife on the table. Each of the fingertips of his right hand now had dark gold blades at the end of them. Weren’t those his Darkgolden Terrorclaws?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he didn’t fully unleash his Darkgolden Terrorclaws, only revealing an inch of them. In this way, he could achieve the same effects as using a carving knife. His Darkgolden Terrorclaws could compare to most of the carving knives on the carving knife leaderboard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t that Huo Yuhao didn’t want to use his Life Guardian Blade, but it had grown too large. It was no longer in the shape of a carving knife. It wouldn’t be very smooth using it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His five fingers gently tapped the rare metal before his wrist started moving. Suddenly, everyone saw a dark-golden light flash before five slivers of rare metal slipped off the original piece.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Carving using five blades simultaneously?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou opened his eyes wide. Even Xuan Ziwen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s five fingers started to move gently and rhythmically. It was like he was gently caressing the rare metal. Slivers continued to fall from the piece he was working on. The outer layer was soon being carved out. Huo Yuhao’s actions weren’t quick, but He Caitou and Xuan Ziwen both knew that his carving method was much faster than the traditional method of carving a core formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The general shape of the core formation was soon carved out.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s actions were shocking, but pleasing. However, he realized that Huo Yuhao’s actions weren’t that magical. During this carving process, Huo Yuhao had only carved the outer shape of the core formation. He hadn’t touched the most delicate part of it yet, only simplified the carving process of the outside. The true essence of the core formation would depend on how well he did later on. Furthermore, this was only one of the twenty-four core formations required.</span></p>

This required all twenty-four formations to be completely flawless throughout the entire process. During the combination of these formations, immense soul and spiritual power was needed as support before the entire process could be completed!</span></p>
