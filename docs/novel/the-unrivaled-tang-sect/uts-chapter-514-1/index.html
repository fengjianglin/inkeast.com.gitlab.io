<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao discovered a mysterious glistening layer on top of the soul power in his Mysterious Heaven Technique. That glistening layer felt very mystical, as though it was a blend of white and black which merged with his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his cultivation increased, Huo Yuhao’s soul power had transformed into a faint golden color. This was a product of the continual improvement of his abilities. While his soul power remained golden, there was now an additional membrane-like exterior on the outside of his soul power. This light membrane was formed from the black and white colors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this additional membrane, Huo Yuhao suddenly discovered a leap in the quality of his soul power. It had become a lot more refined, and seemed to be pulsating. The rhythm at which his soul power was pulsating appeared to be directly linked to the movement or activity of his soul. It was almost as if his spiritual energy and soul power had fused together. In other words, they were no longer distinct compounds, but the same kind of energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he took a glance at Tang Wutong, Huo Yuhao realized that the soul power that Tang Wutong had integrated into the Haodong Power had also transformed. Her soul power, which was originally golden, now had an additional violet tinge on its exterior. Huo Yuhao recognized this violet color! Back then when he first tried and failed to integrate with her martial soul, Tang Wutong’s soul power had been exactly like this. He could still remember the grandeur it exuded very clearly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, when they were trying to fuse their martial souls above the Sea God’s Lake, Tang Wutong seemed to have called something back from the golden trident rune on her forehead. Now it was apparent that the strange thing she had called back was probably this violet membrane. And because Huo Yuhao had gained the black and white light membrane and Tang Wutong had regained her violet membrane, both their soul powers had a fundamental transformation. However, the fusion of their martial souls was still seamless. Their Haodong Power was also undergoing a similar fundamental transformation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unless everything I experienced was real?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was in disbelief, but he knew that was the only possible answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If that was the case, the additional membrane on his soul power could be explained. He would also know what had been added to his soul power. The black and white membrane must be the divine sense the God of Emotions was referring to.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If my martial soul is still able to fuse with Tang Wutong’s martial soul under such circumstances, does that mean Tang Wutong’s soul power also possesses divine sense? After all, her soul power also has a membrane… That would explain why I was unable to fuse with her martial soul! It was because she had divine sense, and her soul power was at a higher level than mine!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After thinking it through, Huo Yuhao’s mind cleared up. Even though he didn’t not know where and how Tang Wutong got her divine sense, he knew it would surely not be a bad thing! In fact, things could not be better! Their original Haodong Power was about 1.5 times their total soul power. But with the foundation of their respective divine sense, their Haodong Power gained another 50% from their condensed soul power. This meant that when they performed a fusion of their martial souls, their soul power alone would allow them to be on par with a Rank 92 Titled Douluo! Of course, their soul power regeneration ability would still be incomparable to a Titled Douluo’s, because they didn’t possess the same soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But their martial souls were undeniably amongst the best martial souls out there! Besides, stamina was not the sole success factor in battles. When it came to explosiveness, Huo Yuhao was very confident in his abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The God of Emotions. A Godly Seat. Have I really been chosen by a God?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The return of his loved one and the gift of a Godly Seat had seemed to turn his life around. Everything started to seem wonderful, as though he had finally reached the light at the end of the tunnel. This made the love in Huo Yuhao’s heart even stronger as the circulation of the Haodong Power became even smoother and more perfect. As Huo Yuhao steadied the thoughts in his mind and started to focus on the circulations, he continued cultivating with Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden trident rune on Tang Wutong’s forehead was glowing gently as the violet glow circulated around it and entered her body. Compared to Huo Yuhao, she had already emptied her mind, and was fully focused on cultivation. Basking in Huo Yuhao’s love, she was in undeniable bliss and comfort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was also undergoing a mysterious transformation. A large part of the transformation was the fusion of her memories of the past. Those cloudy memories were fusing and integrating with her mind under the influence of Huo Yuhao’s love. She was regaining everything, from her memories to her emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? They’re still not out yet?” Xu Sanshi exclaimed with a strange expression on his face as he looked at Bei Bei. “It’s already been so many days. Even newlyweds don’t over-exert themselves to this extent, right? It’s already been seven days since they sparred with Dean Yan and returned to the Sea God’s Pavilion. I must say, they’re really…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">strong</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei frowned and replied, "Enough of that. Can you not use your dirty mind to measure the actions and thoughts of our little junior brother? They are not doing any of the "over-exertions" you have in your dirty mind. I heard from Elder Xuan that both of them have been busy cultivating. And it appears that both of them have made significant progress. They have entered a state of deep meditation, and may even be in the Conscious State of Deep Meditation. After all, if we were to compare our talents, Tang Wutong and little junior brother probably have the most out of the seven of us."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi gave an awkward smile and replied, "To be honest, I must say I wasn't very accepting of the fact that he was more talented than us in the past. But since he returned the other time, I must say I can't help but agree with what you just said. Argh! There's no point comparing with one another. We really need to work harder. Wait, isn't little junior brother helping us concoct elixirs? I wonder how much they’ll help us improve our abilities this time around…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei hissed, "Can you stop thinking about such things? Growth and improvement brought by external products will never truly belong to our bodies. Nothing beats improvement gained by our own training."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi giggled, "Oh come on! I'm sure you share the same thoughts as me! We are very different from the usual soul engineers. Because we have been training hard from our youth, our foundation is extremely firm and secured. Besides, little junior brother only uses rare and precious herbs for his elixirs. They have hardly any side-effects or drawbacks. Oh, that's right, how is Xiao Ya been doing these few days?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Xu Sanshi mention Xiao Ya, Bei Bei's eyes softened visibly. "She’s in much better shape now, even though her body is still a little weak. It also appears that she has started to regain some of her memories. She is so lucky to have little junior brother's Life Guardian Blade by her side. Even though her life energy continues to leak away, she should be fine for the next two or three years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi nodded and said, “I’ve been keeping tabs on the different auctions. We have already dispatched the tasks, and we have started to see people returning with different medicines. Even though we have yet to see the real Bluesilver Emperor, things have started to look really positive as more powerful individuals join us in this task. I believe that with the additional manpower, we will be able to deliver the Bluesilver Emperor in no time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded gently and said, “I really hope so. We have already troubled so many people to help Xiao Ya.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi rolled his eyes and said, “Oh come on! We’re a family. Xiao Ya is both the Sect Leader of the Tang Sect and also my sister-in-law. How can we not help her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei smiled, “Alright, alright. You should run along and train those young people now. All three of our Soul Engineer Legions’ combat powers have all been established. You should go and help them out. Little junior brother was right. The right way to go in the future is to integrate the power of soul masters and soul tools. We might have neglected soul tools all this while, but the Sun Moon Empire has been over-reliant on them. Their troops might perform well in groups, but when it comes to individual unit strength, our newly trained soul engineers will most definitely be stronger than them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi nodded and replied, “I really hope we can make up for the gap between the Sun Moon Empire’s soul tools and ours. Alright, that’s enough for now. I shall take my leave.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he finished his sentence, Xu Sanshi turned and left, while Bei Bei started to settle some of the work that needed to be done.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire's royal palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dressed in a long, elegant white dress, Ju Zi sat in the courtyard quietly as she basked lazily under the warm, inviting sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a fur scarf draped across her shoulders. Blush had been applied to her pretty face, which threatened to steal the limelight of anything and everything in her presence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was also some pelt draped across her thighs. She gently stroked her abdomen with her right hand as her eyes radiated warmth and affection. She seemed to be lost in her thoughts from time to time, as though she had recalled something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roarrr! The low belting sound of a dragon echoed across the sky. The dense ripples of its soul power fused with its strong spiritual energy and rippled outwards slowly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gigantic Golden Tree glowed as though it were absorbing this enormous amount of energy, which was dissipating through the air. It also seemed like it was trying to prevent any wasteful leakage of these precious energy waves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dragon’s roar was neither created by a man nor a dragon. It originated from a golden spiral. And this golden spiral was precisely the one between Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their palms were raised against one another, and the golden spiral was circulating and spiralling perfectly between them.&nbsp;</span></p>
