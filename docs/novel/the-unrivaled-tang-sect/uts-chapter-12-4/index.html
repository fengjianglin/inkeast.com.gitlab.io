 <p><strong>Book 2: Academy of Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 12.4: Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan</strong></p>
 <p>Bei Bei simply smiled. “What if you lose?”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi snorted and said, “I’ll give you one thousand gold soul coins.”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei shook his head before saying, “That won’t do. I know that the Mysterious Water Pill isn’t worth only a thousand gold soul coins. I won’t make an unfair bet with you.”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi angrily retorted, “I only have that much money. If you don’t agree, I’m going to get very angry.”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei sighed softly and said, “Do I look like I lack money? Fine, I’ll give you a chance. I know you still have more Mysterious Water Pills. Take another one out and use it as the wager.”</p>
 <p>A trace of suspicion appeared in Xu Sanshi’s eyes. “Why do I feel like I’ve fallen into your trap? It seems like you’re sure that you can beat me.”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei still kept a warm smile on his face. “You’re the person who wanted to make a bet, not me. You can still choose not to bet. Also, don’t moan and groan when you lose to me later on.”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi snorted and said, “Me, lose? Although I can’t guarantee that I can beat you, it won’t be easy for you to beat me either. If we were to tie, how would our bet work?”</p>
 <p>However, Bei Bei wasn’t fooled by him. “Then we’ll each keep what we already have. Hurry up, stop acting like a sissy.”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi clenched his teeth and said, “Fine, I’ll bet with you. You bastard. You might not be stronger than me, but you’re extremely crafty. I reckon that I’ve been tricked by you again. If worst comes to worst, I’ll just go suck up to my dad when I get back.”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei’s still had a smile on his face. Although Xu Sanshi was trying his best to look for a change in his expression, he wasn’t able to notice anything.</p>
 <p>“You! You’re not really stupid, but you’ll immediately turn foolish towards any matter that Jiang Nannan’s involved in. I really don’t know whether you two were some sort of enemies in your previous life. Even though Jiang Nannan is pretty, there are many excellent female students in Shrek Academy. Why do you insist on giving your unrequited love to a flower?”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi unhappily said, “Don’t be an armchair expert. If you’re so against with it, why don’t you give Tang Ya to me?”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei stood up and retorted, “You’d better quickly adjust your body’s condition so that you won’t be unconvinced when you lose later. I’ll go first.” He’d already started to walk out as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Tang Ya’s predictions were spot on. The number of students that had gathered in the Soul Dueling Area had gradually increased, and currently it exceeded four hundred. It wouldn’t be a problem at all to gather five hundred students by the time the duel started.</p>
 <p>“Huo Yuhao.” A voice that was fuming with anger caused Huo Yuhao to be startled. When he turned around to see who it was, he saw the tidily dressed Wang Dong aggressively walking towards him.</p>
 <p>“Why did you come?” Huo Yuhao asked with a somewhat guilty tone. When he saw Wang Dong, he immediately recalled that white scene...</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s face had both shades of red and white on it. He sat down next to Huo Yuhao and spoke with a low voice, “Tell me, what did you see?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was stunned for a moment. Then he replied, “Ah? I didn’t see anything!”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong snorted angrily. “If you don’t knock next time, I’ll kill you.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao knew that he was in the wrong, but he still muttered to himself, “We’re all men...it’s not like you’d suffer a loss if I saw anything.”</p>
 <p>“What did you just say?” Wang Dong flew into a rage and raised his hand to grab Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>A slender palm stretched over and slapped Wang Dong’s hand away. Afterwards, Tang Ya’s voice rang out, “Little Yuhao, you haven’t introduced him to me.”</p>
 <p>Only then did Wang Dong notice Tang Ya’s existence. When he saw Tang Ya’s exceedingly beautiful face, he was slightly stunned. However, he quickly regained his composure and snorted, before choosing to ignore Huo Yuhao. At first, after Huo Yuhao had run off, Wang Dong had quickly put his clothes on. However, he hadn’t been able to find any traces of Huo Yuhao’s existence. He’d wanted to meditate, but wasn’t able to calm himself down at all. At that exact moment, he heard the announcement that was broadcast to the dorms. Thus, he decided to go out and relieve some of his boredom. However, he didn’t think that he’d bump into Huo Yuhao and Tang Ya here.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao quickly said, “Teacher Xiao Ya, this is my roommate Wang Dong. Wang Dong, this is Tang Ya, one of our senior classmates.” He was only able to give a simple introduction such as this.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong nodded towards Tang Ya, who smiled and said, “What a pretty young boy! I like him! Little Yuhao, how about you persuade him to join our Tang Sect?”</p>
 <p>When Wang Dong heard the two words ‘Tang Sect’, his body trembled slightly. Astonished, he said, “Both of you are from the Tang Sect?”</p>
 <p>Tang Ya nodded her head a few times and said, “Yeah, there’s only three of us left in the Tang Sect. I’m the current sect master of the Tang Sect. How about it, are you astonished? Come, come, the Tang Sect welcomes you.”</p>
 <p>Even though Tang Ya was usually a very carefree person, and although she was just casually saying this without thinking the matter through, anyone who thought she was dim-witted would eventually suffer a huge loss under her hand. She’d already seen how unordinary Wang Dong was. His essence was hidden, and his soul force had been condensed. With just a glance you could tell that his cultivation far surpassed Huo Yuhao’s.</p>
 <p>However, Tang Ya was surprised when Wang Dong actually nodded at her proposal after a short period of blankness. He quickly said, “Sure! I’ve already heard about the miraculousness of the Tang Sect’s hidden weapons. Sect master Tang, I wish to join the Tang Sect. Please accept me.”</p>
 <p>“Ah? You really want to join the Tang Sect? But our Tang Sect only has three people left.” Tang Ya was extremely shocked. She looked at Wang Dong with a puzzled look.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong nodded seriously and said, “I wish to join the Tang Sect and learn how to use hidden weapons.”</p>
 <p>Tang Ya’s expression also turned solemn as she said, “I’ll have to think this matter over. I’ll let Huo Yuhao give you my answer later.”</p>
 <p>During the short moment of time that they’d been talking, Bei Bei had walked into the arena from the lounge. Some of the students sitting near the arena had already started to shout out his name as he appeared.</p>
 <p>“Thunderbolt Bei Bei, Thunderbolt Bei Bei…”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei smiled towards the spectating students and waved at them, but his gaze was searching through the viewing platform.</p>
 <p>Only when Tang Ya stood up and waved at him did Bei Bei see where they were. Because they were separated by a great distance, the trio probably wouldn’t hear anything if he spoke. Thus, he just gestured a few times at Tang Ya.</p>
 <p>The two had been together for quite a while already, so Tang Ya immediately returned a few gestures to show that she understood what he meant, before sitting back down.</p>
 <p>“Little Yuhao, what’s the maximum range of your Spiritual Detection Sharing?” Tang Ya whispered into Huo Yuhao’s ear.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao answered, “If it’s only in one direction, about fifty metres or so.”</p>
 <p>Earlier, he’d tested the limit of his Spiritual Detection when it was used in a single direction with Wang Dong. If he released it normally, it had a diameter of thirty metres. This meant that it only a fifteen metre radius. On the other hand, fifty metres was already more than twice his limit. However, it consumed a large amount of Huo Yuhao’s soul force when he directed it like that.</p>
 <p>Tang Ya immediately raised her right hand and made a few hand gestures towards Bei Bei, who nodded back at her.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Xu Sanshi also walked into the Soul Dueling Arena. There was a forty-or-so year-old teacher who followed him out.</p>
 <p>When they reached the Soul Dueling Arena, Xu Sanshi and Bei Bei both had a cold look of concentration on their faces. This wasn’t their first time competing against each other in the Soul Dueling Arena. In the past, they’d both achieved victories over one another, but most of their duels had ended in ties. They’d truly managed to earn a lot of money from this Soul Dueling Competition, thus they naturally couldn’t reveal the fact that they were close friends.</p>
 <p>The teacher that was acting as the referee walked to the centre of the arena, then said in a low voice, “Fourth year student ‘Bei Bei’ is challenging fifth year student ‘Xu Sanshi’. If Xu Sanshi loses this match, he will have to pay an additional ten gold soul coins to Bei Bei. You’ve already made your bets in private. Are you two ready?”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi both simultaneously nodded.</p>
