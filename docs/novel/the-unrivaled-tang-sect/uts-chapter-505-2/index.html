 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the sky outside, it was already dark. Huo Yuhao quickly dressed in the new clothes that Bei Bei had given him. They fit well. He was wearing a white warrior robe, which only had a few accessories. However, many parts of the robe were made from silk. Even though the robe was white, it refracted light to differing degrees, and made Huo Yuhao look very elegant in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao also felt more energized and refreshed as he donned the robe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Huo Yuhao felt his first sense of excitement after fusing with Little Bai as his fifth Spirit. This excitement didn’t come from his Spirit, but from the fact that he was now an eight-ringed Soul Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Soul Douluo was only inferior to Titled Douluo! Huo Yuhao was barely twenty years old. No one in the history of Shrek Academy was able to achieve what he had at this age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan became a Soul Douluo when she was thirty, and she was already the pride of Shrek Academy back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shuddered when he thought of her. He didn’t dare to delay any further. He didn’t even bother with eating, and quickly rushed towards Shrek Academy. If he was late, she might be infuriated with him. He couldn’t afford to offend her, he still had to graduate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao rushed all the way to Shrek Academy. School had already ended, and the students were all streaming out. The gates of the Academy were far more crowded than they were when he had entered for his first time, so long ago. Due to the expansion of Shrek City, the entire Academy was now a busy area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took some effort to squeeze through the gates. Just as he was prepared to enter the Academy, he heard some students discussing something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard there’ll be a Sea God’s Fated Blind Date in the inner courtyard tonight, on the Sea God’s Lake. Furthermore, this year’s Fated Blind Date is different from previous years. Even those not from the inner courtyard are allowed to observe the event. This is unprecedented, but I’m not sure what the reason for it is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sure you don’t. My cousin is from the inner courtyard. This time, the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date is open to outer courtyard disciples because it’s being used as a way to stimulate us to work harder. It’s only by working hard and becoming an inner courtyard disciple that we can participate in a Sea God’s Fated Blind Date. It’s important to know that our seniors who take part in the Blind Dates are extremely talented. It would be great to have such a partner. Furthermore, I’ve heard that the success rate is high. A lot of seniors were unwilling to reveal their feelings when they were still in the outer courtyard. They can take this chance to reveal them all. Of course, I’ve also heard that it’s important for one to be strong enough if they want to achieve anything in the Blind Date.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, we need to work hard! I’m going to work hard. One day, I must stand on the Sea God’s Lake and participate in the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date! Let’s go and get something to eat quick. We’ll rush back after we finish eating and get a good spot. Otherwise, we won’t be able to see anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, you don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m prepared to buy a magnifying soul tool. With that thing, I can even see the sleeves of our seniors clearly. In addition, it’s not that expensive, either. The Tang Sect has just released a new batch of them. Do you want one?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? There’s something as good as that? Of course I want it. I can still use it to peep at girls in the future…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he listened up to that point, Huo Yuhao became nostalgic.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I really didn’t expect outer courtyard students to be allowed to observe the Fated Blind Date. It seems those two juniors are right. Permitting them to observe the event can help stimulate their cultivation. This isn’t really a bad thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It feels so much better than when I just joined the Academy! How great would it be if I could watch the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date with Dong’er?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he thought of Wang Dong’er, Huo Yuhao felt a bit of heartache, and gently shook his head. He quickened his pace as he headed towards the inner Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Academy was very crowded. Huo Yuhao put his student badge on his chest, so no one stopped him. However, he knew fewer of the students now that a few batches had graduated. At most, a few students thought that he was dressed rather weirdly, because almost all the students took pride in wearing the uniform of the Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao made his way to the shore of Sea God’s Lake, he was stunned to realize that the sky was still bright. It was barely evening, but there were already people seated at the better spots. He came to a spot on the shore that was close to the lake itself, and saw a young outer courtyard student just settling down. There was a mat that could seat more than ten people on the ground. He seemed to have just finished setting it up, and the edges of the mat were pressed down with various items. After he finished, he tidied up the mat as he sat down in satisfaction on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Junior, why are you taking up so much space?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outer courtyard student didn’t even lift his head and replied, “Who says that I’m alone? I’m here to reserve seats for others. There’s more than ten of us. They went to get some food, and will be back soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed, “All of you have indeed allocated your duties well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That student laughed in return, “Yes! If we don’t come early, we won’t have good spots. We’re already so tired from cultivating every day. This is a good opportunity to relax. All of us treasure this opportunity. It’s excellent to be able to witness how our seniors are going to seek love. We came here to set our own targets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “It’s good that you’re not here just to skive. However, it’s also good to take a breather every now and then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” This outer courtyard student felt something amiss when he heard how Huo Yuhao was advising him. He lifted his head and looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s robe caught a lot of attention. After that, he saw the badge on Huo Yuhao’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The badge given to the inner courtyard disciples was red. There was also an image of a Shrek Monster on it. It was extremely obvious on Huo Yuhao’s white robe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah! A senior from the inner courtyard. Are you a senior from the inner courtyard?” The outer courtyard student was immediately impressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The inner courtyard disciples in Shrek Academy were highly respected. They were even more respected than some teachers in the outer courtyard. After all, inner courtyard disciples all had at least five soul rings. The more outstanding ones even had seven rings. If this was the outer courtyard, they would already be a Dean. Furthermore, they were all young, and extremely talented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outer courtyard students were already talented, and the inner courtyard students were even more so. Normally, inner courtyard students rarely interacted with outer courtyard students, as they were very busy with their cultivation. So this outer courtyard student was very excited when he met an inner courtyard disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and replied, “Yes! Nice to meet you, junior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outer courtyard student jumped up excitedly. “Senior, I’m called Jin Sha. My friends call me Sandbag. You can call me that, too! Are you going to Sea God’s Island?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outer courtyard student was shaking with excitement as he asked, “Will you be going to the Sea God Pavilion’s Blind Date tonight?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled. “It’s the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date. You’ve said something wrong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Er, er… I’m too excited. I was at a loss for words.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “I’ll be there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow, that’s great! Senior, I envy you so much! I wonder when I can participate?!” Jin Sha said excitedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao saw his uniform; he was a Year 3 or 4 student. From his soul power undulations, it seemed like he had three rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ll get your chance if you work hard. Let’s work hard together, junior. I’ll go and register first. If we’re fated to meet again, we’ll meet each other again.” As he spoke, Huo Yuhao waved his hand before he flew up and towards the Sea God’s Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bye, senior!” Jin Sha waved back at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Huo Yuhao was already more than ten meters away. He touched the surface of the lake with his toes as he proceeded towards the Sea God’s Paviliom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To Huo Yuhao, this was very easy. However, Jin Sha was filled with admiration and envy. As he watched Huo Yuhao slowly disappear into the distance, he couldn’t help but mutter to himself, “When can I as be as strong as this senior? He can fly over water without even unleashing his martial soul. He’s really powerful! He has to be at least a Soul Emperor!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao naturally didn’t know that Jin Sha was evaluating how strong he was. Very soon, he reached Sea God’s Island. After reaching the island, he naturally went straight to the Sea God’s Pavilion. He didn’t know where to register for the Blind Date.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sea God’s Pavilion was as calm and quiet as ever. The refreshing and fragrant air gave one an invigorating feeling. It was indescribably comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao knelt down in front of the Golden Tree and respectfully kowtowed thrice. After this, he stood up and walked into the Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sea God’s Pavilion was very quiet right now. After entering, he didn’t sense anyone’s aura. He couldn’t use his Spiritual Detection either, as he didn’t want to alarm the elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was feeling a little depressed right now. It was already evening, but he didn’t know where to go for the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date! There wasn’t even anyone to ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at this moment, his stomach started growling. He hadn’t eaten in a few days, and his stomach was revolting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he thought of eating, Huo Yuhao started to salivate. The food in the inner courtyard had always been very tempting. To ensure that the students were fully nourished for their cultivation, the food in the inner courtyard had always been made from the best ingredients on the continent, and delicately prepared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only was the food nourishing, it was also very tasty. It was one of the programs that the inner courtyard disciples enjoyed most. When they were still at the Academy, Shrek’s Seven Monsters would constantly find excuses to come over to Sea God’s Island and have a meal. They wouldn’t leave without filling their stomachs.</span></p>
