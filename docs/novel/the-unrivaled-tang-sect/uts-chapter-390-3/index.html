 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

However, they still needed time if they wanted to take action. The savage beasts in the Great Star Dou Forest couldn’t just attack Shrek City, as the strength of Shrek Academy would make them think twice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t predict exactly what was going to happen. He could only try to deal with the situation through the most suitable plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was in fact a very emotional person. However, after he fused with this Three-Eyed Golden Lion skull, gusts of refreshing cold would seep into his spiritual sea and force him back to his rational state every time he lost control over his emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this wasn’t a comfortable feeling, as his emotions were being suppressed by his rationality. However, Huo Yuhao couldn’t resist this rationality in the current situation he was in. The crisis that Wang Qiu’er had brought about was probably more terrifying than the Sun Moon Empire capturing hundreds of hostages. And he would be the most important figure in resolving this crisis. How could he possibly be relaxed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the Skydream Iceworm had said, a huge forest appeared within his vision after he flew &nbsp;towards the north for less than two hours.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Star Dou Forest was very close to the center of the Douluo Continent, and so it had a temperate climate, but this forest was closer to the north, and thus was coniferous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, this coniferous forest was filled with dark-greyish branches and leaves. It was extremely dark. Before entering it, a sense of suppression had already swept over him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was definitely the Evildemon Forest. Huo Yuhao slowly descended from the sky and landed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soul masters with common sense wouldn’t attempt to fly over a forest where there were many soul beasts. That was no different from suicide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t even stop to analyze the situation. He quickly entered the forest and immediately rushed toward the center of this forest based on the direction that he had determined while in the air earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was self-confidence, his self-confidence in his own abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was five years ago, he would have been very cautious, and wouldn’t have dared to venture into the forest. However, he was completely different now. He possessed immense spiritual power that surpassed even that of Titled Douluo, and the abilities of the god beast of Destiny. He was now completely able to summon good fortune and avoid calamities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t need to deliberately unleash his soul skills. His spiritual power was already like a fine web that had been scattered, rapidly spreading into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, Huo Yuhao discovered that the concentration of soul beasts here was greater than in the Jing Yang Mountain Range. It was indeed the place in the Sun Moon Continent that had the most soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To prevent wasting time through fighting, Huo Yuhao used a summon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ice Empress.” A streak of golden light flashed, and a jade-green figure appeared beside Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Huo Yuhao’s first time seeing the Ice Empress in her human form. Her delicate looks made her seem less arrogant than the mature Snow Empress, but she was much cooler and more elegant. There were four streaks of demonic patterns on each of the sides of her captivating, silky-white face. Her long dark green hair flowed behind her back, but her snow-white skin looked as if it were transparent. Jade-green light shone beneath her skin. When she appeared, the surrounding temperature started to decline significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress’ height was similar to Huo Yuhao’s. She looked very cold, and her gaze only turned gentler when she looked in Huo Yuhao’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll have to trouble you.” Huo Yuhao nodded slightly to the Ice Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry.” The Ice Empress’ voice was crisp and pleasant, but there was a chill in it that seemed to originate from her bones. She didn’t do anything apart from advancing with Huo Yuhao. An aura that was special to the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion was also released from her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She controlled the aura that she released very well. She didn’t unleash it fully. With her cultivation before she fused with Huo Yuhao, she might really draw the Evil Emperor out if she unleashed her real aura. If that happened, there would be huge trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She only subtly exuded slight traces of the aura of a hundred thousand year soul beast, which managed to suppress and immobilize the nearby soul beasts, who were of weaker cultivations. The soul beasts that were closer to her were even worse off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could see through his Spiritual Detection that the soul beasts within a few thousand square meters had all retreated as he advanced. Those who were weak were even paralyzed, and collapsed to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t willing to kill soul beasts because of Wang Qiu’er. This was why he used the Ice Empress’ aura. Although the Ice Empress didn’t become his Spirit like the Snow Empress and Skydream Iceworm, she could still materialize into a physical form through Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power and remain outside of his body for long periods of time. She controlled her own bloodline and aura in Huo Yuhao’s body, which helped Huo Yuhao conserve his energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Huo Yuhao didn’t lack spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When necessary, the Ice Empress could help him fight. However, she would have to use his soul power to do so. How much of her abilities she could use depended on how much soul power she could take from Huo Yuhao. After all, the Ice Empress had given him his Ice Jade Empress Scorpion, and not his Spirit Eyes. As for the Skydream Iceworm, he could help Huo Yuhao fight and use his spiritual power. However, he wasn’t very adept at fighting. Rather than ask him to fight, it was better for Huo Yuhao to control his own spiritual power to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just that an extra form of intelligence and control could help Huo Yuhao do things ordinary people couldn’t at special moments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was venturing into this forest in a straight line. What he needed to do now was use the shortest time possible to find a soul beast that was suitable to be his seventh soul ring. He would hunt and absorb the soul ring before quickly returning to Shrek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, he had already passed the outer regions of the forest, and the soul beasts around him gradually became stronger. Hundred year soul beasts were everywhere, while thousand year soul beasts were occasionally present. It was just that they avoided Huo Yuhao and the Ice Empress because of the Ice Empress’ aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four hours later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, be careful. We’ve entered the core region of this forest. There will be ten thousand year soul beasts here. In addition, we might even face stronger existences. Perhaps you can find what you are looking for.” The Ice Empress warned Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao also understood what she was saying, and nodded. He replied, “Thanks for your help. I can take over from now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Ice Empress continued to stay outside, his presence would become too obvious. There was a high possibility that he might meet a strong soul beast as he entered the core region of this forest. Traces of the aura of a hundred thousand year soul beast might not deter the soul beasts in this region. On the contrary, it might even attract stronger soul beasts. This was why Huo Yuhao decided to adopt a low-profile from here on out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gentle halo formed distorted light patterns around his body. Very soon, he melded with everything around him, and his own aura was also blocked by this halo. It seemed as if he had vanished into thin air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was still using his spiritual power to unleash his Imitation. However, he was truly concealing himself right now. Even if he had to enter Sunrise City again, he could fly into the city without fear of being discovered. Unless he was scanned by a Class 8 surveillance soul tool, or something stronger, it was almost impossible to detect him. In addition, a Class 8 soul engineer was also needed to operate a Class 8 surveillance soul tool capable of detecting him. There weren’t too many soul engineers in the entire continent that were at least Class 8!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for soul beasts, only hundred thousand year soul beasts would be able to detect him through their own innate gifts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao started to become more cautious as he ventured deeper into this forest. He didn’t expand the area that his Spiritual Detection covered, but shrank it instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more experienced one was, the lesser bold he would become. The Evileye Tyrants resided in the Evildemon Forest. They were rare spiritual-type soul beasts and were naturally more sensitive to spiritual undulations. As a result, Huo Yuhao didn’t dare to be careless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His soft-heartedness and carelessness led him into a crisis which eventually cost Wang Qiu’er her life.

It dragged a thick, three meter-long tail behind it.</span></p>
