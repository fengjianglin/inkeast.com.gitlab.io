 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they looked at each other, they could see the excitement in each other’s eyes. They knew that they had found another way to improve. While this couldn’t be directly used on a battlefield, it was still very beneficial to them if they wanted to last in a fight. As long as they had a little time to rest, they could recharge and restore their energy at the fastest speed. They managed to fully tap into the advantages of having Yin-Yang Complement soul cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them quickly entered a cultivation state. Their four soul cores fused and intersected. As they resisted one another, brand-new soul power was unleashed once again. Their cultivations were also increasing dramatically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, forming Yin-Yang Complement soul cores had already given them the potential to experience significant improvements in their cultivations. Tang Wutong had also managed to form Yin-Yang Complement soul cores with Huo Yuhao’s help. This was unprecedented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, most of Tang Wutong’s spiritual power in her spiritual soul core came from Huo Yuhao. She had absorbed, transformed and turned his spiritual power into her own spiritual power. This made their spiritual power even much more compatible. This was also why they had no problems fusing their martial souls, and once again generated Haodong Power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, their Haodong Power was far, far stronger now than it was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While they were threatened by the Death God Douluo earlier, Huo Yuhao was in fact not afraid of her at all. What he was afraid of was that Long Xiaoyao would do everything he could to help her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since he had interacted with Long Xiaoyao, he became more and more curious about him. His abilities were undoubted, given that he was also from the same generation as Elder Mu. It wasn’t even overboard to say that he was the strongest human in the world right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, why was he willing to be used by Ye Xishui? Since he could make his name along with Elder Mu, it also meant that his character wasn’t too flawed either. Or this was what Huo Yuhao felt, at the very least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Elder Mu had also mentioned that he was helping him. However, Huo Yuhao realized that his help for Ye Xishui was always unselfish every time he saw him. It was definitely not a formality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But why is this so? Is he being controlled by her? Impossible! When Long Xiaoyao and Elder Mu made their name, Ye Xishui wasn’t even so strong. So why could she controlled Long Xiaoyao so easily? It’s really ridiculous for an Ultimate Douluo to be under this kind of restriction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, if this isn’t the case, why is he listening to her?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This doubt kept on racing in Huo Yuhao’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why he didn’t dare to take the risk. Against the Death God Douluo, he and Tang Wutong wouldn’t be at too much of a disadvantage even if they couldn’t beat her. However, things would be different if Long Xiaoyao got involved. They might not even have an opportunity to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why Huo Yuhao was very careful. He didn’t even reveal his Morning Dew Dagger, because he wanted to only use it at the most critical of times – when they had to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, Long Xiaoyao didn’t abet Ye Xishui. Ye Xishui even chose not to attack, and left because she was giving Long Xiaoyao face. This also left Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, their thirst for strength also grew because of this incident. Their earlier satisfaction and perhaps arrogance had ceased to exist. To fight Ultimate Douluo, it was paramount for one to become one too. Long Xiaoyao’s advice was indeed golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong quickly entered cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their soul power was around Rank 95 now. They had just become Transcendent Douluo. However, this wasn’t really anything major. It wasn’t the crux of the problem. Given their cultivation speed, Huo Yuhao was completely confident of raising his soul power by another rank. In less than two years, they would be at Rank 98. This was the major benefit brought about by their Yin-Yang Complement soul cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I wonder what teacher asked Long Xiaoyao to pass to us when we reach Rank 98?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was actually very curious. This was because Mu En didn’t mention this when he had helped him form his twin soul cores. This was why he was feeling rather anxious in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Elder Xuan knew the Dragon Emperor Douluo, he would have immediately told Huo Yuhao that the Dragon Emperor Douluo was lying. The reason was very simple. This was because Elder Mu had really passed away, and his soul had dissipated. If there was anything he had left for Huo Yuhao, he would have told Elder Xuan before he died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a pity that Huo Yuhao didn’t know all this. He was still thinking of finding the Dragon Emperor Douluo after he made a breakthrough, so as to find out what was actually going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s soul power was increasing under their mutual influence. Cultivation didn’t affect Huo Yuhao’s sense of the outside world. His immense spiritual power naturally formed a spiritual forcefield. This forcefield spread, and even the path connecting the Sun Moon Empire and that mountain valley was engulfed within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sun Moon Empire army, commander tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two days had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since Ye Xishui had attacked, two days had passed. She didn’t appear again. However, her single appearance had already left all the soldiers traumatized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was too strong. The two of them had managed to resist the Sun Moon Empire’s linked offensive attacks, and even almost destroyed their linked defensive soul tools. What kind of power did they possess? Two Ultimate Douluo were actually so terrifying. It was beyond everyone’s imagination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not many soldiers had been killed, but the surviving ones were under a great psychological burden. Because of this, many of the advanced-tier soul engineers had not even smiled for two complete days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They finally realized the truth now. They finally understood how strong the Holy Ghost Church was. In terms of higher-end combat strength, they were still the best in the empire!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">News of the attack had been sent to the capital. However, it seemed to have disappeared. No news was transmitted back. It seemed like Xu Tianran had given up on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is it a lesson for us?” Ju Zi muttered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two days were enough for her to think through many things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the Death God Douluo was relentless, she wouldn’t have used such a method. Even if she cared about face a lot, she could just use her Light of the Death God when our defenses are at their weakest every day, if she wanted to use brute force. The army would continuously suffer damage, and we’d keep on living in fear. It would be almost impossible for us to chase after them too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she didn’t so. This means that she’s still very concerned about the Holy Ghost Church’s position in the empire. She won’t do anything anytime soon. It’s just that I don’t know what they’re up to next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was very unsettled. She was even more willing to face the violent Ye Xishui, rather than not face her at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, I must destroy the Holy Ghost Church. Otherwise, there won’t be any peace in the empire in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she thought of the strengths of the two Ultimate Douluo, Ju Zi couldn’t help but shudder. In the future, this empire would belong to her son. How could she tolerate outsiders in the empire? With them around, the rule of the empire would be greatly influenced.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Son, don’t worry. No matter how difficult it is, I’ll help you get rid of these obstacles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was immediately inspired to fight when she thought of her son. Her earlier cowardice disappeared. To a mother, she wouldn’t fear any enemy if it was to protect her own kid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Report!” A frantic voice shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi calmed down a little before saying, “Report.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The empire’s reinforcements were attacked outside the valley. All of them have been killed. When we arrived to help them, there were only corpses. All their resources have been taken too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Ju Zi was aghast. She looked horrified, “What have you discovered?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The messenger lifted his head. After hesitating for a moment, he replied, “There are traces of spectral creatures. Our aerial surveillance soul tools also discovered something like a Bone Dragon flying into the distance. The aura of spectral creatures has also been left behind. The thousand soul engineers that were sent to help have all been…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thousand soul engineers! Even if they were from the reserves, they were still trained by the empire. With the help of these thousand soul engineers, she could replenish everything she had lost at the front lines. How could she not be enraged now that everything was gone?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she also felt a little weird just as she was enraged. This was because she knew that Ye Xishui’s attack had ended, and her attack was already enough to strike fear into her troops. Why did she attack again? The Holy Ghost Church was the prime suspect because of the spectral aura. Unless…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi thought of something, and immediately recalled the magical dimension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuhao, is it you?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she thought that Huo Yuhao could be nearby, Ju Zi started to become more energized. Her earlier rage also disappeared.</span></p>
