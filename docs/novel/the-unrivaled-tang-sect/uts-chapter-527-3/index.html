 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This little fellow wasn’t picky with his food. He was eating very happily, and naturally stopped crying because he had something to eat. But his large black eyes were staring at Huo Yuhao from the beginning to the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reality proved that this one-year-old child wasn’t just able to eat food for grown men; he could even walk. Even though he didn’t walk very stably, the little child who should be Xu Yunhan began to walk by himself when Huo Yuhao let him go. Furthermore, he wasn’t uncomfortable with strangers, and he stopped crying once he was full. He was all smiles, and the way he smiled made all the Titled Douluo react with kind and amiable expressions. What a cute little baby!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The little child returned in front of Huo Yuhao after circling around, and seemed to stare at him very seriously before he exclaimed babyishly, “Daddy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao almost jumped to his feet in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This child wasn’t the only person to call him “daddy”. The Snow Lady had called him that before. But Huo Yuhao realized to his surprise that he was only awkward and embarrassed when the Snow Lady called him that, but when this little fellow called him that, he felt shaken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There seemed to be some kind of formless fate in the nether that tied them together when the little boy uttered that word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao possessed the Eye of Destiny, and he was extremely sensitive to it. He seemed to feel like his destiny was connected to this little fellow when the child called to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He made his decision in that moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took the baby back into his arms as he said teasingly, “What’s your name?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yunhan.” The baby replied very cleanly. Huo Yuhao realized from interacting with the baby that Xu Yunhan was already very good with words, even if he could only say a few. The baby had to be very familiar with those words, otherwise he wouldn’t be able to speak them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao subconsciously kissed the baby on his tender little cheeks. Xu Yunhan’s chubby cheeks were soft and bouncy, and his smooth and tender skin was just like his mother’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehehe!” The little child seemed to feel ticklish as he withdrew his neck and laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed as well. This kid was just too cute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong came over and began to tease little Yunhan with Huo Yuhao. She giggled and said, “Seems like you’re quite good with kids. Did you teach yourself?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chuckled. “You might as well say that I’m naturally talented. I will be an excellent father when we have kids in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong blushed, but she didn’t avoid his gentle gaze. Her eyes were brimming with happiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smiling face suddenly cut in between them in this moment, and two large eyes stared at Tang Wutong seriously. “Daddy, mine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong couldn’t help but laugh. “Your daddy isn’t here, he’s…” She suddenly paused when she said those words, and dejection appeared in her eyes as she glanced at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s smile disappeared at the same time, and he gently caressed Xu Yunhan’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some more time passed as the little fellow fell asleep because he was full and tired from playing, and everyone took off once more. The Titled Douluo didn’t say anything, but anybody would realize upon closer inspection that the atmosphere between everyone was conspicuously more tense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were flying far too quickly, and the Sun Moon Empire’s territory was so wide. Those who were pursuing them couldn’t catch up because there was no way they could lock onto their positions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao relied on his formidable Spiritual Detection as he successfully took everyone across the border’s defenses once more. They returned to the Ming Dou Mountain Range and directly descended towards the mountain range’s main peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Titled Douluo’s expressions were a lot more relaxed when they returned. They were finally back, and even though their mission wasn’t perfect, they had accomplished at least half of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had heavily injured the Sun Moon Empire’s Emperor, Xu Tianran, and managed to capture the Sun Moon Empire’s crown prince, Xu Yunhan. But at the same time, the Body Douluo remained in the Sun Moon Empire forever, and would never return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke welcomed them personally. He stared at everyone’s solemn expressions, and his eyes dimmed when he didn’t see Du Busi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke turned to Huo Yuhao when they arrived inside the commander’s tent. “Tell me what happened, Yuhao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded. He was still carrying Xu Yunhan in his arms, and the little fellow was sleeping very soundly. He immediately recounted everything that he had seen on this mission in detail, except he didn’t tell the White Tiger Duke about the Body Douluo handing him the Secrets of the Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke shut his eyes painfully after listening to his report. After a few moments, he said, “The Body Douluo realized his wish. He had already told me that before everyone departed. He couldn’t recover from his old injuries, and he wanted to give his full strength to assassinate Xu Tianran on this mission. Back then, I already felt like something was wrong. And it seems like he had planned this a long time ago…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone lowered their heads gloomily, especially those formidable individuals from the Body Sect. The Body Douluo’s death undoubtedly meant the Body Sect’s fall from glory. In addition to the large masses of their elites who had perished in the war, the Body Sect probably wouldn’t regain their strength even after a few hundred years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke finally trained his eyes on Xu Yunhan, who was still in Huo Yuhao’s arms. A complicated look appeared in his eyes. Capturing the crown prince wasn’t his idea. He had been heroic and valiant his entire life, but now he was using a child to threaten the Sun Moon Empire. He wasn’t willing at all, from the bottom of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the Sun Moon Empire was far too powerful, and if they didn’t have a plan to counter them, the White Tiger Duke wasn’t confident at all of defending his empire’s territory when the Sun Moon Empire’s enormous empire descended upon them like a thunderstorm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned to the White Tiger Duke with a calm look on his face. “What shall we do with the child, Duke? What are you planning to do with him?” The word he used was “you”, not “us”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hesitation appeared in the White Tiger Duke’s eyes as he said subconsciously, “What suggestions do you have, Yuhao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said without hesitation, “War is an affair for men. It has nothing to do with children. No matter who he is, he’s still a child. We are honorable men, so how can we use an infant to threaten our enemies? That’s not honorable at all. Furthermore, with the Sun Moon Empire’s Emperor’s personality, kidnapping the crown prince will lose its meaning, since he isn’t dead. He can have one crown prince, so why can’t he bear another?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s words were very precise. If the Body Douluo, Du Busi had assassinated Xu Tianran successfully, then the Douluo Continent’s three native empires wouldn’t have to do anything if they captured the crown prince. The Sun Moon Empire would naturally descend into chaos because everyone would be fighting for control of the throne.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire wouldn’t have a leader, while the ruler had no heir. Who wouldn’t want to rule over such a powerful empire?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Xu Tianran was still alive, so the Sun Moon Empire couldn’t truly be that chaotic. Kidnapping the crown prince under such circumstances perhaps wouldn’t have its desired effect, unless Xu Tianran placed a lot of importance on that son of his, and was willing to pay a tremendous price for him. Otherwise, if he really did abandon the crown prince, then everything that everyone did would become meaningless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What you’re saying is that capturing the crown prince is useless?” The Heavenly Sun Douluo’s voice was suddenly a little higher than before. They went through so much to kidnap the crown prince, and even though Huo Yuhao’s words sounded virtuous, he had still touched a nerve. That was especially so for the other Titled Douluo who were with the Heavenly Sun Douluo in capturing the crown prince. Everyone showed displeased expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “I didn’t mean to offend. But if I had known that our mission’s target was a child, nothing would have convinced me to participate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo stared at him coldly and said, “Child? This child’s father is the one who commanded the Sun Moon Empire’s army to sweep over the Heavenly Soul Empire, and if that didn’t happen, why would the Body Douluo sacrifice himself? His sacrifice created the opportunity for us to kidnap the crown prince. You’re so young, but your tongue is sharp, and yet you think you stand on the moral high ground. Do you think that’s enough to save your country? So what if we do despicable things for our country?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao answered plainly, “The reason why the Body Douluo chose to attack the sacrificial platform instead of personally kidnapping this child was probably because he felt it was beneath his dignity. Otherwise, on the day of the ceremony, all of the Sun Moon Empire’s high-level officials would be watching the sacrificial platform. Even without a diversion, what do you think the Body Douluo’s chances would have been if he had snuck into the royal palace to kidnap this child, with his strength? Aren’t you guys aware?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s faces changed once more as they heard his words. The Titled Douluo’s expressions became even blacker than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo turned to the White Tiger Duke and said, “Duke, Huo Yuhao did contribute a lot to this operation, and he was a great help to us. Now that the mission has been completed, he can return to Shrek Academy. We should be the ones discussing what comes next. He’s a junior, and he doesn’t have to continue participating.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke nodded and turned to Huo Yuhao. “Yuhao, the Heavenly Sun Douluo is right. You have already helped us a lot on this mission. You should go back and rest, and return to the academy as quickly as possible. We’ll deal with the rest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could he not agree with what Huo Yuhao said deep in his heart? But their enemy was near, and he could only choose to protect Huo Yuhao as much as possible with so many Titled Douluo in front of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke walked in front of Huo Yuhao and took Xu Yunhan from him as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression was a little blank. He fixed his eyes on the White Tiger Duke, and when the Duke took the baby, Huo Yuhao suddenly asked, “Duke, sir, if your son was the one who was kidnapped and your enemies wanted you to pay a price, would you do it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was momentarily stunned. He suddenly felt that Huo Yuhao’s gaze was a little blinding, but he still answered without hesitation, “If my enemy’s price was personal, then I would give my own life to save my child. But if my enemy’s price was for me to betray my country, then I would avenge my son!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao suddenly laughed out loud and said, “Good, good, you will avenge your son. You live up to your name as a loyal and righteous Duke! Haha, hahahaha!” Huo Yuhao pulled Tang Wutong along as he laughed before he turned and left.</span></p>
