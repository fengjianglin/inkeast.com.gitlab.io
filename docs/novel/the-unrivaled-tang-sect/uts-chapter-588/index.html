 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no way we would all die so easily! After all, I have already lived for a million years. I am definitely tougher than you think. However, we are also not quite sure what happened. To be honest, we just felt an immense amount of energy surging into your body, which accelerated our recovery. After that, we just woke up after one another. We were about to ask you what happened because we couldn’t sense what was going on outside at all. Now that your spiritual power has become so strong, there’s no way we can sense what is going on outside without your permission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All of you are not dead? And you mentioned an immense amount of energy?” Huo Yuhao was also stunned by what he had just heard. He turned his head to look at the Ice Empress and Snow Empress, only to find them nodding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, many questions started to form in Huo Yuhao’s mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unless I hadn’t turned into an idiot back then? Or could everything before me be a dream? No, no, that can’t be right. I seem to be able to control everything around me. This means I must still be alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, Huo Yuhao felt a warm sensation in his heart. His entire body seemed to be brimming with power and strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me go out and take a look.” Following which, he immediately returned to his body after signaling the slightest intent. At the same time, he was observing the situation of his body from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was immediately shocked by what he saw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first things he saw were two vortexes, which belonged to his soul cores. Both vortexes were now close to twice their original size. The gems which were forming within the soul core vortexes were now a lot more apparent than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two different vortexes were golden and blue. Each of them was releasing an immensely powerful soul power which was fusing and interacting with one another. The brilliant golden-blue light was rippling between the two soul cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tiny soul power vortexes which were being released by the interactions between the two soul cores now resembled pearls. Because of how much energy was contained within them, one would mistake them as a complete material object rather than just a vortex of energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time Huo Yuhao was sensing this. It was simply magical. He felt as though his body was brimming with power, and that he had attained new heights in his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was almost as if his passageways and organs had already disappeared. He felt as though his entire body had become uniform, just like an entire continent. His soul cores were like the sun and the moon which shone on this huge continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden sun and blue moon had allowed him to comprehend certain laws which governed the universe. It seemed like his soul cores were not only sources of power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the transformations in his body were not what startled Huo Yuhao the most. Most importantly, why was all of this happening to him? If he was fine, was Tang Wutong also fine? How was she doing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that his consciousness had completely returned, Huo Yuhao gradually opened his eyes. When he opened his eyes, he instantly realized that he was still in the room at the top floor of the Clear Sky Sect. However, Tai Tan and Tang Wutong were no longer in the room. It seemed like he was the only person left here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Where is Wutong?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Huo Yuhao was startled, he found himself floating before landing on the ground with a single intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately scanned his surroundings by releasing his Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he was executing his Spiritual Detection, he was surprised to find it working without mustering any of his spiritual power. It seemed like his techniques could now be activated with his intent. Following which, a three-dimensional diagram of Clear Sky Castle formed in his head. Every single living thing was presented in the diagram. In fact, even the slightest detail was captured by his Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, Tang Wutong doesn’t seem to be here.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;He could only sense the mighty life energy of Tai Tan and Niu Tian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On top of that, he was now absolutely certain that the Sect Leader of the Clear Sky Sect, Niu Tian, must be an Ultimate Douluo. On the other hand, Tai Tan was at least a Transcendent Douluo. Both of their bodies seemed to possess an explosive type of power. The fact that the power they were releasing was already so powerful implied that they were probably in possession of something even more frightening within their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Where’s Wutong?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, this was the only thought on Huo Yuhao’s mind. He instantly dashed out of the room before teleporting to where Tai Tan and Niu Tian were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both Niu Tian and Tai Tan were sitting in a spacious room enjoying a cup of wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were both startled by Huo Yuhao’s sudden appearance. After realizing that their intruder was Huo Yuhao, the startled looks on their faces broke out into faint smiles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uncle Niu Tian and Uncle Tai Tan, where is Wutong? How is she doing? Has all the death aura within her body been expelled? Do you all know where she is? Did anything bad happen to her?” Huo Yuhao went on like a machine gun as he fired a series of questions at both Niu Tian and Tai Tan. They were, of course, caught off-guard by the number of questions being thrown at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, first, you need to relax.” Tai Tan chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s anxiety was written all over his face. How could he relax right now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Niu Tian pointed outside of the window and spoke, “Go and see for yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao rose to the window as he peered out of it. He saw something he would never forget for the rest of his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pure white clouds were drifting about in the air as they rapidly morphed between different shapes. At times, they were surging about like violet waves in the sky before changing into all sorts of sculptures at the very next instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A beautiful violet-colored figure was dancing gracefully within these rapidly changing clouds. As she stepped on the clouds enshrouding her figure, her body radiated a faint golden glow. She looked like a fairy emerging from the clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Coupled with her graceful dance and her long violet hair, she was radiating an irresistible attraction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A golden sun and a purple moon were suspended above her head as they showered her with radiant light. Their lights further enhanced her fairy-like image.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As her powerful soul power fluctuations rippled across the sky, the clouds around her changed colors continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao leaped up into the sky as he headed for the clouds. Gentle soul power fluctuations were rippling from his body. In fact, they were no longer soul power fluctuations. They were manifestations of his love for Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pure feelings of love and admiration were, of course, the best possible emotions! An image that belonged to Rong Nianbing flickered behind Huo Yuhao, and the surrounding clouds turned golden in color at the next instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao opened his arms as he flew towards Tang Wutong. At this instant, there was nothing in his eyes but her beautiful figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong had naturally seen him as a faint smile formed on her face. However, she moved aside and dodged Huo Yuhao’s embrace before hiding in the clouds with a giggle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stunned, and he immediately dashed straight into the clouds. However, he realized that Tang Wutong was no longer in the cloud he had seen her enter. He immediately unleashed his Spiritual Detection only to find the surrounding clouds to be brimming with Tang Wutong’s soul power. His Spiritual Detection was actually unable to locate her exact position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right! Now that she’s in possession of Yin Yang Complement soul cores, her spiritual power and soul power would have fused perfectly. The soul power she had released must possess the characteristics of her spiritual power. That’s why I won’t be able to locate her with my Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao started to become anxious. He was really afraid that everything he was seeing was just an illusion. Right now, he only wanted to get close to her and touch her. He needed to make sure that everything was real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A blue moon silently ascended behind Huo Yuhao. Following which, Huo Yuhao planted his palm gently on the clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that instant, he felt the blue soul core at his chest area rotate. The powerful blue vortex seemed to have appeared in his palm instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The huge patches of clouds outside of Clear Sky Castle were instantly enshrouded by extreme cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single water-type element was frozen immediately. At that instant, every single cloud within fifty kilometers of Huo Yuhao transformed into chunks of ice which dropped to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the clouds dropped down, Huo Yuhao was able to see Tang Wutong again. She was shocked to see what Huo Yuhao had done. At the same time, it seemed like she was a little displeased with what Huo Yuhao had done to the beautiful clouds she had made.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao couldn't care less about those clouds. He no longer wanted to be tortured by their separation. He immediately teleported to where Tang Wutong was as he opened his arms to hug her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong also teleported at the same time. However, she merely moved back by a single step. She extended her arms to hold Huo Yuhao’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao felt the familiar warmth in his hands, he felt as though his heart was about to melt in bliss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when he was about to speak, he suddenly felt two streaks of soul power surging from Tang Wutong’s body. Before he could even react, he realized his soul power had actually fused with Tang Wutong’s soul power. Their bodies lit up at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden sun and purple moon above Tang Wutong’s head immediately drifted towards Huo Yuhao, while his golden sun and blue moon instantly appeared behind his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden suns overlapped with one another before ascending further into the sky. The blue moon and purple moon overlapped with one another to become a violet full moon. The full moon’s radiance overlapped with the golden sun’s radiance to release an awe-inspiring sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao’s bodies became illusory at the same time. Following which, the light their bodies were radiating seemed to have become material and solid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Initially, the light seemed to dim before it suddenly exploded with blinding radiance. At that instant, Huo Yuhao felt as though his mind had turned completely blank. The explosive radiance they released seemed to have shattered the space around them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This must be fusion! My martial soul and Wutong’s martial soul can finally fuse again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, they were now able to fuse again. Now that Tang Wutong had acquired her Yin Yang Complement soul cores, their martial souls were now compatible again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the end of the day, their Haodong Power was still Haodong Power. However, it had undergone a tremendous transformation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of their soul cores had expanded by more than thirty percent. It was important to note that a thirty percent expansion in diameter meant that their volume would have gained an even larger increase! Hence, their collective power had improved exponentially. In addition, both of their powers had also multiplied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the power of Yin Yang Complement soul cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, both of them had a pair of Yin Yang Complement soul cores. If one were to look at them with a different perspective, both of them were also like a pair of soul cores. Huo Yuhao would be the Yang, while Tang Wutong would be the Yin. Hence, their Haodong Power would also receive a similar Yin Yang Complement boost. Such enhancement was definitely unprecedented in the history of soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong instantly fused together to become a single entity. Following which, they released a streak of golden light into the distant sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The diameter of this golden beam of light was at least a hundred meters. It was so long that their eyes could not see the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first martial soul fusion skill they had unleashed when they had first fused their martial souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was definitely the ultimate version of the skill! It was truly an endless golden road.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them seem to have transformed back into their normal forms immediately after they had taken on the shape of the gigantic eye. Huo Yuhao immediately brought Tang Wutong deeper into his embrace as he hugged her soft and scented body. This sensation allowed him to be sure that everything was real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Improving his cultivation was really not that important to him. As long as she was around and fine, that was enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why were you so foolish to block that dagger for me?” Huo Yuhao’s voice trembled as he choked on his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong burst into laughter as she laughed, “You’re the foolish one. If you were in my place, would you not have done that? You are my one and only love. Are you the only one that is allowed to protect me? Am I not allowed to protect you? We need gender equality in our relationship.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">HuoYuhao tightened his embrace as he whispered, “Do you know that if you had really died there and then, I would definitely have taken my life and followed you. I want to be wherever you are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course I know that. That’s why I can’t bear to be separated from you, my dear fool!” Tang Wutong giggled. However, while she was laughing, tears were already streaming down her cheeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, Niu Tian and Tai Tan were watching the couple who were locked in an embrace from the windows of Clear Sky Castle. Both of them revealed a warm smile on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These two fellows have finally gotten together. I’m really happy for them. It’s exactly like how Wutong’s mother got together with that fellow. That fellow must have been touched by how Yuhao was willing to give up his cultivation for Wutong. He must have seen how Yuhao wanted to fuse his Yin Yang Complement soul cores with her martial soul. This time around, both of them seemed to have benefited a lot from this tribulation. They have both become Transcendent Douluo. The fact that they have both attained the rank of a Transcendent Doluo at such a young age means that they probably have a chance to match the record of that person from ten thousand years ago!” Tai Tan remarked with admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Niu Tian coughed and said, “Alright, that’s enough. If I remember correctly, I think you once liked Xiao Wu when she was in her human form, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shhhhh! Can you not be so loud? Do you not know how easy it is for that fellow to become jealous? Look at how he has been torturing his future son-in-law. I can only imagine what he would do to the person who tries to snatch away his woman.” Tai Tan spoke in a timid fashion which was completely different from the usual machismo he showed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing what Tai Tan had said, Niu Tian burst into laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was hugging Tang Wutong very tightly, and wished that he could bring her body as close as possible to his. After a short while, his mind started to clear up, and a question formed in his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I am embracing Wutong tightly! How is that possible? Why isn’t the seal reacting to it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he thought about it, he tried to increase his grip around Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Still, there was no reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can you be gentler?” Tang Wutong grumbled in her usual adorable way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately let go of Tang Wutong and asked her, “Why is there no reaction?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong blushed and said, “My father visited earlier. After seeing what you were willing to do for me, he…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was immensely elated after hearing this. Even though Tang Wutong was not yet done with her sentence, only a fool would not understand what she was trying to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, future father-in-law! You’re the best!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately lowered his head as he stared at Tang Wutong with passionate eyes. He looked at the pink tender lips before his eyes as he slowly lowered his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong immediately blushed, but she did not try to avoid Huo Yuhao. She raised her arms and placed them around his neck.</span></p>
