 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei nodded and answered, “Yes! Although my great-grandfather has already passed away, he sealed his spirit in the Golden Tree. When the beast wave started, and Di Tian attacked, Elder Xuan wasn’t able to handle him on his own, and my great-grandfather used the power of the Golden Tree to seal Di Tian along with Elder Xuan!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher!” Huo Yuhao peered into the sky and the emotions that he had been suppressing finally burst out. His tears flowed, and he knelt down as he continued staring up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, a deafening boom echoed across the sky. Following this, a huge golden figure separated itself from the sky before descending towards Shrek City. The entire sky instantly turned dark, and an indescribable, yet terrifying aura descended from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian had finally broken the seal! Furious dragon roars resonated across the sky, and patches of purple burned in the sky around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That golden figure that had separated itself from the sky turned back into its human form. It was Elder Xuan, and the projection of Elder Mu subtly surfaced beside him. However, he was much, much weaker than before. He also seemed very pale, and there were fresh bloodstains around his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sealing the Golden Eyes Black Dragon King, whose cultivation exceeded eight hundred thousand years, had over-stimulated his blood, and Elder Xuan was also greatly drained in the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like Di Tian could sense what was happening in the outside world, Elder Mu and Elder Xuan could do the same, too. Even they didn’t expect that Shrek City could hold on without reinforcements, given the ferocious beast wave. They had also inflicted many casualties on the Great Star Dou Forest’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More than forty percent of the soul beast army had been killed! This was an extremely heavy blow to the forest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Elder Mu and Elder Xuan were very proud of Shrek’s fighting strength, they didn’t think this was a good thing. This situation virtually compelled Di Tian and the Great Star Dou Forest to wipe out Shrek completely. Even if the soul beasts had to retreat, they wouldn’t be willing to spare Shrek after the immense losses that Shrek had inflicted on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian was so furious that he was close to going berserk. There was no point in saying anything else at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the soul beast armies on the northern and western sides were greatly fatigued, the Beast God’s mighty aura was finally felt again, and they distributed themselves once again under the command of the four Savage Beasts. The soul beast army on the western side displayed an attacking formation and was waiting for Di Tian’s order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, spots of light started to appear in the distance. These spots were very attention-catching, though there weren’t many of them. At least, there weren’t more than the spectral army Huo Yuhao had summoned. However, they managed to fly over rapidly even as they faced Di Tian’s immense suppression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was especially true for a green spot that was flying in the front. It was like a shooting star. Furthermore, it expanded in size as it charged forward. Slowly, it turned into a huge, green fireball. Even against Di Tian’s suppression, it still continued to burst forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Di Tian, you have to see whether I agree if you want to destroy Shrek! Let’s fight again after a hundred years!” a vigorous voice called out, resonating across the entire sky, and a huge patch of green light instantly filled the sky. Di Tian’s immense suppression was forcefully resisted just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing this voice, Elder Xuan’s tense face relaxed a little. Reinforcements had finally arrived. He was both very disgusted and irked by the owner of that voice. However, it sounded extremely cordial to him right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How many people were there in the Douluo Continent that could resist the Beast God’s suppression on his own? The owner of that voice was none other than the sect leader of the Body Sect, the Body Douluo Du Busi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, the Body Sect had arrived as reinforcements!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whether it was Elder Xuan, Elder Mi, or the elders from the Sea God’s Pavilion, no one had expected the Body Sect to be the first to arrive as reinforcements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek Academy and the Body Sect didn’t share a harmonious relationship. The fight between Elder Mu and Du Busi’s brother was a painful and tragic memory for both parties. Elder Mu’s back was bent out of shape following that fight, and he eventually passed away from his condition, while Du Busi’s brother died early.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While this hatred between both parties wasn’t unforgettable, it was still deeply remembered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Du Busi actually arrived just when Shrek Academy needed help the most. It hadn’t even been two days! Even if news was passed down to them immediately, and they set off immediately, they might not have been so quick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Du Busi’s cultivation was slightly superior to Elder Xuan’s, and he was already an Ultimate Douluo. Even though he had just become an Ultimate Douluo, and his abilities were weaker than the Darkness Holy Dragon and the Dragon Emperor Douluo Long Xiaoyao, he was still one of the strongest soul masters in the world right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Di Tian, who was already hurt after breaking the seal, could still defeat him, he wouldn’t be able to do it quickly. With Du Busi’s presence, Di Tian was going to be kept busy, and there was no better news than this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Du Busi, it’s you again! Since you’re courting death, I’ll fulfill your wish!” Di Tian’s furious roar echoed across the entire sky. The dark night sky suddenly turned purple. Even the green that Du Busi released couldn’t conceal this purple glow. All of Shrek City and the carcasses of soul beasts outside the city were dyed purple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huge purplish bubbles started to descend from the sky, each of them with a diameter of more than ten meters. They released thick purplish fog, and these bubbles engulfed the entire surface area of Shrek City together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside Shrek City, the soul beast army led by the four Savage Beasts quickly retreated. The soul beasts quieted down and ceased their furious roars. Every soul beast from the soul beast army seemed to have its mouth sealed, and didn’t dare to utter any sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Du Busi had just arrived. He initially thought that he could scare Di Tian slightly along with the rest of the strong soul masters from Shrek. He hadn’t expected the Beast God to make a move immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t understand why Di Tian was so furious, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Di Tian was sealed earlier, he could only sense that the soul beast army had suffered heavy losses, but he couldn’t completely tell what the extent of those losses was. Earlier, he had immediately used his spiritual sense to scan the entire area. When he saw the devastation and discovered that more than forty percent of his army had been killed, he was infuriated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like Elder Xuan and Elder Mu believed, this fight couldn’t be reversed anymore. Even if the beast wave retreated, this blood vengeance still had to be avenged!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian was naturally aware of Du Busi’s abilities. However, he was already extremely furious. No matter who came, he would still take action. He was willing to sacrifice everything to destroy Shrek!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Du Busi wore a serious look on his face. As he moved, he transformed into a hundred-meter tall giant in the air. Intense green lights shone from his body. Amidst these green lights, there was a subtle golden glow. From the looks of it, this giant was like a serious and solemn godly statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t dare to hold back against a strong opponent like Di Tian. The moment he appeared, he immediately activated the second awakening of his Body Soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He unleashed his terrifying fighting strength and mimicked a lifting action. Streaks of green light were released from his body as they attacked the purplish bubbles in the sky. Every streak of green light managed to accurately locate a purplish bubble. Similarly, the streaks of green light engulfed the entire place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Green and purple were clearly separated. However, Di Tian’s purplish bubbles seemed to overwhelm the green lights unleashed by Du Busi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Di Tian’s Black Dragon Annihilation, which was also his strongest area attack. He rarely used this soul skill. Every time he used this soul skill, he would lose some of his longevity. Even though he had already lived for more than eight hundred thousand years, his regard for his own life was still greater than other Savage Beasts. Right now, he used this soul skill because he was furious. This showed the extent of his hatred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Du Busi’s green lights weren’t weak, either. They were called Banquet of Death and were his eighth soul skill. Every streak of green light was filled with poison, and it was one of his strongest area attacks.</span></p>
