 <p><strong>Book 4: The Golden Road</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 27.3: Revenge? Brother?&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>Their opponents never expected Wang Dong to go all out the instant he made a move. More importantly, they’d never expected the strength of his Light of the Butterfly Goddess to be this terrifying.</p>
 <p>With the support of their Haodong Power, Wang Dong’s Light of the Butterfly Goddess was equivalent to a three-ringed Soul Elder using their thousand year soul skill at the very least. All that their opponents could do was release their soul skills at full power and defend against it.</p>
 <p>When the dazzling ray of light appeared, the two agility system soul masters were almost immediately blasted out of the arena. Although the assault system soul master was able to remain standing inside of the arena, his soul power had been almost entirely drained, and he’d suffered some minor injuries.</p>
 <p>Because of that, Wang Dong uttered an extremely domineering sentence after he’d unfurled his dazzling wings and landed, “Are you going to leave the arena by yourself, or do I need to assist you?”</p>
 <p>After that… there was no ‘after that’. This was the quickest match that had occurred since the tournament had begun. It was also this match that had caused Wang Dong’s popularity to soar, and made many people refer to him as the number one assault system soul master.</p>
 <p>After the match had ended, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong both rushed back to their dorms. In reality, even though Wang Dong had recovered his soul power, his overdrawing of it during the previous battle had caused him to suffer a few injuries, resulting in him being at a disadvantage in a drawn-out fight. However, only Huo Yuhao and him knew about this. That was why they’d chosen to end the match in such an explosive manner. If they’d met an opponent specialised in defense like Xie Huanyue was, the difficulty of the match would’ve increased exponentially—even if their opponent only had two rings.</p>
 <p>The second their match ended, Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong, and Xiao Xiao had already entered the top 4 of the tournament. In other words, they would definitely receive a prize if they won another match. If they managed to win two more matches, they’d be the champions of the tournament.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi had told them that this year’s batch of new students’ quality far exceeded that of the previous years. If they were able to become champions despite these circumstances, they’d undoubtedly have proven their potential.</p>
 <p>After they returned to their dorm room, Huo Yuhao didn’t set up his stall. Instead, he immediately began cultivating with Wang Dong. Without Xiao Xiao’s help, their following matches would only get tougher. Furthermore, they couldn’t use the same tactic a second time. Their explosive method of obtaining victory during their previous match had had an enormous element of surprise to it; now that their opponents were prepared for it, it’d be extremely difficult to pull off again. However, this was their best strategy to achieve victory with before Xiao Xiao returned.</p>
 <p>When morning arrived, both Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong simultaneously opened their eyes and separated their palms from one another. As the sun had just risen, Huo Yuhao stood up from his bed and opened the window in their room that faced east.</p>
 <p>A smidge of purple quietly appeared within the marble-white sky, causing Huo Yuhao’s eyes to instantly turn purple.</p>
 <p>After tidying his clothes up, Wang Dong went to clean himself up.</p>
 <p>Everything occurred in a natural manner. After breathing in some fresh air that had been let in by the window, a faint smile appeared on Huo Yuhao’s face.</p>
 <p><em>Mom, can you see me? Your son has already become a true soul master. I’ve even become a member of one of the top 4 teams in the freshmen assessment of the continent’s number one soul master academy. Don’t worry about me; I’ll definitely return to see you. Since you’ve suffered so many grievances, I’ll definitely let you have a grand funeral someday. I’ll make those who held you in contempt and bullied you pay.</em></p>
 <p>With that, a trace of hostility flashed through Huo Yuhao’s eyes, causing a layer of red to flare within his eyes before disappearing.</p>
 <p>He didn’t cultivate so diligently and devotedly just to become a peak-level expert or to become an expert amongst experts. He just wanted revenge—revenge for his mother. He’d never forgotten the humiliation he’d suffered during his youth. Although he’d received warmth from others, and had felt fraternal love between friends after entering Shrek Academy, he hadn’t forgotten the eleven years of pain he’d suffered. The memories from his childhood were already deeply ingrained in his mind.</p>
 <p>Yes, there would be a day when he returned to the place that had left a black mark on his childhood memories, as well as where his mother’s remains were.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s ambition was one that nobody would’ve ever thought of. However, the seeds of revenge had already sprouted in his heart.</p>
 <p>After the time needed to brew a cup of tea had passed, Wang Dong pushed the door open and re-entered their room. When he saw Huo Yuhao, who was still standing by the window, he couldn’t help but puzzledly ask, “Yuhao, are you okay?” In the past, Huo Yuhao would always be ready to go shower once he’d returned. However, he was still standing in front of the window today.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao hurriedly wiped the tears from the rims of his eyes and turned around, forcefully putting on a smile. “I’m fine, I was just thinking of my mother.”</p>
 <p>Regardless of it had been Tang Ya, Bei Bei, or Wang Dong, the only thing that Huo Yuhao had said about his parents was that they’d died, leaving him an orphan.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s gaze immediately turned soft. He walked towards Huo Yuhao and said, “Don’t feel sad. What’s happened has already happened. I’m sure that Aunty would want you to be happy, no? You’ve already had a completely new beginning in Shrek Academy, so leave those unhappy things in your past. Go take your shower quickly. We’ll cultivate a bit more once we’re done with breakfast. This is truly a perfect example of the phrase ,‘when it comes time to apply your knowledge, you find that you don’t have enough of it’! If I’d worked harder in the past, we wouldn’t be this worried now.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao chuckled, then grabbed his toiletries and left the room. Could one simply just forget their revenge? If one could just ‘forget’ revenge, what other force could prompt a mere eleven-year-old kid to travel across the lands and head towards the Great Star Dou Forest? What else could motivate a kid—whose talent was extremely bad—to the point that he was at now? However, even though revenge could be a driving force at times, there were times where it could also cloud one’s eyes.</p>
 <p>After showering, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong hurriedly ate their breakfasts, then cultivated until the sun had risen. After the sun had risen, they left their rooms and headed towards the Assessment Area. The champions of this year’s knock-out tournament would be decided today, and after getting all the way to the top 4, none of the teams would cower from the others.</p>
 <p>The number of spectators today was even greater than yesterday. All of the spectators were teachers, of course, as the students still had to continue their classes. The only difference was that the sloppy old man who’d appeared on the tall stage yesterday hadn’t turned up today.</p>
 <p>The top 4 teams stood together, waiting to draw lots. However, the person in charge of the lot-drawing today was no longer the Director of the outer courtyard’s Martial Soul Department, Du Weilun.</p>
 <p>A white-clothed old man had taken his position. When he saw this old man, Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but inwardly feel astonished; he’d previously seen this old man before, when he and Wang Dong had met the berserk Ma Xiaotao for the first time!</p>
 <p>At that time, this old man had been the person in charge of the teachers who’d rushed over from the Sea God’s Lake. As the freshmen assessment’s knock-out tournament had progressed to its final stage today, he’d finally shown up. This clearly showed his lofty position in the Academy. Even Director Du Weilun—who possessed an extremely high amount of authority in the Academy—respectfully stood beside him.</p>
 <p>“Greetings, youths. I’m Yan Shaozhe, the 261st Dean of Shrek Academy.” The white-clothed old man carried a smile on his face as he spoke. He had an extremely warm temperament, and made it seem as if he was only an ordinary old man.</p>
