 <p><strong>Book 11: The Continental Advanced Academy Soul Dueling Tournament</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 78.1: A Genius Food-type Soul Master?</strong></p>
 <p>“Cough, cough…” Xu Sanshi started to cough as he was almost choked by the smoke.</p>
 <p>He Caitou snorted and said, “I had specifically told everyone that I didn’t want to talk about it, but you guys still forced me too. Additionally, all of you said you wouldn’t laugh, but none of you kept your promise.”</p>
 <p>Everyone stopped laughing with great difficulty. They had laughed so hard that even their bellies had begun to hurt, especially Ma Xiaotao. At first, she thought that He Caitou was cursing her, but who would have thought that it was just his soul incantation.</p>
 <p>“He Caitou, tell me this! What category does your martial soul belong to?” Ma Xiaotao asked while trying to hold back her laughter. After asking her question, she couldn’t bear it anymore and started to laugh again.</p>
 <p>He Caitou was indignant and replied angrily, “You’re a senior student from the inner courtyard, and despite that, you don’t even know such basic information? Only food-type martial souls need a soul incantation to appear. Therefore, I’m a food-type soul master.”</p>
 <p>Just as He Caitou was explaining things, Xu Sanshi cried out in surprise. He took the thick cigar out of his mouth. Next, to everyone’s surprise, he brought it to his mouth again and took a deep breath, exhaling a mouthful of smoke afterward. The meeting room was immediately filled with the smell of tobacco.</p>
 <p>“This thing is not bad! My mind has become clearer after just smoking it twice, it feels really pleasant.</p>
 <p>The nearby Bei Bei laughed as he interjected, “Sure! Holding Caitou’s thick cigar in your mouth must surely feel good, right?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong, and Xiao Xiao weren’t too clear about the meaning of his remark, but everyone else burst out laughing. Xu Sanshi’s face immediately turned red and the nearby Jiang Nannan lowered her head; her face even redder than Xu Sanshi’s.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi stomped furiously towards Bei Bei and tried to push the cigar into his mouth, “Since you keep repeatedly talking about me, you should also get a taste of it before speaking!”</p>
 <p>But Bei Bei wasn’t planning to open his mouth even if the alternative was death and so, he struggled with all his might. As the two of them were evenly matched in strength Xu Sanshi had no way to pin him down.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan also stopped laughing with great difficulty and said, “Alright. Don’t be noisy. Caitou, what’re the effects of your food-type martial soul?”</p>
 <p>He Caitou snorted coldly and didn’t respond.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan laughed and said, “Fine. I promise that no one will laugh at you, but you can’t blame us either. Your soul incantation was just too strange, we couldn’t help but laugh! Anyway, you should tell us. It might be important when fighting our enemies tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>He Caitou replied somewhat unwillingly. “The one I used just now was my first soul skill. It’s called Mind Stimulating Thick Cigar. Each cigar can stay lit for around twenty minutes. When smoked, it will strengthen both the user’s mind and spiritual power. This type of soul skill is rather fitting for someone like Yuhao. If he smokes the cigar, I can assure that his spiritual-type soul skills will experience an amplification of at least 10%.”</p>
 <p>After hearing his explanation, all the smiling people in the room looked at each other in dismay. Their smiling expressions disappeared and were slowly replaced with shock.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan was the most surprised. “It can strengthen spiritual-type soul skills? And it can amplify his skills by at least 10%?”</p>
 <p>He Caitou nodded and said, “Yes. Isn’t it quite normal for food-type soul masters? However, in the end, we are not as good as auxiliary-type soul masters. I’ve heard that there is a member of the Nine Treasures Clan in the second year whose soul skills have an astonishing level of amplification.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan said, “Granted, but she needs to continuously consume soul power to maintain the effect. On the other hand, you don’t have to expend any additional soul power after creating the cigar. And on top of that, food-type soul skills require the least amount of soul power. As if that wasn’t enough, won’t your soul skill also get stronger as your cultivation progresses?”</p>
 <p>He Caitou thought about it for a bit and said, “That’s true. My consumption of soul power isn’t high. However, since I usually use most of my soul power on soul tools, I have never paid much attention to this useless amplification skill. The main use of my soul rings is to increase the rank of my soul power, and between my four soul skills, the only one I use regularly is the first one. And that’s only because it has the ability to increase my accuracy when using soul tools. Since the other three aren’t of any use to me, all I have is a vague idea about their effects.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan looked at the crowd and asked in a grave tone, “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”</p>
 <p>Dai Yueheng replied, “It seems the Martial Soul Department has missed out on a very talented food-type soul master.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan nodded in agreement. “Exactly”</p>
 <p>“Ah?” He Caitou was bewildered, “Are you talking about me?”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan smiled bitterly, “Who else could we be talking about? Caitou, you’re aware that there was a food-type soul master among the first generation of Shrek’s Seven Monsters, right? His martial soul was a sausage, and now that I think about it, he was similar to you in many ways. His soul incantation was also very funny. But in the end, he still managed to become a powerhouse and marry the successor of the Nine Treasures Clan. At that time, he also strengthened Ancestor Rong Rong’s Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda and turned it into the Nine Treasures Glazed Pagoda. You have to understand that food-type soul masters are in no way useless. If we consider Bei Bei as the leader of the group, and Huo Yuhao as its future brain, then you are the crucial backbone of the team with your food-type martial soul.”</p>
 <p>He Caitou looked at Wang Yan in disbelief. Up till now, he had believed that his martial soul was completely useless aside from the times he was practicing. Even Fan Yu didn’t pay too much attention to his martial soul once he discovered that it was a food-type one and only trained him in the field of soul tools. In addition, that soul incantation was quite weird and was prone to causing misunderstandings. Therefore, he didn’t use his martial skills too much. Today, or rather, now that Wang Yan had revealed the mystery of his martial skills, he discovered that even he could become a powerful soul master.</p>
 <p>At this moment, He Caitou had the feeling that the Heavens were laughing at him. His brain went blank, and he didn’t know what to say.</p>
 <p>“No need to doubt your own abilities,” Wang Yan said, “Once I’m done explaining things, everything will become clear. Do you know which type of soul master is the most demanded by an army? It’s precisely a food-type soul master. What you’ve heard is correct. It’s not the assault-type, defense-type, agility-type, control-type, nor the auxiliary-type, but it’s the rarely seen and harmless food-type soul master.”</p>
 <p>“Why?” Wang Yan asked rhetorically, then answered his own question. “That’s because a food-type soul master can act as backline support for an army, and can even increase the overall strength of the troops. If you’re a battle soul master, the army can either look at you and act as spectators, or work as cannon fodder. But if you’re a food-type tool soul master, you can integrate with the soldiers. For example, this thick cigar can increase spiritual power by 10%. If we compare it to an auxiliary-type soul skill, it is indeed not worth mentioning. However, you’re considered a talent amongst talents if we're talking about food-type soul masters!”</p>
 <p>“I-I don’t understand,” He Caitou replied, startled.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan said, “Let me ask you this. Given sufficient time, how many cigars can you create with your current level of soul power?”</p>
 <p>He Caitou replied, “A lot of them. At the very least a thousand, I think. However, if they are not used within two days, these cigars will expire and won’t have any effect.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan’s eyebrows shot up. “Two days? You’re saying that the cigars created by your soul skill can last for two days before going bad?”</p>
 <p>He Caitou replied as if it were obvious, “Yes! However, if we compare them to normal cigars, they expire really quickly.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan howled angrily after a moment of reflection, “Quick, your ass! Do you know that usually, the things produced by other food-type soul masters can only last for a few hours? A preservation time of more than three hours is already considered a major feat. If it can last for 12 hours, the soul master can be considered a genius. And you, who can preserve his creations for a whole 48 hours, are speaking of it as if it were something completely ordinary?! If we make full use of your abilities, your soul skill could allow an army of a thousand soldiers to increase their strength with your cigars over a period of several hours. Do you understand? And when it comes to your teammates, you can definitely provide them with one or more sets of cigars before every battle. When they smoke them during the battle, they’ll receive a boost from your skill. However, you would have already recovered the soul power used to create the cigar long before the match. In other words, it’ll be as though there was an additional soul master on our team.”</p>
 <p>He Caitou scratched his head and said, “Is it really that impressive? The effects of my other soul skills might be even better.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan slammed the table and got up. “What are you waiting for? Quickly, tell us about your other three soul skills. Let’s see what bomb you’re going to drop this time.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Wang Yan felt his heartbeat speed up. All this time, he had thought that the biggest shortcoming of this team was the lack of an auxiliary-type soul master. Without an auxiliary-type soul master, the team wouldn’t have an opportunity to explosively increase its overall power during a match. And never would he have expected that a super talented food-type soul master like He Caitou would be hidden in plain sight. How could he remain calm after such a revelation?</p>
 <p>Wang Yan’s previous explanation had only mentioned some of the advantages of having a food-type soul master. Although auxiliary-type soul masters could amplify abilities to a larger degree, the amplification wouldn’t last for too long. For a long drawn out team battle, a food-type soul master would surely be more useful than an auxiliary-type one. Despite the auxiliary-type soul master’s short-term advantage, among tool soul masters, both of them had their strong points.</p>
 <p>“This daddy has a large cigar!”</p>
 <p>“This daddy has a long cigar!”</p>
 <p>“This daddy has a thin cigar!”</p>
 <p>Amidst everyone’s violently twitching faces, He Caitou activated all three of his soul skills, causing three cigars to immediately appear in his hand. The form and the color were the same as the first cigar. However, all of them differed in size.</p>
