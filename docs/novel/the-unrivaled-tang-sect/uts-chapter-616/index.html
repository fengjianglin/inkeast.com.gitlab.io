 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very few in the Sun Moon Empire knew that Xu Yunhan had tagged along with them. The reason why Ju Zi brought him with her was because she couldn’t leave him alone in the empire. After all, she had left with the strongest fighting force in the empire. Furthermore, something had happened to her son before. She was afraid of a repeat of the incident, which prompted her to bring him along with her. In her opinion, he was very safe with such a powerful soul engineer legion led by Elder Kong personally. However, who knew that the situation would be like this now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stunned for a moment after listening to Xu Yunhan’s words. He couldn’t help but think of the time when he first met him. He lowered his head and saw the beautiful, black short hair that Xu Yunhan had. His big black eyes were very bright, and his skin was just like his mother’s – very smooth and delicate. He looked elegant in his outfit. The smile on his face was even more captivating. He was only six or seven, but he was not frantic at all. Rather, he was curious as he lifted his head to look at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could Huo Yuhao really lay his hands on this kid? It was a certain no. It was impossible. However, he had no choice after being forced by Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi shuddered as she screamed, “Huo Yuhao, you must not touch Yunhan!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took a deep breath and calmed himself down. “Then agree to my conditions. Leave with your people and return to the Sun Moon Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s eyes flashed and she gritted her teeth. She was already a little speechless as she looked at Huo Yuhao. Revenge had been her life’s goal. However, there were only two important people in her life. One was this man, who had disappeared for three years. The other was the little kid in his arms!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was still less important. After all, she didn’t belong to him. However, Xu Yunhan was her only son. He was her only reason to live. Ju Zi didn’t even dare to imagine what would happen if something happened to him. Perhaps she would really use the blood of the continent to pay respects to her son.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though she knew that Huo Yuhao had always been very soft-hearted and wouldn’t do anything to her son, she didn’t dare to take the gamble. It was too scary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why? Why must you protect the White Tiger Duke? Why don’t you let me kill him? You should know that it’s better for my empire to rule the continent compared to what’s going on now. I’m no longer the one who can make the decision anymore. Even if you threaten me, I… I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi could not carry on any further as she spoke until this point. This was because she was terrified to see Huo Yuhao caressing her son’s head. Given his abilities, he just needed an instant to kill him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, Yuhao, don’t do it! Don’t harm Yunhan.” Ju Zi begged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming was already very grim now. Xu Yunhan wasn’t just the Emperor. He was also his disciple. Although he was only six, his potential was already recognized and well-loved by Kong Deming. He believed that he could nurture a great Emperor for the empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that he was in the enemy’s hands, the circumstances had changed completely. Moreover, the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion had been wiped out. It was a complete turnaround!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s abilities were simply too terrifying. No one from the Sun Moon Empire could fight him. Under this circumstance, no one could possibly save Xu Yunhan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening to Ju Zi’s words, Huo Yuhao turned his head to look at the White Tiger Duke. The White Tiger Duke was also staring back at him. He revealed a gentle gaze in his eyes, whereas Huo Yuhao appeared very conflicted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know why I’m protecting him? Why won’t I let you kill him? I’ll tell you in front of everyone.” Huo Yuhao took in a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yunhan was very obedient in his arms. He didn’t struggle at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because!” Huo Yuhao turned around again and glared at Ju Zi. “He is my biological father!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he said this, it was like a bomb that was dropped on two people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he wasn’t very loud, it was very clear in every part of the battlefield because of the conduction of his immense spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the city walls, Dai Yueheng, Dai Huabin and Dai Luoli were all jolted awake. They also heard everything Huo Yuhao said. Apart from Dai Luoli, Dai Yueheng and Dai Huabin were both stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially so for Dai Huabin. Ever since he had entered Shrek Academy, he had been chasing and challenging one person. No matter what, he wouldn’t have expected this. He didn’t expect Huo Yuhao to be his brother. In terms of age, Huo Yuhao should be his younger brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was in a daze. She looked at Huo Yuhao, and her mouth was already subconsciously wide open. There were many thoughts in her mind, but she didn’t expect this to be the case. How could this be the case? The White Tiger Duke, the person she hated to the core, was actually Huo Yuhao’s father. Didn’t that mean that Dai Hao was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi felt as if cold water had been poured on her head when she developed this thought. She staggered in the air and almost couldn’t control her body. She fell just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was equally as astonished as he drifted to Huo Yuhao’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What, what are you talking about?” The White Tiger Duke’s voice had completely changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his heart, this young man was one of the most powerful individuals in the younger generation of soul masters. He was the most outstanding person in Shrek. Because of him, the Star Luo Empire had managed to avert a few disasters.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did, did he actually mention that he’s my son?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right! You are my father.” Huo Yuhao turned to look at Dai Hao. He was no longer calm, and his voice was shaking a little. Due to his emotional undulations, an indescribable sense of sorrow also influenced everyone around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, you are also my enemy at the same time!” Huo Yuhao was already very pale when he said this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke’s voice cracked as he asked, “No, this is impossible. How could you possibly be my son?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took in a deep breath and tried to suppress his emotions. “In that case, let me remind you that my mom’s surname is Huo. You should recognize that.” As he spoke, Huo Yuhao lifted his hand and retrieved a dagger from his storage-type soul tool before passing it to the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is a gift of love that you gave my mom. I hope you haven’t forgotten.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke paused for a moment. He was fixated on the White Tiger Dagger in Huo Yuhao’s hand. He took it subconsciously, but his hands were shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You, you’re Yun’er’s kid. Yun’er, she actually bore me a child. Didn’t she die of sickness when I went out for an expedition? How, how did this happen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The person who told you about my mom’s death must be your wife,” Huo Yuhao said coldly, “in your heart, my mom must have had died some twenty-odd years ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dai Hao was in a daze as he looked at the dagger. “I was busy with war. I couldn’t return even after learning Yun’er was dead. Things were very tense at the front line. I didn’t return to the Duke’s Mansion for ten years. When I returned, she was already in ashes. The only thing I could do was refurbish her tomb. You, you’re actually Yun’er’s son. You shouldn’t be called Huo Yuhao then. You should be called Dai Yuhao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head with force and raged, “No, I’m not Dai Hao. I’m Huo Yuhao. I’m only Huo Yuhao. I’m my mother’s son, not your son. Have you taken care of me for a single day? Did you even know I existed? When I was young, I had to watch you from afar. You even returned then, but why didn’t you go and see my mom? Why did you let your wife bully her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I returned? Every time I did so, I had to leave hastily. Things were simply too hectic in the military. Yes, I neglected Yun’er.” Dai Hao turned pale. Even when he faced Ju Zi’s sword, he didn’t look as lost as he was right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned his head suddenly and tried to hold back his tears. “After we deal with this matter, I will get back everything you owe my mother from the Duke’s Mansion, you and your wife.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Huo Yuhao turned to Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you understand? You should! No matter how much I’m unwilling to admit it, his blood flows in me. Although he harmed my mother, he’s still a hero of the Star Luo Empire. I’m not ashamed because his blood flows in me. No matter what, I won’t let him die by your hands. Now you should understand why I’m protecting him, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finally vented everything he had kept in his heart for so many years, Huo Yuhao felt relieved. Everything was about to be over. After he defeated the Sun Moon Empire’s army, he would return to the Duke’s Mansion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was close to Huo Yuhao, and grabbed onto his arm. She grabbed his arm and used the warmth of her palms to comfort him. She was the only one who wasn’t astonished by his words. This was because she already knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He still deeply recalled the vow he had made before he left the Duke’s Mansion more than ten years ago. If not for that vow, he wouldn’t have trained so tirelessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although his hatred had diminished, he still believed he needed to deal with his mother’s matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bitter look surfaced on Ju Zi’s face. “I didn’t expect this. I really didn’t expect this. You are actually his son. Yuhao, I have to thank you. You are right, I really shouldn’t kill him. No matter how much I hate him, I can’t kill him. Return my son to me. Return Yunhan to me. I’ll promise you anything. I’ll pull the army back. We’ll return the land we’ve taken from the Star Luo Empire to them. However, both the Heavenly Soul and Dou Ling Empires have long been occupied. We can’t return them. They are already more than half the Sun Moon Empire’s land. I have no right to return them. What I can do is to return the Star Luo Empire. It’s already the most I can do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was slightly shocked when he heard Ju Zi’s words. It was already a surprise that the Sun Moon Empire was willing to return their territories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Dou Ling and Heavenly Soul Empires, their royal families were completely powerless. Even if their empires were returned to them, they were no longer capable of running them. Undoubtedly, this was the best that could be achieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After pondering for a moment, Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Alright, we’ll follow your idea. Retreat with your army and leave the Star Luo Empire. However, since you betrayed our promise, I’ll need you to pay for it a hundred times more. Within the next thousand years, the Sun Moon Empire must not invade the Star Luo Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi sighed, “Alright, I can promise that. However, we’ll counterattack if the Star Luo Empire attacks us. Return my child to me. We’ll leave immediately.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She finally compromised. It had to do with Elder Kong. This was their bottom line that Elder Kong had suggested to her. As Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were simply too strong and there were stationary interference shells, the entire Sun Moon Empire army might actually be wiped out if Huo Yuhao decided to attack! They could only leave this place first before finding a way to invent a soul tool strong enough to deal with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Leave first. As for Yunhan, I’ll take care of him. You’ve already betrayed your promise once. How do you expect me to trust you again? After ten years, I’ll return him to you as long as the Sun Moon Empire remains obedient.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Ju Zi exclaimed. “You’re going to take Yunhan away for ten years? No, impossible. Impossible!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing that Huo Yuhao wanted to leave with Xu Yunhan, Ju Zi panicked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao dealt with this in a composed manner. “You betrayed our trust and started a war. We can’t trust you anymore. Xu Yunhan will follow me for the next ten years, and we’ll see what happens next. You can leave now.”</span></p>
