 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh, what’s this?” Long Xiaoyao was still standing there, motionless, and he grinned as he allowed those two beams of light to land on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There weren’t any soul power undulations, nor were there spiritual undulations. The black and white beams didn’t seem to do anything at all. However, Long Xiaoyao’s expression changed a little when they actually landed on him, and an inexplicable sense of danger immediately appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I can feel danger?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Spiritual... Shock!” a voice with a strange tone rang out, and every syllable uttered made the enormous vertical eye a little brighter. He could see that all the rose-gold light that the vertical eye was radiating had turned blood-red at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A pillar of light that was the same size as the vertical eye blasted out in the next moment and went right for Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao snorted as his body, which was originally submerged within all the rose-gold colors, suddenly turned black, and a dragon roar that seemed to come from ages past arose. An enormous black dragon head appeared in front of him, howling at all the rose-gold light around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual power against spiritual power – this was the arrogance that belonged to an Ultimate Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Long Xiaoyao wasn’t a spiritual-type soul master, his mastery of spiritual power had already reached the limits of terrifying because he was an Ultimate Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, something that astonished the Dragon Emperor Douluo once more happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rose-gold pillar of light that seemed unstoppable as it zipped through the air suddenly paused – yes, it paused – and a shadow suddenly appeared in front of it. It was Huo Yuhao, who was back in human form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A rose-gold wheel of light glowed behind his head. There were patterns of a Three-Eyed Golden Lion within this wheel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body slammed almost directly into the giant black dragon head, and he was immediately consumed by the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything happened too suddenly, and Long Xiaoyao was momentarily stunned. Afterwards, he looked on in surprise as the black dragon head that he had conjured with his spiritual power dissipated just like that. The figure of Huo Yuhao was still hovering in midair, the rose-gold pillar was reactivated, and enveloped that shadow before it wrapped around him and slammed brutally into Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rose-gold pillar’s origin, the vertical eye, disappeared in that moment, and a large black door filled with eerie and sinister auras took its place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s face was very pale as he stood at the gate’s entrance. He was holding Tang Wutong with one of his hands, and her Radiant Dragon Butterfly’s wings were outstretched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go!” Huo Yuhao dashed into the door as he pulled Tang Wutong along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There would only be one outcome battling an Ultimate Douluo, and that was death and defeat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Huo Yuhao had never considered fighting against the Dragon Emperor Douluo from the beginning. What he needed was an opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Destiny’s Judgment from the Eye of the Asura was the first step to creating this chance. Bad luck appearing on his opponent was equivalent to good luck standing on his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black and white lights crossed. Those were the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s two powerful soul skills conferred by his sixth soul ring, Spiritual Dispossession and Destiny’s Demise. They instantly lowered his opponent’s defense against both material and spiritual attacks. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Huo Yuhao didn’t know what kind of effect these two powerful soul skills could achieve against an Ultimate Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What came next was his most powerful spiritual attack, the Eye of the Asura’s Spiritual Shock! The rose-gold colors were blood-red when he was using his full strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could only get closer to an Ultimate Douluo with spiritual attacks. He had actually paid an enormous price for that momentary pause in the middle, and cracks even appeared in his spiritual sea in that moment because of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was that momentary pause that allowed him to dispel the Eye of the Asura, and use Instant Teleportation to appear in front of his own Spiritual Shock. What he leveraged was the Dragon Emperor Douluo’s arrogance, betting that the Dragon Emperor Douluo would use spiritual power to fight against his own Spiritual Shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was successful in his wager. He used his body to take a hit from the Dragon Emperor Douluo’s attack, and he used the soul skill that came from the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s skull, Destiny’s Adjudication. That soul skill gave him immunity to spiritual attacks thrice a day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao managed to escape from the Evileye Tyrant King’s assault once because of this soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His chances were boosted once more!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black door appeared because Huo Yuhao was already making his incantations when he became the Eye of the Asura. He relied on his spiritual soul core to do two things at the same time, and his body was enormously burdened as he completed the summoning of his spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Huo Yuhao needed was the last step in creating this opportunity. He made another bet, that his strongest form of Spiritual Shock could cause the Dragon Emperor Douluo to be momentarily stunned after taking a hit from Spiritual Dispossession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If every chance came through in the end, then he had a chance to take Tang Wutong into the spectral demiplane and escape from this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Eye of the Asura, Destiny’s Judgment, Spiritual Dispossession, Destiny’s Demise, Spiritual Shock, Instant Teleportation, Destiny’s Adjudication, and the opening of his spectral demiplane.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao used eight soul skills one after another within such a short period of time, and he did all that so he could create a chance for him and Tang Wutong to run away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did he succeed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Darkness was starting to descend upon them as Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s bodies were about to disappear into that large door which connected them to the spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything in the world seemed to freeze in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An elderly voice suddenly resonated through the air, which was already frozen and swallowed by darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Almost. You really almost succeeded.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gigantic black dragon claw flickered with dark purple light as it slashed out across this dark space, right at the black door that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had just escaped into.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The large black door immediately broke apart as two bodies that were about to disappear suddenly became clear once more. They were forcibly pulled from the darkness surrounding them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silent darkness vanished as Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong collapsed onto the ground almost at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s eyes were full of fear as she helped Huo Yuhao back on his feet, as he was faltering and about to fall back to the ground. Her expression became increasingly solemn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Darkness Holy Dragon, the Dragon Emperor Douluo, reappeared within their vision amid the darkness, but he was no longer smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes were concentrated on Huo Yuhao, and there were unexplainable emotions rippling through his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now, I must admit that you are much more talented and accomplished than I was when I was younger,” Long Xiaoyao spoke sincerely. “With your current spiritual power, and the fact that you already possess a soul core for your spiritual-type martial soul before your eighth soul ring, you will have a chance to challenge me when you become a Transcendent Douluo in the future. If, one day, you can become an Ultimate Douluo, then you will be on the same level as the Beast God and the Evil Emperor. If not for my Silent Darkness Domain, you would have successfully escaped, and this episode would have probably become the greatest joke of my later days.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao struggled free from Tang Wutong’s support. He wiped away the blood that was coming from his nose as he said coldly, “We weren’t able to escape in the end, were we?” His nose was bleeding not because the Darkness Holy Dragon had hurt him. Instead, it was because he had paid a huge price to unleash eight powerful soul skills with his full strength, one after another. Every single soul skill was unleashed at its greatest possible level, and even his spiritual sea had begun to crack. His head was exploding with pain, and it was impossible for him to use spiritual attacks like he had before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But we haven’t lost. We will never lose in any moment before we die.” Tang Wutong took a step forward from behind Huo Yuhao and stood in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was momentarily stunned. Tang Wutong snapped her head around and glanced at him. “Why aren’t you willing to trust me? If we had combined our abilities back then, we might have succeeded. You have too much machismo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt a little dazed in that instant when he saw her displeased expression. A thought suddenly surfaced in his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If only she had been Dong’er. If I had teamed up with Dong’er, our plan would have succeeded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now, it’s my turn!” Tang Wutong grunted coldly as she raced forward like a gust of wind. She was pretty, and she was aloof, and she seemed like the Goddess of Light lighting up the darkness around them in this moment. She had the determination of a moth pouncing towards fire, and an unwavering resolution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her pinkish-blue hair swayed in the air like waves as she continued charging forward. Crisp dragon roars could be heard as brilliant golden flames blazed behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smile appeared on Long Xiaoyao’s face once more as he stared at the determination and arrogance on Tang Wutong’s face. He gradually raised his right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at that moment, Tang Wutong suddenly paused in midair as all seven of her soul rings shone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her soul rings were also different from normal soul masters. Black, black, black, black, black, black, red! She had six black rings and one red ring, six ten thousand year soul rings and a single hundred thousand year soul ring. It meant she had potential and talent that wasn’t inferior to Huo Yuhao at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One reason why Bei Bei went to look for Tang Wutong and sent her to ask Huo Yuhao to return, besides the fact that she looked just like Dong’er, was because Bei Bei hoped that she could pull Huo Yuhao slowly walk out from his thoughts and memories of Dong’er. But there was yet another more important reason, and that was because she was sufficiently powerful. She had seven powerful soul rings that made her much more powerful than a typical Soul Sage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her seven soul rings flickered as the radiance from her body flourished. The light pattern of a trident appeared on her forehead, and a tinge of blue immediately covered her otherwise golden frame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong raised her head a little amid the bluish-gold colors. She allowed her flowing long hair to drift and sway in the wind, and a bright dragon roar rang out from her mouth. This dragon roar was crisp and bright, and along with the intense bluish-golden light, an enormous dragon-shaped shadow gradually appeared with her body in the middle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was a colossal dragon flickering with the colors of the rainbow. The dragon seemed illusory, but there was a dignity and majesty within the illusion that seemed like it could dominate the ages.</span></p>
