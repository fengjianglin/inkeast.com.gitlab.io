 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

I don’t think I’ll die even if I leave your spiritual sea now. Electrolux’s ritual is truly miraculous, and it’s made certain transformations to both the Ice Empress and me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Transformations?” Huo Yuhao stared at him with a confused look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Skydream chided him, “Have you grown stupid? Spirits! Are you trying to say that both the Ice Empress and I are not fusing our strengths and our spiritual imprints with you willingly? The truth is that we completed the spirit seal that day too. However, we are different from the Snow Empress in a way that our process was even more successful. The reason is because we fused together a long time ago, and we were already a part of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes widened and his jaw grew slack. “Brother Skydream, are you saying that you’ve also become my spirit? Does that mean you can leave my body to fight?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Skydream chortled and said, “I’m not very good at fighting, although I do can take a stroll outside. I’m not entirely your spirit yet, and I will only become one after a certain degree of conversion. Fortunately, I was smart enough back then to let you absorb Imitation. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to release your martial soul when I fully convert into your spirit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A thought crossed Huo Yuhao’s mind and he said, “Is that because the soul ring you attached to my body will be different from normal situations after you change into a million-year spirit?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Skydream nodded and said, “I don’t have a soul ring for you, as my soul ring has long become part of your body. However, once I change to a spirit, the soul ring will also change to a certain extent. It will be different from the Snow Empress’ spirit. There’s no way for me to tell what it will look like, but you’ll find out when it happens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “What else needs to be done before you can change into a Spirit? Do you want to become a spirit, Skydream? Please don’t force yourself if you don’t want that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The human face that Skydream had conjured made an annoyed look as he said, “Of course I do, you idiot! I will never be able to go outside if I remain like this, and I can only stay inside you. I can finally get out of here when I become a spirit. My memories and my intelligence were preserved during that ritual back then. I am extremely willing to become a spirit! Nothing much will happen to you when I become a spirit, because I’m not that adept with fighting in the first place. The most I can do is help you use some of the abilities that I have given you when necessary. The ritual is simple, all you have to do is sign the pact and it will be done.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed and said, “I won’t be so courteous anymore, then. However, teacher mentioned before that I can’t assimilate too many spirits, as it will consume too much of my spiritual power. You won’t suck me dry, will you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Skydream replied angrily, “Why did I choose a fool like you all those years ago? I’ve already said that the ritual has been completed, and all that’s left is the pact! Everything that needs to be absorbed has already been absorbed! Furthermore, my situation and the Ice Empress’ situation is different from the Snow Empress, as we were the first to have fused with you. This is the reason why we completed the fusion long ago, and we have provided our own spiritual power to integrate into your own, so we don’t need your spiritual power anymore. Otherwise, we would have separated your spirit into pieces when you fused with the Snow Empress back then. Quickly now, give me that pact, so I can go outside and roam the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wouldn’t reject Skydream’s request, and immediately began to chant the Pact Sealing Spell that Electrolux had imparted to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s torrential and tumultuous spiritual sea gradually began to calm during his incantation. Skydream said no more, and just levitated silently in midair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes slowly turned golden as he raised his right hand, and drew runes in the sky continuously that drifted towards Skydream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Skydream gradually closed his eyes. His enormous frame became a little smaller with every rune that landed on his body. Gentle spiritual power circulated through his body, and his aura was slowly undergoing mystical transformations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s senses were the most acute, and the first thing he felt was separation. Skydream was being converted to his vassal spirit, and that meant Skydream was separating himself from his own spiritual origin. It also meant that Skydream was officially leaving his spiritual origin to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm’s virtual body was growing smaller, but it was also becoming more material, and his life energy was becoming increasingly dense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm’s two supreme treasures were his spiritual origin that he had bestowed upon Huo Yuhao, and his life origin imprint formed by a million years’ worth of life energy. At this moment, his life origin imprint seemed like it was being awakened as the pact took effect. He continually released immense amounts of life energy, which continuously fused with Huo Yuhao. The ripples gradually made Skydream’s body even more solid and material.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao finally released the final rune successfully, and the pact was complete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Skydream’s frame had become small enough to fit on a palm, and he suddenly soared into the sky as a white streak of light. His tiny golden eyes were filled with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a golden imprint on his forehead, looking just like a vertical eye. It was the pact that bound him to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like Skydream had said before, there was a huge rift between completing the process with the Snow Empress back then and completing the process with Skydream at this moment. Huo Yuhao didn’t feel any abnormal undulations in his spiritual power or his soul power; the pact was already completed. Skydream had officially become Huo Yuhao’s spirit from this moment onwards...Huo Yuhao’s second spirit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Skydream’s body flashed and disappeared within Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea just like that. Huo Yuhao’s consciousness returned to his physical body, and he subconsciously opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

Wang Dong’er was gone, and Huo Yuhao was the only person left in the room. The chair that Wang Dong’er had sat on while she was watching over him was still beside his bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er had left when the sky turned dark. Huo Yuhao had still been asleep, but his vitals had returned to normal, and everything seemed fine. Wang Dong’er didn’t know how to face him when he woke up, so she chose to run away from this problem. From her perspective, everything might be different when she woke up the next morning, or everyone would just forget about what had happened before. Perhaps Huo Yuhao would give her a reasonable explanation. Despondence and grief was exhausting, and Wang Dong’er had fallen into a deep sleep once she returned to her room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Skydream!” Huo Yuhao swiftly sat up on his bed and called out softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, you can’t find me, you can’t find me!” Skydream’s voice rang out in Huo Yuhao’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chortled and said, “Have you forgotten the Spiritual Detection you gave me?” He activated Spiritual Detection at once and surveyed the entire room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re cheating!” Skydream’s exasperated and unconvinced voice could be heard once more. Huo Yuhao finally found him using Spiritual Detection – Skydream was on his body, but hidden in the folds of his clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He lifted Skydream from the folds of his clothes. Huo Yuhao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he saw the Skydream Iceworm’s appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Skydream was like an absolute miniature version of his former body. He was a bit over six inches long, and only as thick as a pinkie finger. His entire body was translucent, like white jade, and his subtle movements gave off a faint aroma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Skydream’s frame was extremely tiny, but the life energy that he released gave Huo Yuhao the feeling that he had obtained another piece of Life Gold. Skydream’s tiny golden eyes were like yellow diamonds in the night sky as they sparkled brilliantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Skydream, why do I feel like your spirit is different from the Snow Empress’ spirit?” Huo Yuhao asked doubtfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm answered proudly, “Of course it is. Don’t forget, I’m a million year soul beast, and I fused with your body a long time ago. I have retained my intelligence in its entirety, and I am now an independent entity, while I do not need to absorb your strength to maintain myself anymore. Come, come, come!” His tiny frame started wiggling in Huo Yuhao’s palm as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao looked on in shock as a streak of light emerged from his storage-type soul tool and rushed in Skydream’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao would have forgotten about it if Skydream hadn’t drawn it out. Wasn’t this the layer of skin that Skydream had shed after they fused inside the Great Star Dou Forest back in the day? They had relied on this skin to restrain the Ice Empress before they convinced her to fuse with him.</span></p>

The skin slowly plastered to and fused with Skydream’s body.</span></p>

His eyes were filled with incredulity; Skydream was almost undergoing a reincarnation, and that meant that the life origin imprint that he had integrated into Huo Yuhao’s body all those years ago was being extracted to fuse with Skydream’s shed skin and form a brand-new Skydream Iceworm. Skydream was making himself a brand-new body, and would be able to survive independently even if he didn’t return to Huo Yuhao’s body. He could even survive easily in a place far away from Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

You’re creating life, brother Skydream!” Huo Yuhao exclaimed with wide eyes and a slack jaw.</span></p>
