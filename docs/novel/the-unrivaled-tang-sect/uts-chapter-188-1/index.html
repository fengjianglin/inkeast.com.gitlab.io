 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

The dry and cool smell from the blanket being basked in the sun helped him relax. He took a deep breath, and he felt as if he could smell a scent that belonged uniquely to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Silly boy. We aren’t that young anymore, I will definitely help you relax. However, do you know what it means for me to take you back home?” he muttered under his breath, and couldn’t help but blush. Fortunately, the sky was dark and helped him cover up, so it wasn’t so obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took a little longer than Wang Dong in the shower. When he came out from the bathroom with a clean body and mind, he realized that Wang Dong had already fallen asleep.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s sleeping so soundly. He must have been tired after journeying for the entire day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He pulled up Wang Dong’s blanket gently and laid back on his own mattress. He placed his hands behind his head, and suddenly realized that quietly listening to Wang Dong’s rhythmic breathing was actually very relaxing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He recalled something that Xuan Ziwen had remarked about him some time ago: “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Daydreaming must be the most luxurious thing for you on normal days, eh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes! Daydreaming was a form of luxury for him. If not for Wang Dong’s arrival, how could he just be laying here and listening to Wang Dong’s breathing? Huo Yuhao suddenly realized that he seemed to have fallen in love with this peace and tranquility.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He unknowingly drifted into dreamland while he counted Wang Dong’s breaths. The corner of his mouth was curled upwards, and there was a faint smile on his face from beginning to end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One was sleeping on the bed, while the other was sleeping on the floor. These two youths had the same calm and balanced breathing, and all this became the night’s rhythm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was still fast asleep when he suddenly felt something press down on his back. He shifted subconsciously, and the pressure on his back moved along with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He opened his eyes in a daze before he discovered, to his surprise, that sunlight was already flooding the entire room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh? What time is it?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was still lying on the mattress as he forced out a smile and said, “All I know is that if you continue sitting on my back, my shit is going to be squeezed out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tch, you’re so disgusting. I wouldn’t sit on others even if they wanted me to.” Wang Dong stood up proudly to hide his embarrassment and went into the bathroom to wash up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao reached behind and stroked his back as he muttered under his breath, “His butt is quite big. It didn’t feel so frightening when he sat on me.” He leapt off the mattress and suddenly realized that his brain was a little dizzy. He bathed himself in the sunlight that poured in through the window, and his entire body just felt so lazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This must be what it feels like to relax</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">.</span></p>

His blanket wasn’t folded up yet and there was a fragrant and crisp smell emanating from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ugh. If only I could sleep like this and wake up naturally every day. Oh, wait, I was woken up by someone sitting on my back.” Huo Yuhao mumbled to himself, and he couldn’t help but laugh at his own words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They bathed in succession and ate a meal that wasn’t really breakfast or lunch, before they leisurely sauntered out of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nobody could really stop Huo Yuhao if he wanted to leave. Furthermore, Jing Hongchen didn’t suspect him much – he only walked between the laboratory and the dormitory every day, he never strolled around the place, and he never really asked much of his teachers, either. What was there to doubt and suspect from his orderly behavior?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them proceeded out into the city once they left the academy. Wang Dong heaved a sigh of admiration as they walked and said, “I have to say the Sun Moon Empire’s Radiant City is magnificent and wonderfully constructed. This Radiant City is quite unlike any other country I have seen. Soul tools are already pervasive among their citizens!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “This is the Sun Moon Empire’s advantage, and it’s also because they have many precious minerals. Has eldest senior brother received the rare metals that I sent back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong nodded. “We have given half to the academy and kept the remaining half for the Tang Sect, according to your instructions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “That’s good. Oh, yes, I haven’t asked you yet – where exactly is your home? We have known each other for so long, but I have never heard you bring up anything about your home. You only bring up your sister from time to time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong grinned mysteriously and said, “My home is hidden away in the clouds. You’ll know when you reach it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hidden away in the clouds?” Huo Yuhao repeated, amused. “Are you trying to be mysterious?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Radiant City was big, but the two of them chatted happily and didn’t really feel the passage of time. They finally left the Radiant City, and Huo Yuhao suddenly stopped in his tracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go!” Wang Dong urged him. He didn’t know what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait. Come help me.” Huo Yuhao grasped Wang Dong’s slender and tender hands that resembled those of a girl, and connected them through the Haodong power. Wang Dong immediately felt Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection extending outward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His awe made him forget to continue asking questions. He realized, to his surprise, that Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection could cover a much greater area than before – so&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">much</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;more! He could control his Spiritual Detection to incredible precision at a whim, and he could detect the most minute detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Wang Dong’s aid, Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power could reach more than three thousand meters in a single direction. He gradually turned his head, and his Spirit Eyes scanned the Radiant City like radar. He gradually withdrew his spiritual power only after he confirmed that nothing was amiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you doing?” Wang Dong asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Let me help you equip this.” He took out a soul tool from his Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges while he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a blue soul tool that was shaped like a fan. It wasn’t that big, and it wouldn’t protrude from either side if attached to one’s back. The metal buckle could control its size, and it stretched from the shoulder and under the armpit to secure the item, while there was even a piece of leather on the area attached to the user’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s this? A flying-type soul tool?” Wang Dong asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes. I made this just for you – it’s a Class 6 flying-type soul tool, and you can use it right now. I won’t explain the principles to you, because you won’t understand anyway. This item will allow you to change directions smoothly and agilely in the sky, and all you have to do is control the handle attached to the shoulder. When you’re more familiar with it, you can even infuse soul power into it to control it. It flies extremely quickly, and is also very nimble. Even Class 6 soul engineers from the Illustrious Virtue Hall may not be able to achieve this standard.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong didn’t resist, and put the soul tool on with Huo Yuhao’s help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He infused soul power into the fan-like soul tool, and a pair of folded wings sprang out from both sides. Each wing had three sections, and every section grew from the center and gradually extended outwards. There was a small opening at the end of each wing section– this tiny flying-type soul tool actually had a total of six openings.</span></p>

He had initially thought that Wang Dong was still a Soul King, so he had pieced six small Class 5 soul tools together when was forging this item, so a Soul King would be able to control it. His own soul power wasn’t inferior to that of a Soul King, so he had a similar model for himself, except it was white.</span></p>

He used his soul power to control it nimbly, and it wasn’t difficult at all to grasp this soul tool’s controls. It didn’t take long before he was extremely comfortable with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though his Radiant Butterfly Goddess’ wings let him fly, it was far slower than this flying-type soul tool, and they weren’t suitable for prolonged flying, either. The flying-type soul tool produced by Shrek’s Soul Tool Department that he had used on his way here was a little heavy and clumsy. Huo Yuhao’s product not only boosted his flying speed, but his model’s agility and ease of control was much, much better. It was definitely the optimal item for travelling long distances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s impressive.” Wang Dong gave Huo Yuhao a satisfied nod.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chuckled and said, “I only hope that you don’t reject soul tools like you did before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’s expression changed a little and he said, “Oh, I have to remind you that my family doesn’t really approve of soul tools, so you shouldn’t use them in front of them if you can help it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was momentarily stunned. “So, your dislike for soul tools came from your family. Alright, I’ll remember that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go, then. Let me try this new thing’s flying prowess.” Wang Dong was still a youth, after all, and he had just obtained an exquisite flying-type soul tool. He was as excited as a little child that had just received a gift, and couldn’t wait to try it out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stopped him and said, “Don’t be hasty. I have something else for you.” His face grew solemn as he spoke, and he scanned his surroundings subconsciously once more before he reached for something around his waist and produced a tiny ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ring was entirely silver-white, and there were finely-drawn, simple patterns on its surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong stared at the ring, shocked. “Yuhao, you’re… you’re giving me a ring?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao snapped, “What are you thinking? It’s not a normal ring, it’s a storage-type soul tool.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong said unbendingly, “It’s still a ring.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a little taken back by his stubbornness. “Alright, take out the things inside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Wang Dong looked down at the ring, and carefully placed it on his left hand’s middle finger. The ring was a little big, and just when he frowned in response, the ring contracted when he infused soul power to extract the item contained inside. It closed around the base of his finger nicely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong was shaken by the item in his hands before he had a chance to gape at the soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an entity that was slightly bigger than his palm, similar to a round breastplate. It was ornamented with silver-white decorations around the item, and there was an enormous jewel that resembled the shape of a magnifying glass at the very center.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This jewel was pale-blue in color, and there were six sparkling lines across its surface. The peculiar hues gave people a dazzling and dizzying feeling, while the riveting radiance was extremely lifelike as sunlight shone upon it, reflecting a layer of blue back on Wang Dong’s face.</span></p>
