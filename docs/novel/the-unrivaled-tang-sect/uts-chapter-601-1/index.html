<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was already afternoon. The sun was moving towards the west, but it was still shining very brightly. She chose to enter the palace at this time to express her sincerity. In fact, for an evil soul master like her, noontime did affect her, although it wasn’t too big.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Didididi!” Deafening alarms rang throughout the entire palace without any warning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui suddenly stopped in her tracks. Her eyes turned cold. She knew what she was going to face next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran was still not going to let her off. She had given him such a good opportunity, perhaps even the last opportunity. However, he still made that choice.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran, very good, very good! I really want to see what you can do to keep me here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she smiled, Ye Xishui pointed her right hand to the sky and stood in palce without moving. Behind her, a blood-red projection had already silently surfaced. It was her martial soul, the Blood Soul Demonpuppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strong wave of spiritual pressure spread from Ye Xishui’s body. All infrastructure within a hundred meter-radius of her was instantly crushed. Very quickly, a massive plot of empty land was formed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since they were already completely at odds, there was no need for Ye Xishui to show any mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, four strong beams of light shot into the sky. These four beams of light were presented as a rainbow glow. When they rose into the sky, they quickly gathered towards the center before turning into a huge dome that completely engulfed the imperial palace within it. Suddenly, a dazzling rainbow glow covered the imperial palace. It was as if a beam of divine light had descended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a magical feeling, but Ye Xishui’s expression suddenly changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a Class 9 soul engineer, her understanding of soul tools was very deep, even though she didn’t make her name producing soul tools. Moreover, this beam of light was very familiar. How could she not recognize high-energy compression array soul tools? Precisely because she recognized them, she was aware of how terrifying they could be. They were capable of protecting an entire city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how strong a person was, he was still human. When it came to Ye Xishui’s standard, she could even guess that a god had limited strength. It was just beyond the standard of humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the strength of high-energy compression array soul tools could be increased without limits. Of course, perhaps this world might be destroyed if their strength was increased to a stage where even the ground couldn’t take it anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Theoretically, it was unlimited. Perhaps that might not manifest itself in reality, but it was certainly enough to deal with an Ultimate Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Figures started to appear from within the imperial palace. There were pitch-black human-shaped soul tools and terrifying pressure, and immense soul power undulations started to spread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion! It was the thumb of the Hand that Protects the Nation. It was truly powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from them, many soul engineers also rose into the sky along the perimeter of the palace. The Imperial Dragon, Evileye Tyrant and Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legions were all here. More than two thousand advanced-tier soul engineers had gathered within the imperial palace. An elder was drifting in mid-air at the centermost area of the palace. He was glaring at Ye Xishui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kong! De! Ming!” Ye Xishui shouted one word by one word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming stared at her coldly. “Elder Ye, I knew that we’d fight one day. I just didn’t think it would be so soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui laughed. Her laughter was shrill, and hurt everyone’s ears when they heard it, “Yes! I’ve actually expected such a day to come. I just didn’t expect Xu Tianran to completely ignore our past ties. Hehe, hehehehe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not that I’m ignoring our past ties. It’s just that we have no past ties to talk about. All these years, how many civilians have the Holy Ghost Church cruelly murdered? This time, you’ve even attacked the army, hurting the morale of my soldiers. We could have succeeded in one shot, but they had no choice but to return to the capital because of your attack. Elder Ye, do you know how many losses the Holy Ghost Church has brought to the empire? I don’t care about our past ties? Then, let me ask you, where were you and your church when Du Busi was in the capital trying to kill me? I believe you wished I had died then. A chaotic empire is more beneficial for you, am I right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran was in a golden-yellow human-shaped soul tool as he drifted in mid-air. Around him were at least ten Class 9 soul engineers. Ju Zi was half a step behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui’s smile didn’t disappear. “If you want to condemn us, you can find any excuse to. Moreover, we can’t even explain ourselves clearly even if all these dirty deeds have been blamed on us, given our reputation. War God Empress, your ploy is indeed brilliant! I just don’t know one thing. When has the Holy Ghost Church offended you?” She didn’t look at Xu Tianran, but turned her attention to Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi said, “The Holy Ghost Church didn’t offend me. You offended my army, my citizens and the peace of my empire. Evil cannot exist in an empire that’s going to dominate the continent. No matter what reason you give, it’s no longer important whether the Holy Ghost Church is the one that attacked the empire. More importantly, the Holy Ghost Church has to disappear from this world forever. It must not exist anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui was enlightened. “It seems like Your Majesty still wants to doom the church. I understand. What a strong formation! The father of soul tools, Kong Deming, is here. There are also many familiar faces and soul engineers, just to deal with me. It seems like Your Majesty still regards me very importantly. I’m grateful. The only question is, can all of you keep me here today? If I leave today, I’ll destroy one city every month, and use more avenging spirits to strengthen myself. I’ll do this until the empire is completely wiped out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While she was smiling as she said all this, no one thought that she was bluffing. This was the scariest thing. The terrifying part wasn’t the fact that she was being hysterical. The terrifying part was that there was a hint of rationality even though she was being hysterical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran’s expression changed greatly. If Ye Xishui really escaped today, a disaster would befall the empire. In his heart, he slightly regretted his decision. After all, she was an Ultimate Douluo! Even if he couldn’t use her, she shouldn’t have become his enemy. The consequences were really unthinkable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, since things were already like this, there was no room for regret. No matter what, the plan had to proceed. Moreover, Xu Tianran also didn’t think that she had a chance of survival. The Sun Moon Empire paid a huge price to set up this trap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The protective barrier formed by the four high-energy compression array soul tools was so that Ye Xishui couldn’t flee. It was also used to keep Long Xiaoyao from coming to save her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had even considered Long Xiaoyao’s mentality when they came up with this plan. After all, he wasn’t an evil soul master. He had his own bottom line. No matter what, he wouldn’t lay his hands on ordinary citizens given his current status. As for how he would take revenge after Ye Xishui was killed, that was another matter. Ju Zi had informed him that Long Xiaoyao was hurt quite badly after the clash at the mountain valley. This was why this was a very rare opportunity that couldn’t be missed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming sighed and said, “Ye Xishui, just from your words now, you deserve to die. Today, I’ll restore justice on behalf of the heavens. I’ll destroy your Blood Soul Demonpuppet.” As he spoke, Kong Deming raised his hands towards Ye Xishui. A beam of golden light shot out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui snorted coldly. She lifted her hand too and pointed at Kong Deming, and a beam of blood-red light shot towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Terrifying soul power undulations rose from the outer perimeter. The soul engineers were accumulating their power. Against the Death God Douluo, they had to give their all. This was why they had to use whatever strength they had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the blood-red light was five meters from Kong Deming, it was blocked by a layer of golden light. The cries of countless avenging spirits echoed across the sky, but the golden light was not breached at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The beam of golden light unleashed by Kong Deming turned into a golden halo when it was five meters from Ye Xishui, and was about to wrap itself around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui’s body suddenly turned illusory. In a flash, she escaped from the halo. The halo landed on the ground and disappeared without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui’s shrill laughter resonated throughout the entire palace. The Blood Soul Demonpuppet behind her shone brightly, and streaks of immense bloody lights were unleashed. They turned into giant avenging spirits in the air that rushed in all directions. Every avenging spirit was about the size of a human head. There were twelve of them. Once they appeared, a bloody rain seemed to strike the entire palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood Soul Spell! This was the ultimate technique Ye Xishui was famous for. Every blood soul that she cultivated using this spell had been cultivated for centuries. Ten thousand avenging spirits devoured one another, and the remaining survivor became a blood soul. This blood soul even had to feed on avenging spirits for a long time to become stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When a blood soul just formed, it was only the size of a fingernail. How long did it take for a blood soul to reach the size of a human head? Not only did it have to devour avenging spirits, but it even had to devour the avenging spirit of a powerful individual. The stronger an avenging spirit was, the faster a blood soul would grow.</span></p>
