<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao laughed lightly and said, “Alright, let me also tell you that the poisonous darkness element in this dagger can’t be resisted even by your Ultimate Ice. Of course, let’s not even talk about her. Her body is light-type. I’m afraid she’ll lose half her life the moment she’s stabbed. I’ll give you one minute to consider. After that, our game will begin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Yuhao, don’t!” Tang Wutong shouted. She also realized at this moment that she had recovered her ability to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao ignored her and slowly bent his waist. He picked up the dagger from the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dagger was seamless. The hilt and the blade seemed to have been carved from the same piece of metal. When held, the dagger felt icy-cold, and the darkness element in it wasn’t something that Huo Yuhao fancied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dragon Emperor Douluo, will you do everything that you promised?” Huo Yuhao straightened his back. Even though he was very pale, blood coming from his nose and mouth, and looked a little dogged right now, his back was still very straight. He was like a javelin as he stood where he was. As he faced Long Xiaoyao, he didn’t even bother to refer to him as an elder. In his heart, Long Xiaoyao wasn’t fit for the term at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao smiled and replied, “Given my identity, do you think I need to scam a fellow like you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed coldly, “Given your identity? You even use a girl to threaten me. What else can you not do? It’s a humiliation to my teacher that he once had the same status as you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s expression changed slightly. “What a razor-sharp tongue you have. You have no choice. Our game is about to begin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he slowly lifted the arm that held the dagger. He pointed the blade of the knife at Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Tang Wutong shouted, she no longer made a sound. She only watched Huo Yuhao silently. At this moment, both of them had no choice. She only wanted to see how Huo Yuhao was going to deal with such a game of death. She knew that she was now a tool in their game. No matter what she said, she wouldn’t be able to affect the proceedings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s expression changed, and he shouted, “One!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao moved. He didn’t hesitate at all. The short blade in front of him turned into a streak of black light and instantly stabbed it into his belly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah!...” Tang Wutong couldn’t help but scream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao’s expression was very calm. It was as if the dagger didn’t stab into him at all. As the icy-cold dagger penetrated his flesh, he only felt a chill in his belly. It was like a weird force was furiously sucking away his life energy. But the pain wasn’t that bad. There was only a stronger and more uncomfortable numbing sensation, like a tendon had been snapped. Even so, his expression didn’t change. It was as if he was doing something very normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I forgot. I need to add another rule.” Long Xiaoyao was still smiling. There was a weird look on his face right now. The dagger was still in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you reneging on your promise?” Huo Yuhao asked coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course not.” Long Xiaoyao smiled as he said. “I only want to tell you that every stab needs to have two holes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s face turned cold. Tang Wutong tried to struggle. However, how could she break free from the hands of an Ultimate Douluo?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared at Long Xiaoyao, “Is there anything else you want to add?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao shook his head and answered, “That’s all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao pressed against the dagger that was in his belly. Suddenly, the dagger went deeper into his body. His facial expression also changed slightly. The sharp end of the dagger poked out from his back. However, no blood seeped out from either wound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright!” Long Xiaoyao shouted too. “No wonder you’re the disciple of Mu En. You’re tough, but are you tough enough?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked at him coldly as he gripped the hilt of the dagger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Two!” Long Xiaoyao roared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao used his right hand to pluck the dagger from his body before quickly stabbing it into the other side of his belly. When the dagger penetrated his flesh, Huo Yuhao didn’t make too much noise. However, he shook tremendously when he plucked the dagger from his body. Two streams of dark blood spurted from his earlier wounds, before blood started to flow out from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao!” Tang Wutong shouted. At this moment, she had also turned pale. She only felt that things had turned blurry in front of her. However, the image of Huo Yuhao was deeply imprinted in her mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two stabs. He had stabbed himself twice without any hesitation. He didn’t have the time to consider at all. Two stabs meant that there were four wounds on his body right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao laughed, “How does it feel? Light can bring life, but darkness can devour life. Isn’t it great to personally feel life energy seeping out from your body? Don’t worry, the darkness element in my dagger isn’t very strong yet. With your abilities and spiritual power, you can handle a few more stabs if you’re tough enough. Of course, she can also help you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, give the next stab to me!” Tang Wutong suddenly shouted. Tears flowed uncontrollably from her cheeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and muttered, “Wutong, I have something to ask of you. Can I?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Three!” Long Xiaoyao interrupted him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black lights flashed and blood spurted. It was the third stab, and there were six wounds now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!...” Tang Wutong shouted. Tears flowed from her face. She only felt that she was about to suffer a mental breakdown. Her heart ached, and it left her breathless. She started to shake uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wutong, when I first entered Shrek Academy, I was only eleven years old. Then, I was a young man filled with hatred. I knew nothing. With the guidance of eldest senior and Teacher Xiao Ya, I earned the right to enter Shrek Academy. From then on, Shrek Academy became my family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At the start, life was very bitter. I cultivated every day. I knew that I was less talented than the rest. This was why I need to put in more effort than everyone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I had a roommate then who was a clean freak, but who was very lazy too. He never cleaned the room. I was the one who cleaned the room. He was very gifted, almost one of the best in our generation. In addition, he was very handsome, and his abilities were great. When he first entered the Academy, he became the center of attention. His name was Wang Dong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Huo Yuhao’s story, Tang Wutong seemed a little dazed, and there was a blurry look in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Four!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!...” She was immediately jolted awake from her blurred state of mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black lights flashed, and the fourth stab landed. There were eight wounds now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The third stab was in the middle of his belly. The fourth stab was to the left of his intestines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s voice sounded a little weak. His shirt was already dyed black from his blood. However, he was still staring at Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She wasn’t Wang Dong’er, but she looked identical to her. Huo Yuhao couldn’t feel any pain at all. He even felt that he was blissful. Even if he died, he could still watch his favorite girl live. It seemed like it wasn’t that sad after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When Wang Dong and I first started, we had some kind of confrontation. But we became friends after we attended the Academy together. I was trying to catch up to him. Suddenly, one day, we unwittingly found out that our martial souls were highly compatible. Hence, we went to the wilderness to test things out. We didn’t expect our martial souls to fuse together, and we were able to unleash a fusion skill. It’s just that we were still very weak then. After unleashing one fusion skill, our soul power would be drained. When we passed out from the fatigue, we would usually be late for school the next day, and we were punished together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Huo Yuhao’s expression turned gentler. Everything in the past replayed in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After that, we were selected to compete in our first Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament because of our impressive performance. We were reserve members. It’s just that we didn’t expect a few of our seniors to be hurt by evil soul masters, and they had to pull out. We replaced them as competitive squad members.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It was really tough then. However, we were ambitious. We worked hard, and faced our opponents with our greatest abilities. We performed miracle after miracle, turning the impossible into reality. Finally, we defended Shrek’s glory. We won the tournament for Shrek! We were then given the title of ‘Shrek’s Seven Monsters’. That was one of the greatest glories of my life.”</span></p>
