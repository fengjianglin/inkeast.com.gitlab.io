 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The practice battle was over. Tang Wutong withdrew her Golden Dragon Spear as she spun around and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hurriedly chased behind her. “What’s wrong, Wutong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong said nothing as she strode towards the tent she was resting in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’re at loggerheads now! For what? Does anyone know?” Xu Sanshi whispered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone shook their heads blankly, and only Bei Bei thought for a moment as he said, “Yuhao was deliberately giving Wutong a chance, and I think she found that out. That’s the reason why she’s upset.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really? Why did I not see that?” Jiang Nannan was a little unconvinced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei smiled faintly and said, “We all know Yuhao’s abilities. He was giving her a chance from the beginning. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have used Spiritual Blast when he was dodging away. He should have used Spiritual Shock. Furthermore, Yuhao didn’t use his Eye of the Asura from the beginning to the end. He didn’t use his martial soul true body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan asked, “Didn’t Wutong not use her martial soul true body either?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei shook his head. “No, she did. When Wutong was using her abilities related to that purplish-gold sun, she was using them with her martial soul true body. Yuhao had also used Pride of the Ice and Snow Empresses, but he didn’t use his martial soul true body. As for their fight with their weapons in the end, I didn’t understand that. But since Wutong is angry, there must clearly be a reason. Yuhao lost the fight a little too abruptly, and it didn’t seem like he had depleted all his soul power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone understood things a little better as they listened to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi chuckled and said, “I didn’t think she’d be so competitive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei continued, “She’s a Titled Douluo after all! She mustn’t feel very good because a Titled Douluo didn’t defeat a Soul Douluo, even if she was fighting against Yuhao. She should have given her full strength in that fight. I didn’t expect them to have trump cards like that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had already chased Tang Wutong back into her tent in this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong, Wutong? Talk to me. Don’t be angry,” Huo Yuhao moved next to Tang Wutong with a sheepish smile on his face. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was still pouting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something in Huo Yuhao’s eyes shifted as he suddenly used Instant Teleportation and reappeared right opposite Tang Wutong, facing her, and pressed his lips against hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s eyes immediately widened as her pouting red lips were kissed. The mild anger in her heart was like a vent as it dissipated immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in the next moment, a certain someone yelled agonizingly as a powerful beam of golden light blasted him away and sent him hurtling out of the tent, which now had a huge hole in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others from the Tang Sect all quivered as they looked on from a distance. Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, and He Caitou exchanged glances as the same thought surfaced in their heads.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s not such a good thing after all that your wife is so strong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao,” Tang Wutong dashed out from her tent as she came beside Huo Yuhao, who was lying motionless on the ground. That blast was very fierce and forceful, and even she could feel that Huo Yuhao didn’t take that hit easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao groaned as he struggled up from the ground. His body suddenly swayed just as he got to his feet, and he fell into Tang Wutong’s arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was afraid that her seal would blast him away once more, and she hurriedly supported him with her hands. “Are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No. My entire body is hurting, I can’t take it anymore,” Huo Yuhao closed his eyes as he spoke with a pained look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong hurriedly helped him back into her tent. There were thousands of people watching outside, what did they think was happening?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong helped him onto the bed once they were back in the tent. She couldn’t help but say, “You had it coming. Who asked you to kiss me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chortled. “You’re too cute when you pout. I couldn’t resist, so I had to kiss your lips. Haih, when is my father-in-law going to remove this seal?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong grunted and said, “I won’t agree even if Dad wants to remove my seal with your behaviour today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why? What’s wrong with my behaviour?” Huo Yuhao seemed aggrieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong answered, “Of course your behaviour was bad. You weren’t using your full strength from the beginning to the end!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was full of denial. “No! I just had a different fighting style. Did you not see me flipping all my trump cards in the end? But look at what’s happening! We are the ones who are flipping each other’s trump cards. Fortunately, there are no outsiders. Otherwise, we’d be in real trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong grunted again. “If others don’t understand you, how can I not? Your control over your spiritual power means you are entirely capable of switching more intricately between your martial souls, and you shouldn’t be so disoriented and messy. Furthermore, how dare you say that you completely depleted your soul power in the end?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “There was only a little bit left, so I couldn’t just faint, could I? You were so full of energy, and since I would lose in the end anyway, it didn’t make sense for me to drag it out any longer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong pouted. “Nonsense. I had almost expended all my soul power, and it’s uncertain who would win in the end if we both expended all our soul power. Furthermore, your Spirits can fight independently. Why didn’t you use them? And you didn’t use your martial soul true body either. I don’t need you to give me a chance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao grabbed her around the waist and said, “When did you become so competitive? But weren’t you holding back too? You didn’t use your Clear Sky Hammer from the beginning to the end. Don’t tell me that you only have one soul ring for that martial soul, because you have the ability to fuse two martial souls together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corner of Tang Wutong’s mouth curved into a faint smile, but she said, “I forgot.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared at her tender and pretty face that was still fuming as he went up to her ear and whispered, “I really want to bite you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong blushed. “You’re so annoying. Hurry up and cultivate to recover. Aren’t we still going to the Ice Sea?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A bite won’t delay us for too long. Come here!” Huo Yuhao came even closer with an indecent expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong dodged away. She was alert as she stared at him and said, “Are you not afraid that my seal will blast you away again? You’re not in a very good state right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt a little defeated when he heard those words. The previous hit had been quite heavy, and he could still feel throbbing pains around his body even now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Father-in-law, when will you appear? Please have mercy on me.” Huo Yuhao fell back onto the bed as he exclaimed up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutoong pursed her lips into a smile and said, “You should pray harder. My Daddy is almost never around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three battles had been fought, and Shrek Academy’s three soul engineer legions became more cohesive, while their fighting strength also improved. They crushed their opponents in every victory, and that was very beneficial for their confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had pillaged large amounts of resources, and that covered the three legions’ daily expenses and consumption. Morale was high and growing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now, the fourth battle wouldn’t happen for a long time. All the soul masters could only remain in the spectral demiplane to cultivate and wait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong left his spectral demiplane quietly after resting for an evening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They appeared at the Ice Sea’s shores. Bone-chilling winds billowed as they came out, and Tang Wutong shivered from the cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hurriedly took her into his arms as they flew high into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had stayed inside his spectral demiplane for a night, and it was already midday on the second day. They gazed in Eastern Sun City’s direction from the sky, but couldn’t see much. At least, there weren’t any traces of reinforcements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had pocketed all the aerial surveillance soul tools mercilessly after they finished pillaging the city, and stored them inside his spectral demiplane. The entire city immediately became both blind and deaf. They didn’t have satellites to pass information on, and they couldn’t send word inland within a short period of time for them to send reinforcements. Eastern Sun City was the largest city in the north, and they had to seek aid from large cities inland so that they could find military forces strong enough to support them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their enemy was gone, so the most important matter for them was to send out information while redirecting food to the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eastern Sun City’s first target was Oak City, which was the previous target of Huo Yuhao’s team, when they sent out their messengers. Oak City was one of the most important food warehouses in the north, but it was a pity that their reply was a negative one. All the food left in Eastern Sun City was only enough to sustain their citizens for a week, and disaster would strike if that was dragged out any longer. Eastern Sun City’s rulers were so busy that they were already up to their ears with work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Huo Yuhao didn’t know what the exact situation was, he could still make a rough guess. He smiled at Tang Wutong and said, “I estimate that Eastern Sun City will need a week to transmit any information to Radiant City. I wonder how Xu Tianran will react when he finds out what has happened.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong said, “Hopefully, he will turn his armies around in time. We will have achieved our goal if that happens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head. “It won’t be that simple. The Sun Moon Empire has mobilized their armies to start an invasion, and they won’t change their strategies so easily just because their back ranks have become a little unstable. Therefore, matters at the frontlines won’t change unless the danger in their back ranks reaches a certain threshold. Therefore, our mission has barely begun. When the time comes that Xu Tianran feels that the chaos in his back ranks is threatening his rule, then we have a chance of successfully drawing his armies at the front lines back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong said, “Come, let’s go to the Ice Sea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao held her little hand, and Haodong power flowed through their bodies as they flew towards the Ice Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were in the Extreme North, but the ocean’s surface hadn’t completely frozen over. The ocean was vast and there was no end in sight, while there was warm water flowing beneath the cold waves. This resulted in enormous icebergs and glaciers appearing above the ocean’s surface, but the ocean wasn’t completely frozen over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even then, the temperature in this place was so low that normal people couldn’t survive. Blocks of ice floated along the ocean’s icy surface as chilly winds cut to the bone. The winds carried some of the ocean’s pungent smells and chills as they whooshed by continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t afraid of the cold at all. Furthermore, his soul power recovered even more quickly in such an environment, like he was a fish in water.</span></p>
