 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong needed to use her soul power to defend herself against the cold. But she was a Titled Douluo after all, and she wasn’t called the Dragon Butterfly Douluo for nothing. This little bit of cold couldn’t threaten her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If we were to fight on the Ice Sea, Wutong, you would be no match for me.” Huo Yuhao laughed as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong sounded a little unconvinced. “How do you know if we haven’t tried it? If you’re unconvinced, we can fight again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No. I don’t want to fight with you. If I beat you, my heart hurts. If I lose, my body hurts. This means it doesn’t make sense for me to fight at all. How can I fight you?” Huo Yuhao laughed as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong hammered him gently, but she was all smiles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them flew inward. They weren’t flying very quickly, and they seemed very relaxed, but Huo Yuhao was continuously sweeping the Ice Sea for disturbances with his spiritual power. He would even extend his spiritual power into the seawater to investigate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many aquatic beings swimming around beneath the icy surface, and there were quite a few aquatic soul beasts. However, they didn’t dare to attack Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong once they sensed their formidable auras.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The temperature continued to drop as they flew further towards the north, while the number of floating ice blocks continually increased. Enormous icebergs could be seen wherever they went, and there were some especially huge ones that looked like tiny islands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some aquatic soul beasts on the icy surface. They glared at Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, but they didn’t dare to come close. Soul beasts were very sensitive, and Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong didn’t deliberately mask their auras. Normal soul beasts who had relatively low cultivations didn’t dare to think about attacking them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They flew for fifteen minutes, and were now very far from land. Huo Yuhao summoned the Snow Empress from his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao asked, “Snow Empress, how are we going to find the Mermaids?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress appeared beside Huo Yuhao with a flash of white light. She took a deep breath as she came out, and her face was overcome with satisfaction. She was an Icesky Snow Lady, so icy environments like this were her favourite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress explained, “Across history, Mermaids have lived deep in the Ice Sea. You have to continue outward. Don’t worry, you won’t be in much danger. Typical aquatic soul beasts can’t fight against the strength and speed that the two of you possess. But when you meet formidable opponents that you can’t defeat, fly up into the sky. Aquatic soul beasts will become increasingly weaker the further they are from the ocean; all aquatic soul beasts are limited by this fact no matter their cultivation. You should call me again after flying for another two hours at your current speed, and I will find a way to summon those Mermaids for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright!” Huo Yuhao nodded in agreement. The Snow Empress’ eyes were full of longing as she glanced at the Ice Sea around her before she returned to Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t because she didn’t want to fly above the Ice Sea along with Huo Yuhao. If she was outside while they were flying at high speeds, she would add to Huo Yuhao’s burden and energy consumption.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was much more confident after his battle with Tang Wutong yesterday. If he teamed up with her, not even typical Transcendent Douluos could defeat them. Even if certain opponents were more powerful, couldn’t they run away if they couldn’t beat them? Furthermore, they were on the Ice Sea, where his abilities were greatly amplified. Without talking about anything else, those tough ice blocks were all conductors for his Ice Explosion. He didn’t have to fear anything even if he was faced with large numbers of aquatic soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He held Tang Wutong’s hand as they maintained their high speed at about a thousand meters above the ocean’s surface while they proceeded further out. Huo Yuhao was confident, but he wasn’t careless. He was using Spiritual Detection from the beginning to the end so that he could feel everything that was changing around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very few soul beasts appeared in the sky above the Ice Sea. At least, they hadn’t discovered any soul beasts throughout their journey. It was clear that this place was like a forbidden zone for flying soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An hour passed in the blink of an eye. They could no longer sense any kind of land, but more and more icebergs began to appear on the ocean’s surface. The entire ocean appeared white as they gazed into the horizon, and it grew increasingly harder to see the water. The temperature in this place was getting closer and closer to the temperature at the Extreme North’s core regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was holding Tang Wutong’s hand, and he continuously used his Ice Empress Jade Scorpion to absorb the chill from her body into his own to dispel it. He could help Tang Wutong conserve some soul power to defend herself against the cold this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s nobody else besides us. This tranquility with only ice, snow, and the vast ocean does feel good!” Tang Wutong smiled as she spoke to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed and said, “This place is too quiet. It might feel curious and novel for a day or two, but you’ll probably get too lonely if you have to stay in this place for too long.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong winked and said, “Do I have that low a tolerance for loneliness?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao continued, “I’m just talking about normal human conditions. I won’t let you be lonely if you’re with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I feel like eating your grilled fish!” Tang Wutong laughed as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was shocked as he hurriedly placed his index finger to his lips. “My love, we are above a large ocean’s surface. Even though the aquatic soul beasts beneath the Ice Sea are not all fish-type soul beasts, most of them are related. If we grill fish in a place like this, we’re picking a fight with all the soul beasts here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong giggled and said, “I’m just joking. Look at how scared you are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression suddenly changed as his smile disappeared. His eyes grew focused as he stared in a certain direction, and he tugged on Tang Wutong as they began to slow down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a pair of icy-cold eyes staring right at them from an enormous iceberg in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those were enormous living beings, and there were several hundred of them lying prostrate on an iceberg. Huo Yuhao pulled on Tang Wutong because he could feel their intense hostility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s that?” Tang Wutong stared into the distance curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her vision couldn’t compare to Huo Yuhao’s, but she could still feel things in the distance with the help of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many black soul beasts, and they were all of different sizes. The largest ones were more than a dozen meters long, and emanated faint blue hues. The smallest ones were only a little longer than a meter, and every single one had two sharp tusks protruding from their mouths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sea Devilwalruses! There are so many.” Huo Yuhao frowned a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sea Devilwalruses were a species of aquatic soul beasts that were very characteristic. Soul masters didn’t understand much about aquatic soul beasts, but there had been an introduction to aquatic soul beasts back when they were studying in Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sea Devilwalrus was a species of soul beast that was considered relatively docile, and their most salient characteristic was their extraordinarily formidable defensive capabilities. A grown Sea Devilwalrus would be more than seven meters long, and a Sea Devilwalrus was considered an adult when it had more than a hundred years of cultivation. Its seven-meter-long frame was very muscular, and its skin was more than ten centimeters thick. Their skin was extremely tough, and very resistant to all kinds of physical attacks. Sea Devilwalruses residing in the Ice Sea were probably also very resistant to ice-type and fire-type attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, all soul beasts had their strengths and weaknesses. In comparison to their formidable defenses, they came up short on offense and speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sea Devilwalruses only became a lot faster in the water; they were very slow when they were above water. They only possessed several abilities to control water or ice to attack, and those attacks weren’t considered powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sea Devilwalruses lived in herds, and ten over walruses formed a herd. Several hundred walruses appearing at the same time was, at least, not mentioned in Shrek Academy’s teachings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao made an accurate judgment with just one look. “These Sea Devilwalruses have very average cultivation ranks. The strongest ones are ten thousand year soul beasts, and there are three of them. There rest have varying cultivations, and there are even some with ten years. Seems like this place is their natural habitat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao explained this to Tang Wutong as he pulled her onto a new route. Sea Devilwalruses at this cultivation didn’t threaten them at all. Furthermore, they were flying a thousand meters in the sky. With Huo Yuhao’s understanding of Sea Devilwalruses, even those with ten thousand year cultivations couldn’t attack at a range of more than a thousand meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They would just fly over them. From his perspective, this was just a small interlude in their journey across the Ice Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were flying very quickly across the sky, and they were just about to fly over the iceberg that those walruses were group up on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, several leading Sea Devilwalruses took out some strange objects. They looked like large light gold &nbsp;conch shells. Twelve walruses took out shells like that, and started blowing them forcefully as deep trumpeting sounds could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s expressions changed when they heard those sounds, because they could vividly feel that the air around them had tensed up. The airflow around them seemed to completely vanish in the next moment as they felt their bodies plummet rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Any living being who wished to fly in the sky had to rely on airflow. They had to use their soul power to push against the air currents so that they could fly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When all the airflow and even physical substances had disappeared from the sky, they would be in something like an incredibly clean vacuum. They couldn’t leverage anything, so they would plummet from the pull of gravity. Even the Class 9 flying-type soul tools behind their backs became useless in such circumstances. Outstretched wings that couldn’t rely on any airflow were useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Falling from a thousand meters in the sky wasn’t funny at all. Even though Huo Yuhao didn’t know what those walruses had done, he could always keep his cool when faced with danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao tugged on Tang Wutong’s hand as she immediately went behind him and wrapped her hands around his waist, while her dragon wings stretched as wide as they could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if there wasn’t any airflow in the sky, they would still produce some resistance in the process of dropping down. They could reduce their falling speed as long as they could draw on some air resistance.</span></p>
