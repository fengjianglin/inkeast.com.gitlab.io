He watched the soul tool that measured their altitude as he sensed the White Tiger Duke’s surging soul power, filled with complex feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was his father’s back, wide and strong, and giving him a sense of security!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao, who had transformed into a White Tiger, was still rising quickly. In just a few seconds, he managed to climb a few more hundred meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The night sky was getting quieter. Right now, the lights that came from below them also became unclear. Everything around them was pitch-black and cold. However, Huo Yuhao wasn’t terrified at all. He didn’t know why… it might have been because of Dai Hao, or for some other reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dim white light was shining from the White Tiger Duke’s fur. The extremely low surrounding temperature also spurred Huo Yuhao to unleash his Ice Empress’ Armor to protect himself from being frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke’s aura was at its limit. Even though he didn’t unleash it toward Huo Yuhao, Huo Yuhao still felt slightly petrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he felt as if some kind of energy in his body was being summoned just as he was petrified. This feeling was very weird. Huo Yuhao quickly found the source of this energy... blood! More accurately speaking, it was his lineage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the lineage that he had inherited from his father! When the White Tiger Duke unleashed his soul power to his full ability, the power of his own lineage rose along with his martial soul. Huo Yuhao shared the same blood as him, while his cultivation was also weaker than the White Tiger Duke’s. Naturally, he was drawn by the White Tiger Duke’s lineage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood is thicker than water. Given that they were directly related, the connection of their lineage was undoubtedly very close. Under such a situation, Huo Yuhao felt even closer to the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The circulation of the White Tiger Duke’s blood was increasing quickly. Also, Huo Yuhao was astonished to realize that the White Tiger Duke’s aura seemed to have some kind of weird power that was fusing into his body in streaks. His circulation was increasing quickly as this power fused into his body. As the weird power spread over him, Huo Yuhao’s real eyes couldn’t help but appear. To prevent the White Tiger Duke from finding out, he had no choice but to use his Imitation to conceal them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao!” the White Tiger Duke’s voice sounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes?” Huo Yuhao was immediately jolted to his senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can send you to an altitude of almost six thousand meters. If I continue to rise further, I’m afraid that you’ll drain too much of your soul power when you glide over the mountains. My limit is around fifty-eight hundred to six thousand meters. Do you think you need to reach a greater height?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “There’s no need to. Fifty-five hundred meters is sufficient.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright then, prepare yourself!” The White Tiger Duke’s body started to shine even brighter. The glaring white lights engulfed Huo Yuhao’s body and isolated him from the cold. He turned into a ball of intense white light that rose further into the sky. In an instant, they rose several hundred more meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes brightened, and his soul power surged, completely transforming into Ultimate Ice. Given his immense spiritual power, he could sense more than one thousand meters around him, even without his Spirit Eyes. He knew that the White Tiger’s sudden outburst meant that the mission was about to begin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, the white light slowly retracted after a moment. The White Tiger’s momentum seemed to have stopped. The huge White Tiger turned into a ball of light that surrounded Huo Yuhao. As the white light surged, the White Tiger disappeared, and the White Tiger Duke had already returned to Huo Yuhao’s back. He grabbed Huo Yuhao’s waist and shouted, “Yuhao, you must be careful, and mind your safety. Don’t be reckless. I’m going to send you in. Get ready!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao simply acknowledged his words. His Ice Empress’ Armor strengthened slightly, and a stalk of shiny and smooth Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass appeared on his shoulder. It released an icy-blue aura around Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke shouted, and the veins on his burly arms bulged. His explosive strength was instantly unleashed. He exerted strength from his waist and flung Huo Yuhao out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao rolled up naturally in the air and shot forward more than a few hundred meters like a grenade. As he shot forward, he slowly opened up his body like a big bird. A butterfly-shaped flying-type soul tool opened up behind his back and stabilized his body in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke drifted in mid-air. After seeing that Huo Yuhao had stabilized his body and flownoff &nbsp;into the distance, he heaved a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he personally witnessed it, he couldn’t believe that Huo Yuhao could survive at such a high altitude even though he was only just a Soul Sage. His Ultimate Ice was indeed extraordinary!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the White Tiger Duke focused his gaze. He was stunned to discover that Huo Yuhao, who was within his field of view just earlier, had already disappeared. He had disappeared without a trace. Even with his acute senses as a Titled Douluo, he wasn’t able to locate him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kid! He’s indeed unparalleled in his surveillance abilities! How did he manage to do this? Even if he possesses twin martial souls, shouldn’t he be using his Ultimate Ice martial soul? How is he able to use his spiritual-type martial soul at the same time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was normal for the White Tiger Duke to be unable to comprehend this. He was still very unfamiliar with the newly-discovered Spirit system.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Huo Yuhao was gifted, he couldn’t use two martial souls at the same. However, it was different if he had a Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More accurately speaking, the Ice Empress was his martial soul. She wasn’t considered his Spirit. However, the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass was a pure Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass appeared on Huo Yuhao’s shoulder, it immediately had a protective effect on him. The extremely low temperature in the sky couldn’t affect the Ice Grass, which favored low temperatures. In the thin air, there was only one element that was in abundance... ice! The Ice Grass tapped into this power after it appeared to create a layer of icy air around Huo Yuhao that helped to protect him. Huo Yuhao then changed his martial soul to his Spirit Eyes and unleashed them, melting into the night sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The powerful effects of a Spirit were immaculately demonstrated on Huo Yuhao, who had twin martial souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He unleashed his butterfly wings, but Huo Yuhao didn’t increase his speed to the maximum. After changing to his Spirit Eyes, the thin air continued to affect him, but not too badly. As for the external cold, he wasn’t bothered at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he unleashed his spiritual power, he started to survey the lands below him. He suddenly realized that he enjoyed the feeling of this quiet night sky. Up here, no biological organism could survive for long. It was rare for any living organism to even attempt to reach such an altitude. He felt as if he were the only person in the world. Although it was lonely, there was still an exhilarating feeling of freedom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Up here, the restraints of the world didn’t seem to be a problem anymore. His mood gradually entered an ethereal state. His soul power slowed down through a very special method, and his spiritual and soul power fused together perfectly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Huo Yuhao seemed to have entered an ascended state. It was like his first time in the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, but it also felt like his first time looking at the boundless sea of clouds when he first climbed Clear Sky Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body fused with nature, and a layer of dim golden light shone about him. The golden light was clear, as if he had become a star. It seemed like Huo Yuhao had become a part of the sky right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The summoning feeling that he had once sensed in the Spirit Pagoda appeared once again. Perhaps it was because he was high up in the sky, but this summoning feeling was even clearer this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao suddenly felt that his entire world had turned golden. The pitch-black night sky was no longer dark. It was as if some special power of longing was about to descend from the sky onto his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a strong dark aura spread from his chest. A strong power of darkness spread, and a layer of thin scales appeared once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rise of this darkness jolted Huo Yuhao to his senses. He furrowed his brow and quickly exited his exalted state.</span></p>
