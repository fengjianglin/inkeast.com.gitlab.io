 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and replied, “No, let’s not enter for now. Let’s observe a little longer first. There are some surveillance soul tools that I’m unfamiliar with. It’s best to be careful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he came to Heaven Dou City, Huo Yuhao was actually a little eager. If the Sun Moon Empire’s army needed a place to reorganize, Heaven Dou City would be the most suitable place to do so. There were plenty of resources here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a pity that there wasn’t an army outside the city. Huo Yuhao even had the illusion that their army had disappeared. This was a very frightening feeling for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong asked, “Should we capture someone and interrogate him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “I’m afraid only those in power will know any military secrets. Let’s observe first before we find anyone. Once we find someone, we’ll ‘invite’ him out at night.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he had already focused his Spiritual Detection inside the palace. He scanned the place in detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, Huo Yuhao found a very familiar figure. He had once met this person the last time he was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was Jing Hongchen, the Dean of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the original Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy was long gone by now. The Illustrious Virtue Hall was also gone. Huo Yuhao didn’t know if they had been rebuilt. However, it seemed like Jing Hongchen would have nothing to do with them even if they were rebuilt, judging from the fact that he was in this city now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Jing Hongchen continued to back Xu Tianran, Xu Tianran still threw him one side after he gained the throne. Of course, Heaven Dou City was still very important. To be the mayor of this city was still considered good enough for Jing Hongchen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only did he find Jing Hongchen, but Huo Yuhao also discovered two very familiar people. Both of them had once given him a lot of trouble on a competition stage. Huo Yuhao hadn’t expected them to be alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wutong, guess who I found?” Huo Yuhao mysteriously asked Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was curious as she asked, “Who? From your expression, it seems like it’s someone we know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded. “Do you still remember that lady who once had a crush on you? She was really nice to you.” As he spoke until here, he couldn’t help but chuckle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She had a crush on me?” Tang Wutong was stunned. After this, she recalled, “Are you talking about Meng Hongchen? I always thought she had died in that huge explosion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and answered, “No, she didn’t die. She’s in the palace right now. She’s not the only one. Xiao Hongchen is also here. Enemies always cross the same path! We fought them to the death once. Xiao Hongchen was heavily hurt. I didn’t expect him to survive. In addition, they aren’t weak right now. They should be Soul Douluo. Even though they can’t compare to us, they are still one of the better ones in the Sun Moon Empire. Come to think about it, they can’t be considered soul engineers. They’re more like soul masters. Xiao Hongchen’s talent is astonishing. I wonder how their fighting strength is right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s expression turned weird. “We’re supposed to be enemies, but for some reason, you seem to be very excited talking about them. They’re really our old foes. Yuhao, let them off this time. Let’s not kill them, okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled as he nodded and said, “I have the same feeling as you. Let’s not kill them. I didn’t have the intention of killing them either. Let’s just pay them a visit. As for Jing Hongchen, we’ll let him off as long as he tells us what we want to know. If not for the pressure they placed on me, I wouldn’t have developed so quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them looked at each other and smiled. When a person’s abilities reached a certain level, there were many things in the past that they didn’t care about anymore. At least, this was what was happening to the two of them right now. Jing Hongchen’s family could no longer pose any threat to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night fell. Huo Yuhao held Tang Wutong’s hand and confidently walked into the palace, camouflaged in the darkness of the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection and Imitation combined perfectly. Along with delicate control of his Snowy Domain of Ultimate Ice, Huo Yuhao managed to modify their body temperatures. He also used spatial power to alter any traces of their presence. With their twin soul cores, they could appear and disappear anytime and anywhere they wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether it was oscillation detectors, thermal detectors or spiritual detectors, Huo Yuhao could anticipate them beforehand and react accordingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi was right. Huo Yuhao possessed some abilities that were on the level of an Ultimate Douluo. These surveillance soul tools were completely useless against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unless the Sun Moon Empire came up with a soul tool that could seal space, it would be very difficult for them to discover him at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They walked into the palace as if they were walking into their garden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Dou City’s Imperial Palace had a long history. When it still belonged to the Heavenly Soul Empire, the furnishings and decorations inside the palace weren’t considered very new or modern. Instead they were very simple and ancient. It had appeared very dignified and awe-inspiring at the same time. It was just that some soul lamps now affected the simple and ancient feel inside the palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he looked at the dirty spots on the walls, Huo Yuhao knew that the Sun Moon Empire had no intention of refurbishing this palace. It was a pity. It was really a pity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao still recalled the significance of this city to the Tang Sect. The sect came from Heaven Dou City! There was even a large courtyard in this city that belonged to the Tang Sect. No matter what happened in the future, he was intent on reclaiming that courtyard. That was also Tang Ya’s wish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the guidance of his Spiritual Detection, they quickly entered the palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were five hundred troops stationed inside the palace. Apart from them, there were another a hundred soul engineers. These soul engineers were responsible for a soul formation that was used to defend the entire palace. They coordinated with all types of surveillance soul tools. To ordinary people, this place was impenetrable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that wasn’t true for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He revealed a smile on his face and led Tang Wutong to the front of a palace hall. He stopped a few steps in front of the door and shared his Spiritual Detection with Tang Wutong. A three-dimensional image appeared in their minds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the palace hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen gently sipped on a cup of wine. There was a comfortable look on his elderly-looking face. “Great wine, this is great wine! Such great wine is one of the best in the Heavenly Soul Empire. Even Xu Tianran might not have tasted such great wine in his life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a strange expression on Huo Yuhao’s face. Jing Hongchen was so domineering in the past, but he was relegated to tasting wine now. This was completely not his style!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he was in control of the Illustrious Virtue Hall and Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, his authority was unrivaled. The Illustrious Virtue Hall was one of the most prestigious research organizations in the Sun Moon Empire, along with the Worship Hall. It had played a huge role in the development of the Sun Moon Empire’s technology.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his aura right now was much different from before. His cultivation even seemed to have fallen. It was very reflective of how his mentality had changed over the years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandpa, you should drink less.” Meng Hongchen was advising him from one side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen snorted. “What do I do if I don’t drink? In this city, I’m not needed unless something special happens. I’m only a figurehead here. Xu Tianran, I helped you to where you are now, but I’ve landed in such a state. You even excluded me from the rebuilding of the Illustrious Virtue Hall. Since that’s the case, what else can I do except drink and rot here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Hongchen was furious as he said, “Xu Tianran is too despicable. You contributed so much for him in the past. You supported him when no one did. But he’s treated you like this. Isn’t that just because he controls the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion now? He dared to kick you to one side and give the important roles to those around him. He’s really despicable. He only steers clear of those from the Worship Hall. In my opinion, he wouldn’t even care about the Worship Hall if his Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion was stronger. Grandpa, I don’t understand. Why didn’t you go to the Worship Hall in the past?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen sighed and replied, “It’s not that I’m unwilling. I didn’t have the face to do it! How can I face your great-grandfather after the Illustrious Virtue Hall was destroyed in my hands? How can I go to the Worship Hall if I have no face to see him? Why did you think I came here to take up this post? If Xu Tianran didn’t tell your great-grandfather before he sent me here, would he have dared to treat me like this? Your great-grandfather didn’t say anything because he wanted to punish me! What could I say? I could only go. I’ll probably be stuck here for the rest of my life. However, don’t learn from me. Both of you are extremely talented. All these years, both of you have been improving too. I’m only keeping you here so that you’ll shock the world one day. When both of you become Titled Douluo, our Hongchen family will rise once again. When that happens, both of you can find your great-grandfather. I no longer have any potential, but you still do. When you enter the Worship Hall, that’ll be the day that the Hongchen family rises once again. When that happens, you must fight for control of the Illustrious Virtue Hall. It’s the core of our empire!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening to Jing Hongchen’s words, Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen nodded. Xiao Hongchen even clenched his fists. “Grandpa, don’t worry. We’ll work hard. One day, we’ll become the best!”</span></p>
