 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the most prominent characteristics of solid-state soul power was the fact that they could leverage on the origin energy of heaven and earth in the air better. Huo Yuhao had already felt this in his experiment from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the solid-state soul power didn’t absorb the soul master’s own soul power, it would still continuously absorb the origin energy in the air by itself. The pertinent soul skill’s strength would therefore increase throughout this process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This experiment was equivalent to opening a door to another world for Huo Yuhao, and it allowed him to see stranger things regarding soul masters. The first thing he wanted to do when he returned to the Academy was to seek out Elder Xuan so that he could get answers to his questions and clear up his confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, are you alright? Why are you always in such a daze? Did your injuries this time damage your brain?” Tang Wutong was flying beside him, and she couldn’t help but ask him that question.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fellow has been like this over the past few days. Everyone is worried about him, but they can’t really press him any further for fear of upsetting him. He keeps saying that’s he’s fine, he’s alright… but he doesn’t seem like he’s alright at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” Huo Yuhao was deep in thought, and his thoughts became a little jumbled when he heard Tang Wutong’s voice. He frowned a little and said, “Of course I’m fine. I’m just thinking about some things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong rolled her eyes and said, “What do you have to think about that you have to do it for a few days? It’s fine if something is wrong with you, just treat it as quickly as possible. Don’t force yourself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao snapped, “Nothing is wrong with me. I’m perfectly fine. There are some questions that I need to think more about, so don’t interrupt my train of thought.” With that, he continued flying forward as he began to contemplate once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This guy!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Tang Wutong glared at him, but he didn’t respond at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He doesn’t recognize my good intentions at all. Hmph!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone flew continuously until midday before Xu Sanshi, who had taken point, suggested that everyone descend and take a rest. It was not quite a coincidence that they descended onto a spot next to a wide river.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This enormous river was a hundred meters wide, and the flow of the water was rapid. Even though it wasn’t very clear, the bluish-green river water’s clarity was decent if its volume was taken into account.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Yuhao, I want to eat grilled fish. This river is so huge, I’m sure there are enough fish here. They must be very fat and juicy,” Nan Qiuqiu exclaimed happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah? Grilled fish?” Huo Yuhao stared at her, and his eyes looked a little blank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi smiled and said, “Yes, Yuhao. Your grilled fish is the best in the world. Give us another taste of it! Everyone will probably get busy once we get back to the Academy. You should also stop thinking and rest your mind a little bit. You should switch up your thoughts once in a while, no matter what you’re contemplating.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t really decline the request as he saw everyone’s hopeful eyes. He nodded and went ahead to catch some fish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong secretly swallowed some saliva after she heard that they were eating grilled fish. She could still vividly recall the savory aroma from the last time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Catching fish was like using a hot knife on butter for a Soul Sage. Huo Yuhao chose to use the simplest and most brutal method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He froze some of the river’s water before he transformed it into icy spheres and detonated them in the water with Ice Explosion. The shockwaves flipped a large amount of fish out, and Huo Yuhao used Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon to pull them onto shore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire process took a little more than ten seconds, and he proceeded to then process the fish. Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu had already gone to collect firewood, while the others helped out in their own way to prepare rations and start a fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s movements were extremely quick. His deep thoughts over the past few days were very helpful to him, and he had an increasingly strong feeling that he had found the right path. Therefore, he was eager to continue thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fish were processed after a short while, and a fire was started. The grilling had begun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t do anything different from the last time. He was still very familiar with the techniques for grilling fish, and grilled fish quickly appeared one after another in his companions’ hands for them to enjoy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, this is good, it’s so good,” Nan Qiuqiu exclaimed in elation as she ate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was also eating, but she realized that today’s grilled fish seemed a little different from the last time when they were travelling toward the Star Luo Empire’s Northwestern Field Army. The fish still tasted fresh and delicious, while the fire had been controlled extremely well... but something seemed to be missing. In a more exaggerated sense, the grilled fish seemed to lack spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong sat down beside Jiang Nannan. She couldn’t help but whisper, “Sister Nannan, do you see any difference between the grilled fish today and the one we had the last time?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan was momentarily stunned. “Difference? Nope! The fish is very tasty. You don’t’ think it’s nice?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong shook her head and replied, “Not that... I just feel like something seems to be missing from the last time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan was dazed for another moment before a deep look appeared in her eyes. She whispered, “I think you’re right. Huo Yuhao thought you were Dong’er when he grilled fish for everyone the last time. He gave voice to the emotions in his inner heart when he was grilling for you. Afterwards, because he realized that you’re not Dong’er, he has treated you like everyone else.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” Tang Wutong stared at Jiang Nannan, surprised. She turned her eyes toward the grilled fish in her hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fish is missing emotions? It’s missing a spirit? Can emotions be infused into a fish? In that case, his feelings for Wang Dong’er must be very deep!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For some reason, envy began to develop in her heart as her thoughts stopped here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was satisfied after eating the grilled fish, and they continued their journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was midnight when they arrived back at Shrek City. Xu Sanshi and the others went back to the Tang Sect, while Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong went to Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was the group leader, so he had to report the results of their expedition to Elder Xuan. Tang Wutong didn’t belong to the Tang Sect, and was staying in Shrek Academy in the first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Darkness covered the skies. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong weren’t flying anymore, walking toward Shrek Academy as a form of respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek City had transformed quite a bit over this period of time. With the full effort of the Academy and the Douluo continent’s three native empires, the new Shrek City’s construction speed was one of the fastest on the continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At to their current speed, they would need a year at most before Shrek City’s overall structure took shape, and they would need another three years after that before the new city would be completely established.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the new Shrek City was constructed, its scale would rival that of Star Luo City and Heaven Dou City. It would be second only to the Sun Moon Empire’s Radiant City, which was the largest city on the continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Academy’s main gates were already shut. However, that didn’t pose a problem to Huo Yuhao or Tang Wutong at all. Huo Yuhao didn’t want to disturb anyone, so he used Imitation before he concealed both Tang Wutong and himself, and they discreetly leapt over the wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sea God’s Lake came into view in the distance. Huo Yuhao stopped as he arrived at the lakeside, and Tang Wutong did the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The night sky was impressive tonight. Moonlight shone across the Sea God’s Lake, casting light on the lake’s clear ripples and waves. The moonlight was gentle, while all sorts of vegetation was growing by the lakeside. The Sea God’s Island was barely visible in the distance, as if this were a paradise on earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao began to feel dazed as he saw everything in front of him. He could still clearly remember the first time he realized that Dong’er was a girl; weren’t they on Sea God’s Lake?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sea God’s Fated Blind Date. Everything that had happened that day left an extremely deep impression in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Idiot… I’m her idiot. I was with her for such a long time, yet I didn’t realize she was a girl. That was really stupid of me!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He recounted all the sweetness and tenderness he had shared with Dong’er, and the corner of his mouth curled into a faint smile. He felt as if he could see Dong’er once more under the moonlight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dong’er, have you really been beside me this entire time? But why don’t you show yourself to me?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao reached inside as he reminisced, and retrieved the handkerchief that he had treasured this entire time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was only momentarily stunned by the beautiful scenery on Sea God’s Lake after she arrived. She was about to return to Sea God’s Island, but she immediately realized that Huo Yuhao was in a daze once more. Except, this one was very different from the last time. The way he was dazed before seemed very muddleheaded, as if he were very deep in thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his eyes were very gentle at this moment, much like the moonlight reflecting off the lake. The corner of his mouth was curled upward, and there was a slight smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She instantly froze when she saw him reach into his shirt and take out a handkerchief that felt extremely familiar to her.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That… isn’t that my handkerchief?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao closed his eyes as he held onto the handkerchief and slowly took a deep breath through his nose. The moist air on the lakeside and the clear and fresh smell of vegetation wafted into his nose, while the handkerchief’s crisp aroma that he had yearned for was also part of all those refreshing smells that he was familiar with. He felt as if his heart and mind were both intoxicated as his entire body relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was just watching from beside him. She blushed a little,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why is he holding my handkerchief? Does that mean he knows that I was sleeping beside him that night?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao opened his eyes as he looked down at the handkerchief in his hands and heaved a faint sigh. “Dong’er, when will you return to my side? Have you really forgotten about me, or do you have some hidden troubles? If you have any problems, why don’t you let me face them together with you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bastard! He thinks my handkerchief belongs to her.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was so upset that she started to pout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was completely immersed in his wonderful memories. Naturally, he wasn’t paying attention to Tang Wutong’s emotional changes. However, she didn’t disturb him, and was just standing next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This bastard… he’s quite concentrated in his love.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong couldn’t help but recall the first time she had met Huo Yuhao. He almost immediately charged at her and embraced her in his arms. That embrace was burning with passion and filled with emotions. Tang Wutong was overcome with embarrassment that time, but she felt as if she were about to melt in his arms. She began to feel a little feverish when she recalled that moment.</span></p>
