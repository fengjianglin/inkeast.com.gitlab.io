It rotated in the air and absorbed the icy-blue beam. The beam disappeared, while the fiery-red flower merely dimmed a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady’s attack wasn’t that powerful, but it was still Ultimate Ice. It was absorbed and dispelled so easily, so it wasn’t difficult to imagine what the red water’s temperature was like. It had to be a temperature produced by Ultimate Fire!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The large pink flower seemed to have been infuriated at this moment, and every single petal began to tremble before they started to sway rhythmically, and they shifted as if they were lifting something upwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s mouth hung slack as he looked on in fright. Flower after flower that resembled the one that had just appeared were created from the red lake water and positioned behind this huge pink flower. There were thousands of them, and they congregated behind the large pink flower in throngs and masses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow can actually control the strange lake water...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao hadn’t imagined he would end up facing off against so many entities that originated from Ultimate Fire, and he was almost ready to tuck tail and run without any hesitation at all. However, an amicable female voice could be heard right at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Human, it’s your good fortune that you can make it here, but I will no longer show you mercy if you continue to provoke me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s charged soul thrusters were prepared to erupt before he suddenly stopped everything. He stared at the giant pink flower before him with slack eyes and his jaw half-open as he mumbled, “You… you can talk?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had encountered soul beasts who could talk before, but it was the first time he had seen plants who could talk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er came up beside Huo Yuhao with a flash of golden light and grabbed his hand. Her face was full of anxiety as she muttered, “That’s a hundred-thousand year plant-type soul beast. Prepare to run!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, one hundred thousand years! Typically, only hundred-thousand year soul beasts could speak the human language. The Cerberus that he had seen before could speak the human language, and this peculiar giant flower before him also could. This meant the flower was likely to be a hundred-thousand year plant-type soul beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how much confidence Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er had in their abilities, they would never consider themselves strong enough to fight a hundred-thousand year soul beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hundred-thousand year soul beast was comparable to a powerful Titled Douluo, and certain especially formidable hundred-thousand year soul beasts could challenge a Transcendent Douluo. They had actually run into an unassailable problem!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not a hundred-thousand year soul beast.” The giant pink flower’s petals began to open and close, and her voice was just so friendly and warm that the two of them felt extremely comfortable listening to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, you have an aura similar to the ice well... no wonder you could break through the Jade Phosphorous Flowers outside to reach this place.” The large flower muttered under her breath, and there seemed to be a hint of excitement in her voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er’s soul power was completely interjoined. They glanced at each other, and they could see the astonishment in each other’s eyes. This flower was clearly a hundred-thousand year soul beast, yet she claimed that she wasn’t. Furthermore, her voice sounded warm and amicable, and it didn’t seem like she harbored any intention of attacking them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was extremely intelligent, and immediately tried to probe the flower. “Greetings, senior. We’ve found our way here by accident, and we don’t know where this place is. We didn’t want to provoke or offend you, and I hope that you can forgive us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, so that’s what happened! It’s nothing much, I can forgive you.” It was easy to talk to this giant pink flower, and the fiery-red flowers that were floating in the sky returned to the red side of the lake and disappeared as she spoke. The pressure that Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er had faced before vanished in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t lower his guard even though it was easy to talk to this large pink flower. He asked once more, “Senior, I don’t know where we are. Since you can speak the human language, why do you say that you’re not a hundred-thousand year soul beast?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The large pink flower replied, “This place is called the Icefire Yin Yang Well. That person says that this place is one of the world’s Three Great Cornucopias. Since the two of you are here by accident, then please leave as quickly as you can. You are lucky to have met me. If you had run into the other short-tempered fellows, they would probably have killed you on the spot as fertilizer. However, I haven’t seen humans for a long time, and I’m very happy to see you guys here today. Quick, talk to me, and I might even consider giving you some benefits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Huo Yuhao’s mouth twitched, because he realized to his surprise that this amiable enormous pink flower actually liked to nag!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright! Let me accompany you in conversation, then. The empty space around you should be considered safe, right? I haven’t asked yet, senior, what is your name?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The large flower tilted as if it were a human head that was deep in thought. “That person says that I’m a medicinal herb, and he calls me the Delicate Silk Immortal. You can call me You You.. yes, that name sounds good. Does it sound good?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, it sounds really good.” Huo Yuhao hurriedly followed the large flower’s conversation. He was thinking about something else. This flower was known as the Delicate Silk Immortal, so she should also be a medicinal herb? An immortal herb, and a herb that had already evolved into a plant-type soul beast...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You haven’t told me yet, senior. Why do you say that you’re not a hundred-thousand year soul beast?” Huo Yuhao immediately fired off another question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal giggled and said, “That’s because I haven’t lived to a hundred thousand years of age. I’m only ten thousand years old. Actually, I’m a little more than ten thousand years old, but I can’t really remember anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er beside Huo Yuhao blurted out, “That’s impossible! How can you be only ten thousand years old? If you’re just ten thousand years old, it’d be impossible for you to have enough consciousness and intelligence to evolve into a plant-type soul beast. Furthermore, you can already speak!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You You spoke with obvious pride. “I’m sure you didn’t know this, but even though I’m not a hundred-thousand year soul beast, my abilities have reached that level. The Icefire Yin Yang Well nourishes us, so the plants that live here grow ten times faster than the plants in the outside world. That is the reason why I’m just ten thousand years old, but I’m equivalent to a hundred-thousand year plant. You humans are quite stupid, eh.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Astonishment! You You made it sound so casual, but both Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er were full of surprise and awe as they heard this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day spent in this place was equivalent to ten days in the outside world. Plant-type soul beasts could grow ten times faster than if they were outside – what a terrifying number! That also meant that there were probably a lot more plant-type soul beasts in this place than they had initially thought, and they were probably far more frightening at the same time. It was just as the Delicate Silk Immortal had said, that it was their good fortune that they came to her before going anywhere else. No – Niu Tian’s guidance in his letter had saved them, because if they had gone somewhere else and encountered another short-tempered and aggressive hundred-thousand year plant-type soul beast, they would probably have been dead by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, why aren’t you guys talking anymore? Say something, guys. Chat with me, quickly! If not, I may decide to stop protecting you. Without my protection, even the plants and the Icefire Yin Yang Well’s aura will harm you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thoughts spun in Huo Yuhao’s head, and he quickly came to a decision. He bowed respectfully towards the Delicate Silk Immortal and said, “I’m sorry, You You, I’ve lied to you, and I am now apologizing to you. The truth is that we didn’t come here by accident, and we’re here for a purpose. Someone wants me to come here to find a book. Have you seen this book?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal’s enormous flower suddenly began to sway vigorously from side to side. “Ah, ah, ah! So you have been sent by that person. It’s actually him! How is he? I haven’t seen him for so long, and he doesn’t often come back to see everyone. Tsk, tsk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Truthfully, Huo Yuhao didn’t know who “he” was referring to. Was it referring to Wang Dong’er’s father or Niu Tian?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He… he should be alright. Is that book really with you?” Huo Yuhao continued to probe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, yes. It is.” The purple stamen in the flower’s center began to sway rhythmically, and an ancient book that was crafted from some unknown material drifted into view.</span></p>

E</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">very single one of uncle Niu Tian’s words have turned out to be true. I just didn’t expect this book to be protected by a hundred-thousand year plant-type soul beast. That’s incredible! Is the Clear Sky Sect actually that powerful?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao still didn’t know what other plants there were inside this place, but he was absolutely certain that this valley was filled with exotic entities and resources. Any plant here grew ten times faster than they normally would... what kind of principle was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you give it to me, You You? Thank you.” Huo Yuhao began to feel excited as he realized that he could possibly retrieve the medicinal herb that could save Wang Dong’er’s life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No can do. I’ve been protecting it for ten thousand years, so how can I give it to you so easily?” You You’s answer made it sound as if she couldn’t bear to part with that book.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ten… ten thousand years?!” Huo Yuhao was stunned on the spot. He suddenly realized that the person that had left this book behind, the person that You You was speaking of, wasn’t Niu Tian, and neither was it Dong’er’s father.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who could that be? Ten thousand years! He left this book here for ten thousand years? That’s almost impossible to believe...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes! It’s been ten thousand years. That person said that this book can only be given to his descendant, or to someone with the right destiny. Furthermore, his descendants have to undergo a test before they can claim this book. You have to do two things if you want this book: you have to prove that you’re his descendant, and then you have to pass the test. Only then can you take it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao asked confusedly, “How can I prove that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal’s voice became a little solemn as she said, “It’s quite dangerous if you want to prove yourself. If you are unsuccessful, then you might die; that’s the rule he left behind. He said that this place is almost like heaven on earth, and we can never let evil humans know about this place. Those that are pretending to be his descendants will have to die. I will definitely not kill you, but it’s hard to say the same about the other guys. Are you sure you want to prove that you’re his descendant?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt his heart skip a beat. He understood that the Delicate Silk Immortal was speaking the truth. Plant-type soul beasts could be in every corner of this place, and he probably wouldn’t even have a chance to run if they all attacked him at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s calm and composure paid off at this moment. He pondered momentarily before he said, “You You, can you tell me how I can prove that I’m his descendant? Someone directed me here, but I do not know whether I am his descendant. I don’t wish to die, so can you tell me how I can prove that I’m his descendant? This way, I will be surer of myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, alright. You have to eat an herb to test if you’re his descendant. If you survive after ingesting it, that proves that you’re his descendant, and if you die, that means you’re not.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah?” Huo Yuhao had never expected the test to be like that. There weren’t any hints or clues at all! It would be truly regrettable if he died from rashly eating some herb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What herb is it?” Huo Yuhao pressed the issue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal shook her large flower and said, “I can’t tell you that. If you decide to take this test, then I will bring it to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No! You can’t do it.” Wang Qiu’er exclaimed almost without hesitation, and she grabbed Huo Yuhao’s arm while she stared at him anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao turned around to her, and his eyes were full of complicated emotions. “It’s likely that I will succeed, Qiu’er. Even though I don’t know what this thing about descendants is about, and I don’t know who the person who left this book behind ten thousand years ago was, I know that obtaining this book is the only way I can find the medicinal herb to save Dong’er’s life. Uncle Niu Tian directed me here, and I trust that he won’t harm me. He must think that I’m a descendant of the person that left this book behind, and so he has assigned this task to me. Therefore, I am fifty percent certain that I will be fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No! Absolutely not.” Wang Qiu’er’s words were decisive. “Fifty percent? The other fifty percent will cost you your life, don’t you know that? Do you think it’s worth it for you to die just like that? I can tell you that every single plant in this place is sophisticated, and I have studied plant-type soul beasts before. However, I do not recognize more than two-thirds of the plants in this place. Your chances of survival don’t even stand at fifty percent, I don’t even think you have a thirty percent chance to survive. If you die, I…”</span></p>

His eyes seemed a little vacant, and he was looking up diagonally into the sky, as if he were thinking about something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, Huo Yuhao was thinking, and he was thinking about Wang Dong’er.</span></p>

However, he didn’t have to investigate anything, and she revealed her gender to him during the Sea God’s Fate.</span></p>
