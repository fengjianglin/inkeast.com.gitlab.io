Furthermore, everything in front of him turned blurry the moment it appeared. The White Tiger Duke and his bodyguards immediately became very unclear. If they were so unclear, how could Ye Yulin lock onto Dai Hao?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t the only one who felt that way. All the soul engineers had the same feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Idiot, you are courting death! Turn him into waste!” Ye Yulin shouted. Countless soul rays instantly streamed towards the golden vertical eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these soul rays were still dozens of meters away from the vertical eye, the vertical eye instantly transformed into bubbles and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, its appearance had also caused the two soul engineer legions to stop. Before the soul engineers were even able to react, the rose-gold vertical eye silently appeared again in mid-air after the soul rays passed through it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s going on? Even if this is an illusion, it has to be created by a soul master! Why is it able to vanish on its own just as it’s about to be attacked, and reappear after that? What kind of ability is this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, they didn’t know that this was what Huo Yuhao was capable of after his spiritual power reached the concrete-material realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rose-gold vertical eye was created by Huo Yuhao, but it wasn’t just an illusion. As long as Huo Yuhao was willing, he could make it real. In fact, all the illusions that had affected them earlier were created by this vertical eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The greatest difference between the concrete-material and concrete-immaterial realm was that spiritual power in the concrete-immaterial realm could only spawn a spiritual avatar that could detect and survey things, but not do anything concrete. Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power in the concrete-material realm was an extension of his own body. Within a certain region, this extension of his body possessed some of his powers. Huo Yuhao could retract this extension with just a thought. As he released and retracted this extension, he managed to slow the advance of the two soul engineer legions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t possibly beat the Starsky Douluo in a duel. However, he was able to use all sorts of confusing tactics through his spiritual power and Spirit Eyes. On such a huge battlefield, capturing him would be very difficult. As long as Huo Yuhao didn’t risk his life, it would take a Transcendent Douluo to lock onto him with his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Others might be afraid of Ye Yulin’s Sunmoon Divine Needle, but Huo Yuhao wasn’t. His Sunmoon Divine Needle couldn’t lock onto Huo Yuhao unless the Evileye Tyrant King was helping Ye Yulin accurately target him. The best way of targeting Huo Yuhao was a powerful area of effect attack or a soul tool, and would also depend on one’s own cultivation. However, Huo Yuhao could predict things. Even in the face of such situations, he could still choose to flee. While his fighting strength wasn’t anything much on a battlefield, his survival skills were much better than most Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, using his spiritual power in the concrete-material realm was still quite draining. After all, Huo Yuhao was the only one apart from Ultimate Douluo and those with the same spiritual cultivation who could use his spiritual power to unleash a soul skill. In terms of spiritual cultivation, Huo Yuhao could compare to an ordinary spiritual-type Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the rose-gold vertical eye appeared once again, things turned blurry in front of the Starsky Douluo yet again. His expression also turned serious, and his fury grew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Given his experience, how could he not tell that this person didn’t want to fight it out with him? They wouldn’t have performed so many tricks if otherwise. Given the two soul engineer legions he had with him, he was confident of fighting an Ultimate Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Yulin snorted and said, “Blow up the entire region straight ahead and between five hundred and a thousand meters away. Make sure the angle covered is a hundred and eighty degrees. Find that guy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under his command, all the soul engineers started to move. They changed their soul rays to soul cannons, and explosive shells quickly filled the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Yulin revealed a cold smile.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I don’t believe I can’t blow this entire place up and make you appear. You have to be within range in order to use your soul skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The region he had ordered the soul engineer legions to cover was extensive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tremendous booms that ensued turned the sky completely red. The energy storm generated from the explosions raged out, and terrifying lights flashed. Every time they flashed, the air would start to distort furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had already turned back and fled the moment Ye Yulin ordered the two soul engineer legions. Ye Yulin was simply too vicious, and Yuhao couldn’t possibly handle such an attack. Once he was stuck in the explosions, his Imitation was bound to be overcome. Given the abilities of Ye Yulin and all the Class 8 and 9 soul engineers with him, Huo Yuhao would be wasted by their advanced soul tools the moment his position was exposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had no choice but to flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the explosions ensued, seven to eight figures also quickly flew out from the two soul engineer legions. They advanced in different directions as they pursued the retreating White Tiger bodyguards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These soul engineers were some of the strongest in the Sun Moon Empire. Naturally, they understood what the most effective way to deal with an illusion was. They had caught a fleeting glimpse of the black doors earlier. Although they didn’t know what those doors were, they could roughly guess that their pursuit would be unsuccessful once these White Tiger bodyguards entered those doors. They had to stop them from retreating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t return to the White Tiger Duke’s side. Under such circumstances, he knew that they could only prevail by surprise, and delaying the incoming soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke was fearless even against the handful of soul engineers that were advancing towards them. He flew into the sky, and his third and fifth soul rings shone brightly, bringing up his White Tiger’s Vajra Transformation and White Tiger’s Devilgod Transformation. His body instantly grew to more than three meters in height, and his muscles bulged. His dominating aura, along with his strong killing intent, welcomed the incoming soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the seven soul engineers, three of them were Class 9 soul engineers, including Ye Yulin. The remaining four were Class 8 soul engineers. If these soul engineers weren’t equipped with soul tools, they wouldn’t be able to compare to the White Tiger Duke given the strength of their martial souls. Even if the White Tiger Duke couldn’t challenge all of them, his strength was still close to their combined abilities. Advanced soul engineers devoted their energy towards soul tool research, and thus their individual fighting strength was pretty weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Yulin flew at the center of the group. The Sunmoon Divine Needle above him had also already started charging. He knew that the White Tiger Duke wasn’t going to be easy to deal with. Without his destructive Sunmoon Divine Needle, they wouldn’t be able to kill Dai Hao quickly. If the others were able to stall Dai Hao and he dealt the fatal blow, things would be settled. As for the hidden enemy, his position would immediately be revealed the moment he dared to appear. He would also be killed. Right now, both Sunmoon Divine Needles were charging!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Yulin didn’t know that this strategy would get him into huge trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A figure was silently creeping up on him. In terms of soul tools, Ye Yulin was one of the strongest in the entire continent. However, his senses weren’t any better than an ordinary Titled Douluo, while the person who was creeping closer to him was the Eye of the Asura, whose spiritual power had shocked even the Beast God, Di Tian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao knew the goal of these soul engineers. As long as Dai Hao was still around, they wouldn’t give up their attacks on him. To save the White Tiger Duke, the best way was to fight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Huo Yuhao was following behind Ye Yulin. He didn’t use any soul tools to aid him in flying, but his own cultivation. While Ye Yulin was flying very quickly, he still flew behind the other soul engineers, as he needed to charge his Sunmoon Divine Needle and locate Dai Hao. He was the rearmost point of their encirclement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao estimated his spiritual power. Under the effect of his Imitation, he believed that he wouldn’t be discovered even if he got within fifty meters of Ye Yulin. If he inched any closer, however, he was unsure of what would happen. Furthermore, he also believed that Ye Yulin had already taken precautions against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Starsky Douluo posed the greatest threat to him and the White Tiger Duke of all these soul engineers. The offensive power of the Starsky Douluo’s Sunmoon Divine Needle was simply too scary. Many Titled Douluo were unable to handle the power of even a single strike from his Sunmoon Divine Needle. They only had a chance of escaping if they settled the Starsky Douluo first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Huo Yuhao was fifty meters away, he stopped inching closer. Instead, he silently followed the Starsky Douluo as he drew closer to Dai Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order to not draw fire on his subordinates, Dai Hao had already flown into the sky. These soul engineers had no issue with the White Tiger bodyguards escaping. They were content as long as the White Tiger Duke was killed. As the soul engineers drew closer to Dai Hao, Ye Yulin’s Sunmoon Divine Needle was about to finish charging.</span></p>
