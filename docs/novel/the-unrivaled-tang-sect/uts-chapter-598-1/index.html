<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The army was now getting a lot closer to the Sun Moon Empire’s border. However, their morale was extremely low. None of the commanders were in a good mood, and such things were extremely infectious. Hence, even the soldiers below them were feeling it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the army had secured multiple victories on this campaign, they were feeling very displeased after problems had emerged internally within the army. This was a common sentiment shared by the soul engineers and the commanders. One could only imagine how furious they must have felt to encounter these things when a golden opportunity for them to leave their names in the history books had shown itself. They couldn’t wait to skin the entire Holy Ghost Church alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was naturally a lot more composed than the rest. She was sitting in her carriage, but she would occasionally lift the curtains to glimpse at what was outside. Her eyes would naturally drift to where Huo Yuhao—who was wearing a female outfit—was. Even though her face would not give off any hint of emotion, Huo Yuhao would still be able to tell from her eyes that she was laughing deep down inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time that Huo Yuhao was being punished in this manner. In fact, Ju Zi was not only the one laughing at Huo Yuhao! Tang Wutong would also burst into laughter periodically—even though she had already been warned many times by the soul engineer who was in charge of military discipline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, while Huo Yuhao was very frustrated by the punishment he had received, Ju Zi was actually very happy about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Huo Yuhao had recently caused her a lot of trouble and had enraged her multiple times, the displeasure in her heart was gradually being melted by his mere presence beside her. In fact, she wished that this road they were traveling on would never end. At the very least, this would mean that he would be able to stay by her side. She felt good just seeing him every day. Ju Zi wondered why she didn’t feel the same way when they were back in the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The speed at which the army was moving definitely could not be compared to that of a soul engineer legion. Even then, the Sun Moon Empire’s troops were able to fast march at a quicker pace than the other empires’ troops. Within five days, the border between the Sun Moon Empire and what was originally the Heavenly Soul Empire was now within sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi chose to reorganize her troops at an area close to the border of the Heavenly Soul Empire. After getting her troops to set up camp at that area, she gave out an order to the surrounding cities to resupply the army with rations and other supplies. The army was to rest up at that area while they waited for her next orders. In the meantime, she brought the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion, as well as the remaining soul engineers from the Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion and the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion, with her back to Radiant City. The Class 9 soul engineers from the Imperial Consecration Hall also followed her back to the capital of the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that she had planned to confront the Holy Ghost Church, Ju Zi would definitely bring along all the manpower she had. Even though two of the three beast lord-ranked soul engineer legions were no longer what they used to be, she still effectively had two soul engineer legions when all their manpower was combined. At the same time, she had quite a few Class 9 soul engineers with her. They would definitely be able to protect themselves even if they were to bump into an Ultimate Douluo like Ye Xishui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were flying not too far away from Ju Zi. After all, they were supposed to be her personal guards. Right now, Huo Yuhao was definitely feeling uncomfortable in the human-shaped soul tool, which did not fit very well with his body. Even though he knew it was mainly psychological rather than physical discomfort, he still could not help but feel frustrated with his outfit. He was constantly trying to release his Ultimate Ice aura to counter the fire-type elemental fluctuations which were coming from the human-shaped soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiao Yu, can you come over here?” Ju Zi, who was flying in the air, suddenly turned around and waved at Huo Yuhao. Xiao Yu was the name she had given him. Every soul engineer from the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion knew that their Marshal liked Xiao Yu a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The selection criteria for the soul engineers within the soul engineer legions were very strict. This was especially true for the Marshal’s personal guards. Because Ju Zi was the one who was supposed to handpick her personal guards, no one knew Xiao Yu’s background. In fact, they did not even know what she looked like, as she was always wearing her human-shaped soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao flew towards Ju Zi unwillingly before transmitting a message. “What’s the matter with you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi lifted her visor as she moved closer to Huo Yuhao before flashing him a mesmerizing smile. “I’m hungry. I need you to prepare a meal for me. I heard your family has passed down a recipe for delicious grilled fish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, I won’t!” Huo Yuhao replied coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was not the first time that Ju Zi had tried to make his life difficult. Ever since he had become her personal guard, she had made all sorts of difficult requests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao knew that she was only doing these to get closer to him. However, this was precisely why he was very wary of her. In fact, Huo Yuhao was very against giving in to her demands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Huo Yuhao heard Tang Wutong’s voice in his ears. “Go ahead and grill the fish for her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was startled, and turned around to look at Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was still flying in a very relaxed manner. It did not seem like she was angry at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When did she become so magnanimous? Is she still the Tang Wutong I know?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a bit doubtful about her words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s really fine. I really don’t mind. However, you must tell her that I want a share of the grilled fish. I really miss the grilled fish you used to make.” Tang Wutong revealed her true intentions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seems like this girl is also craving some food.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to his attitude towards Ju Zi, Huo Yuhao was very willing to prepare grilled fish for Tang Wutong. As long as that was what she wanted, Huo Yuhao would definitely do his best to satisfy her wants.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi frowned and replied, "If you can't even fulfill such a small request, how do you expect me to cooperate with you?" This was not the first time she had used this to threaten him. However, it was undeniable that it was fairly effective.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao had also given clear rejections if the request was too much. Hence, Ju Zi did not have high hopes that he would agree to her every single request.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, much to her surprise, Huo Yuhao actually nodded after hesitating for a short while. "Alright. But Wutong and I must get a share of the fish too." He purposely added himself into the picture just so that Ju Zi would not reject his condition outright.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sure." Ju Zi replied without any hesitation. Huo Yuhao could tell that she was over the moon from the look in her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this really necessary just to eat a few grilled fish? Is she still the invincible War God Empress I know?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An hour later, Ju Zi ordered the group to settle down by a huge river. Catching fish was a piece of cake for soul engineers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, several fresh fish were presented in front of Ju Zi. The generals and soul engineers had all settled down at a place which was fairly far from where she was. After all, it was best if both genders could stay in different rest areas. Hence, Ju Zi would not have to share the food Huo Yuhao was about to prepare.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Huo Yuhao was wearing the human-shaped soul tool, he could only use the exposed part of his hands to prepare the fish. He was able to clean the fish and remove their scales in a short amount of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was already very familiar with the grilling process. He was able to set up a rack in no time. Very soon, the two ladies could smell the scent of grilled fish.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi naturally took the first fish. After taking her first bite, she could not help but look up to compliment Huo Yuhao. Her eyes widened in disbelief as he nodded furiously to express her satisfaction with Huo Yuhao's grilled fish.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second fish was offered to Tang Wutong. She simply sat by the side and enjoyed the fish Huo Yuhao had grilled for her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was common knowledge that women tend to have a greater appetite than men when it came to good food. Both ladies devoured Huo Yuhao's grilled fish like nobody's business.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps it was because of her greater fighting power, but Tang Wutong seemed to have a greater appetite than Ju Zi. While Tang Wutong was still grabbing the next grilled fish, Ju Zi was already full.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this time, Huo Yuhao had also eaten a few grilled fish. However, he really did not have to eat much at his current cultivation. Even if he were to go without eating anything for a few days, he would still be perfectly fine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi leaned on a huge tree behind her as she glanced at Tang Wutong, who was sitting not too far away from her. "Are you not jealous that he is making grilled fish for me to eat?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong shook her head as she continued to eat her grilled fish happily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao walked towards her before wiping the oil at the corner of her mouth with a clean handkerchief. Tang Wutong looked up and flashed a blissful smile at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Ju Zi was not able to see Huo Yuhao's expression because of the visor on his face, she could still imagine the loving look in his eyes. She couldn't help but remark jealously, "I can't believe you're not jealous at all. I think you don't know how to cherish your man. If Huo Yuhao were my man instead, I would definitely not allow him to prepare food for another woman!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong shook her head and smiled at Ju Zi. "This is really nothing. Besides, the stuff he gives me is always different from what he gives others."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Different? How is it different?" As one would have expected of Ju Zi, she had been paying close attention to the way Huo Yuhao had been grilling the fish. She made sure that he had followed the exact same procedure for both their fish. Hence, she did not believe what Tang Wutong had just said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong extended the grilled fish in her hands to Ju Zi and said, "Since you like him so much, why don't you try the fish he gave me?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, she retraced her arm and peeled off a chunk of fish for Ju Zi. Tang Wutong had decided not to be so magnanimous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi took the piece of fish from Tang Wutong suspiciously. Her rationality told her that she should not be eating the leftovers of a commoner as the powerful War God Empress. However, the curiosity and affection within her ultimately won her over as she stuffed the piece into her mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took Ju Zi only a few bites for her to be stunned by the flavor. She sat still as she stared blankly at the space before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flavor in her mouth was simply out of this world! The fish meat was tender and juicy. It seemed to possess some sort of special energy. Even though its flavor was more or less similar to that of the meat she ate earlier, this special energy was what made the meat so special. It was almost as if the entire grilled fish had been enhanced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the meantime, Tang Wutong continued to eat her grilled fish. She still had the same blissful look on her face as she savored every bite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was stunned for a good long while before she finally swallowed the fish in her mouth. At that instant, she felt an immense satisfaction overwhelm her entire body. She felt as though she was being brought into a warm and loving embrace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“W-What did you add to her grilled fish?” Ju Zi turned her head and asked Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao spoke plainly, “You’ve been watching me while I was grilling the fish. You should know well enough that I did not vary my procedure because of Tang Wutong or you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, why is the flavor different? In fact, it tastes so much better. I don’t care. I want that kind of fish too.” Ju Zi spoke viciously.</span></p>
