 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So fierce?” Huo Yuhao finally understood why the Snow Empress said she could see hope in the future from his strength. If he could possess power like Di Tian’s, that meant he would be at the pinnacle of the world. When that happened, as long as he could obtain the Godly Seat, then becoming a God would be the most natural outcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So that’s it. I understand. Thank you, Snow Lady.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged sincerely. The Snow Lady was both teacher and friend to him now. She had been immensely helpful to him ever since she had truly awakened, both on the battlefield and in teaching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress grunted and said, “There’s no need for thanks. Even though I did say that you can relax when you should, you can’t go overboard with that. You have to work hard at what you need to do. Alright, go and get Little Bai. I figure he’s probably starving.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt his heart skip a beat. Wasn’t that right? So many days had gone by, and yet he hadn’t given Little Bai anything to eat.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right, there’s still Big Mao and Second Mao too. They’re still in my spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao allowed the Snow Lady to return to his body as he left the room. He found Nan Qiuqiu before he released Big Mao and Second Mao so that she could take them to get something to eat. He quickly ran out of the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao quickly found the Ice Bear King, Little Bai, with the Snow Empress’ guidance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King was still at a small river not far from Shrek City, and he was napping without a care. He was still in human form with his enormous and protruding belly, and he dipped his hands into the river water from time to time. He didn’t even have to look, yet he grabbed a fish or two with every dip before he tossed them into his mouth and swallowed them with a few bites.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But how many small fish could there be outside the city? Furthermore, they weren’t very big, and Huo Yuhao could tell from his lazy demeanor that his appetite was clearly unsatiated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Bai!” Huo Yuhao found him with Spiritual Detection from far away and hurriedly called out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King sprang to his feet when he heard Huo Yuhao’s voice. He moved deceptively fast as he looked in Huo Yuhao’s direction with an expression of pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was suspicious about whether this fellow was staring at him so passionately and eagerly because he was hungry, or because he was starting to miss him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re here, grandfather. I’m starving!” Little Bai was almost stammering as he spoke. He even put his hands into his clothes as he put on a very pitiful look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared at him as he shook his head in exasperation. If this were made known to the public, who would believe that this “man” was one of the strongest savage beasts in the Extreme North!? He looked just like a hungry little child with that aggrieved expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, alright. Eat your fill.” Huo Yuhao took out a pile of dried meat and fish from his storage-type soul tool for the Ice Bear King to eat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had his own plans. He wanted to bring this fellow back after feeding him. Otherwise, when he began to eat his fill inside the Tang Sect, he would probably astonish the entire Tang Sect. He might possibly even cause mass panic and hysteria!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no doubt that Huo Yuhao wanted to bring the Ice Bear King with him on his coming expedition to the front lines. He had worked together with him twice now, and understood quite a bit about his strength from those experiences. Furthermore, his teamwork with the Ice Bear King and their combined fighting strength was very effective, especially in limiting the Sun Moon Empire’s aerial surveillance soul tools. The Ice Bear King was someone who could rival a Transcendent Douluo’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King couldn’t be bothered with anything else as long as he had something to eat. He just sat down and gobbled his food up in elation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King patted his stomach after munching for a good hour. Was it strange that this fellow immediately became so energetic and lively once he was full? Huo Yuhao was rendered speechless as he looked on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where are we going now, grandfather?” the Ice Bear King immediately asked Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress immediately came out from Huo Yuhao with a flash of white light and appeared in front of the Ice Bear King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mother!” The Ice Bear King immediately lay prostrate on the ground when he saw her, and called out to her intimately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress blushed and said, “Don’t call me mother. Address me as Snow Empress next time.” She turned towards Huo Yuhao and asked, “Yuhao, do you plan to fuse with him right now, or a little while later?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao understood what she was trying to say. “Are you saying that my soul power has reached Rank 80?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress nodded and replied, “Even though you’ve only just reached that stage, you are actually at Rank 80. You should have no problem absorbing another soul ring, and that’s the same with a Spirit. Little Bai won’t resist you in any way, and after he becomes your Spirit, your soul power will be boosted by at least another two ranks because you have Ultimate Ice. A normal soul master’s soul power would be boosted by at least four or five ranks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was astonished when he heard her words. Soul masters needed to accumulate much more soul power to raise their soul power by another rank after reaching Rank 80. A soul master reached a different stage after every ten ranks, and the journey after reaching Rank 80 had been called the path to heaven. Becoming a Titled Douluo was heaven, but how easy could it be to move towards becoming a Titled Douluo?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that wasn’t too surprising. Little Bai was a savage beast with more than two hundred thousand years of cultivation. Huo Yuhao would definitely receive a great boost in his cultivation after absorbing the Ice Bear King as a Spirit. He could even raise his soul power by two ranks even with his Ultimate Ice. That was strength that belonged to a Soul Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hesitated, but then shook his head and said, “Snow Lady, I can’t bear to leave him. Is it really appropriate that he becomes my Spirit?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled and said, “You don’t have to hesitate about that. I wouldn’t have been so certain last time. Have you forgotten what I just told you? Even I have seen hope in you, so you fusing with Little Bai is good for him. He won’t disappear because of that anyway, and his consciousness will still be around. Even if you ask Ah Tai to do this, he would be willing to grab such an opportunity. This is an opportunity that soul beasts like us can only dream of. Therefore, you don’t have to deliberate at all. Little Bai will definitely be willing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, yes. I’m willing, I’m willing.” Little Bai chimed in from the side without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao thought to himself in exasperation,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Bai, oh Little Bai. You must have no idea what we’re talking about, and you’re just in a hurry to profess your loyalty. But this fellow is so cutely straightforward and honest. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao contemplated for a moment, then said, “Snow Empress, I think I’m not going to fuse with Little Bai for now. I am about to go to the front lines, where the Sun Moon Empire and the Heavenly Soul Empire are locked in battle. Little Bai’s support will be very important for us there. Let’s wait until after our expedition. Furthermore, my soul power has just reached Rank 80, and my cultivation isn’t stable or consolidated yet. I’m not in a hurry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress replied, “That’s up to you, then, as Little Bai can do it anytime. Bring him along, and you can fuse with him whenever you feel the need to. External strength is not as important as your own strength no matter how powerful it is. Furthermore, I can feel that Little Bai is becoming increasingly close to his day of tribulation. Take him along, and you can absorb him as your Spirit as soon as you feel that something is amiss.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao tilted his head and said, “Alright. We’ll rescue teacher Xiao Ya, and then I’ll fuse with Little Bai immediately afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took the Ice Bear King back to the Tang Sect. He emphasized to Little Bai once more not to address him as “grandfather” before entering the Tang Sect, and Little Bai was like a curious baby as he asked questions nonstop. In the end, Huo Yuhao told him that he wouldn’t give him food to eat if he continued asking, and only then did he quiet down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh, who’s that, Master?” Huo Yuhao ran into Na Na as soon as he stepped into the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several years had gone by, and Na Na’s spirit and liveliness were vastly different from when she had first met Huo Yuhao. Na Na was both pretty and capable today, and she worked as a butler to the Tang Sect. Her status within the Tang Sect had grown exponentially, but the only characteristic that she couldn’t shake off was that she would always address Huo Yuhao as “master” every time they met. Huo Yuhao was too lazy to correct her after a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is my friend,” Huo Yuhao introduced the Ice Bear King to Na Na.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Na Na smiled at the Ice Bear King and said, “Welcome to the Tang Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King stared at Na Na and said, “Hello, pretty lady.” He had almost never had any contact with humans before, and he almost began to drool when he saw the beautiful Na Na.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had arranged a series of jobs because he was in a hurry to rescue Tang Ya. He had gathered the Tang Sect’s senior-level individuals for a meeting, and they had to discuss who was to participate in this operation. He was the eldest senior brother, but the Tang Sect’s internal affairs and atmosphere had always been harmonious.</span></p>

There was a tinge of bitterness in his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei chuckled and said, “Don’t be hasty, Caitou. By rights, I should let you go out to take a walk, but you know about our situation in the Tang Sect. Teacher Xuan can’t deal with everything by himself, and you are the best with soul tools next to our little junior brother. I am most assured with you directing things. You are stable, and I have decided to let you take over my role temporarily. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou seemed a little depressed as he shook his head. “No. Let me go, eldest senior brother. Why don’t you have little junior brother remain? He’s better than me at everything. With him around, everything within the Tang Sect will be dealt with neatly and impeccably. He hasn’t been staying within our walls for quite some time, and he’s always running into danger when he’s outside. I think we should let him calm down a little inside the Tang Sect, and he can also help relieve your burdens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t backstab me, second senior brother!” Huo Yuhao chimed in with a laugh.</span></p>
