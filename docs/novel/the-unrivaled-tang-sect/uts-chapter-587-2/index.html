 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the light from the golden trident on Tang Wutong’s forehead retracted. After this, the light that had scattered earlier immediately gathered together before shooting towards Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Golden light shone as the Eye of Destiny was hit. Huo Yuhao only felt his entire body shaking tremendously. He actually felt a strong suction force that was sucking his spiritual core out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stable circulation of his spiritual soul core was disrupted, and its revolution became violently quick. This caused Huo Yuhao’s entire head to turn golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the castle, all the clouds within a fifty kilometer radius shone with the same glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao tried to focus his gaze, but all he saw was that the golden light came from Tang Wutong’s golden trident. This suction force was like a bridge between him and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There wasn’t any reluctance on his part. Huo Yuhao did his best to use his spiritual power to push his spiritual core outward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to know that his was a Yin-Yang Complement soul core. Once it completely left his body, his Ultimate Ice soul core might actually blow apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had already thought this over properly. He believed that Tai Tan also didn’t know the characteristics of his Yin-Yang Complement soul cores. This was why he judged the outcome in that manner. In fact, from the current situation, his Ultimate Ice soul core might immediately blow apart the moment his spiritual soul core left his body. When that happened, his entire body might actually explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought of this potential outcome, Huo Yuhao also thought of a way to counteract it. Giving his spiritual soul core to Tang Wutong could save her. That was enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was also very self-confident. He was confident that he could control his Ultimate Ice soul core for at least a short period of time. If he was given time to recite incantations, that would be enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If that happened, he would open his spectral door and enter his demiplane before shutting the door. He would then blow apart in his own demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He might destroy the entire demiplane if he blew apart in there. Perhaps he might only destroy a part of it. He was fine with it as long as he didn’t harm anyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was what he thought. It was very simple and direct. This was why he decisively chose to listen to Tai Tan’s suggestion. When he came to save Tang Wutong, he had already expected death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If only one of the two of them could survive, he naturally wished that it was Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dim lights flashed in the air. The golden light that was shining from Huo Yuhao’s body became stronger and stronger. As his spiritual soul core shifted out, the chain between his two soul cores was also pulled longer and longer. The circulation speed of his Ultimate Ice soul core also got faster and faster. It seemed like it was going to turn violent soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao perfectly demonstrated his control right now. He suppressed both his soul cores and contained their violent tendencies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Eye of Destiny had turned into a golden whirlpool by now. Even the pupil was gone. Against the golden trident, the golden light that it let out also became more and more intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Project!” A gentle voice sounded. Huo Yuhao could only tell that this voice didn’t belong to Tai Tan. It didn’t seem to belong to Niu Tian either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this, Huo Yuhao felt a gentle beam of light striking his body. This beam of light felt warm, but there was an indescribable pressure that came with it. The pressure he was under earlier re-surfaced. It was even stronger now than it was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was astonished. However, before he could even react, he felt his soul and spiritual power pouring out of his body. Following this, his spiritual soul core shook a little. Huo Yuhao only felt a strong turning force, and a sense of weakness immediately swept over his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A golden whirlpool appeared thirty centimeters in front of him. Wasn’t that his spiritual soul core?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao was stunned that his spiritual soul core didn’t disappear. It was still in his Eye of Destiny. It was just that its spiritual aura was weaker than what it was previously. It was at most only at one-tenth of what it was earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One-tenth of an Ultimate Douluo’s spiritual power was still close to the standard of a Rank 90 Titled Douluo. However, the sense of weakness was still very overwhelming, as Huo Yuhao lost ninety percent of his spiritual power so abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a torturous feeling. At least this was what Huo Yuhao was feeling right now. His Ultimate Ice soul core also became stronger. The center of the chain connecting both soul cores was where both soul cores collided with each other, generating whirlpool-like soul power. However, it was rapidly shifting upward, and only stabilized after entering Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His two soul cores became a little unbalanced now. The whirlpool-like soul power that he generated contained the chill of Ultimate Ice, while his spiritual aura had evidently weakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was going on? Why was a part of his soul core able to be separated? Ninety-ten separation?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Projection? Earlier, that voice mentioned something about projection. What’s that? Is this the secret method of the Clear Sky Sect? It’s magical!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Huo Yuhao was weak, he could still clearly see that the golden whirlpool was drifting in the air towards Tang Wutong, along the trajectory of the golden light released by the golden trident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t moving at an incredible speed, but it was very stable. It seemed to have completely detached itself from Huo Yuhao’s control. He couldn’t even sense that part of his spiritual power. The circulation speed of his spiritual soul core also fell considerably. Just like Tai Tan had mentioned, his spiritual soul core had become extremely weak right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Focus. When Wutong absorbs your spiritual soul core, she’ll interact with the soul power that you poured into her body. At the same time, she’ll stimulate the resonance of your spiritual soul core. You must be careful. If you can’t control your soul and spiritual power, you’ll become an idiot. Do you understand?” Tai Tan’s voice sounded once again. Yes, it was Tai Tan’s voice this time. Huo Yuhao was certain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Huo Yuhao naturally couldn’t say anything. He quickly focused, and did his best to tolerate the intense weakness. He also tried his best to sense the changes to the soul and spiritual power in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden whirlpool slowly came in front of Tang Wutong until it reached her golden trident. After this, the whirlpool stopped there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was illuminated golden. Huo Yuhao could clearly sense that the soul power undulations in her body had become stronger. His soul power inside his body was also circulating according to these intense undulations, and was quickly being sucked by away Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it were someone else, he might really think that Tang Wutong was sucking his power away to strengthen herself. At least, this method seemed like it was doing that. It was similar to an evil soul master’s abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao didn’t think so. He would have no regrets even if he gave everything to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why he didn’t resist at all. He relaxed completely, and let Tang Wutong absorb his soul power. Tang Wutong’s passageways became brighter and brighter as they were strengthened by soul power. The aura of death in her body seemed to realize that the situation wasn’t good, and started to struggle in her body. However, it couldn’t cause any damage, as it faced Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s combined soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden whirlpool in front of Tang Wutong’s golden trident became smaller. Or rather, it was slowly being absorbed into Tang Wutong’s body through the golden trident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately sensed that the soul core in Tang Wutong’s dantian was surging. Immense soul power was shooting towards her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very familiar with such a feeling. When he first cultivated his Yin-Yang Complement soul cores, didn’t he face something like this? He only escaped death with Elder Mu and his Six Spirits’ help, and became the first human in history to form Yin-Yang Complement soul cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he sensed the crisis Tang Wutong was in, Huo Yuhao immediately reacted. His soul power that was entangled with her started to rapidly move. There was only one goal – slow down the circulation of Tang Wutong’s soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After she was unconscious for so many days, Tang Wutong’s soul power was in a resting phase. Due to this, her own functions were slightly slow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The volume of Huo Yuhao’s soul power was greater than hers. After absorbing so much soul power earlier, Tang Wutong’s soul core circulated at a slower speed as Huo Yuhao moved this time. It was even being delayed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A golden whirlpool was taking form in Tang Wutong’s spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She found it much easier to form her second soul core compared to Huo Yuhao. This spiritual soul core was already ready. She just had to absorb it. Her first soul core in her dantian was restrained by Huo Yuhao. In this way, Tang Wutong’s cultivation speed would become much faster than Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao managed to do this as he used the fact that Tang Wutong’s soul power didn’t reject him. Of course, the more important thing was that it came from the Clear Sky Sect’s secret method. Without this secret method, Tang Wutong wouldn’t have been able to absorb Huo Yuhao’s soul core no matter what. It was the kind of ability that didn’t exist in the world of soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a relieved look on Huo Yuhao’s face. He was already seeing the likelihood of success. Golden light was still shining brightly on Tang Wutong’s forehead. However, she was about to fully absorb his spiritual soul core.</span></p>
