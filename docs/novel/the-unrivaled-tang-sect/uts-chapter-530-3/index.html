 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, that was a hundred meter-tall bear. Its appearance had sent all the spectral creatures, including the fearsome skeleton dragon which was flying high up in the sky, scurrying away. It was almost as if it were the king of the world of the undead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And that was, in fact, the truth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gigantic bear only stopped after it reached the spot where the group was gathered. Now that it was nearer to them, the Elders could feel how strong its soul power was. In fact, it was radiating more than just soul power; it was also emanating a dense spectral aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Bai waved its hand as the gigantic bear lowered its body. Little Bai leapt onto the bear’s shoulder before the gigantic bear stood up again. Following which, it leaned its body forward as though it was bowing to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded to acknowledge the bow from the bear. Following which, he turned to the Elders and smiled. “This gigantic bear was Little Bai’s original physical form. Previously, Little Bai and I did our spirit fusion in the spectral demiplane. It was during that time when Little Bai’s body started to change for unknown reasons. It somehow managed to remain alive. As a result, I was not able to acquire his soul bone. But in return, this made it even stronger than before. Now, it is the strongest fighter in my spectral demiplane. It is the true king of this place and hence, I am certain that our soul masters will not come to any harm under its protection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had given Little Bai’s body the name Er Bai. Of course, it was named this way simply out of convenience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously when Er Bai was struck by the lightning, it managed to absorb the spectral aura in the spectral demiplane and form its own spiritual fire. Of course, its spiritual fire was formed from the remnants left by Little Bai when he transferred his spirit to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The main reason why Huo Yuhao did not take the soul bone from Little Bai’s body was because the soul bone had become a source of energy for Er Bai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After these two years, Er Bai had already gained a stronghold in the spectral plane. Just as Huo Yuhao had described, he had already become the king of the spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Er Bai and Little Bai were connected by heart, even if Huo Yuhao was not in the spectral demiplane, he could monitor Er Bai’s situation through Little Bai. Hence, it would not be a problem for him to take care of and protect the army which would be placed in the spectral demiplane in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song nodded and said, “Yuhao, your demiplane is truly amazing. After seeing how things work in your demiplane, I am willing to support your suggestion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Elder Song.” Huo Yuhao hastily thanked Elder Song.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subsequently, the rest of the Elders all nodded in agreement as they gave their consent to Huo Yuhao’s plan. To be honest, other than Huo Yuhao’s unorthodox method, none of them had any idea that could bring hope to the current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Shrek Academy was very strong, it would still be very difficult for them to resist the armies of the Sun Moon Empire if they were to launch an attack against them. Furthermore, it would be impossible for the Sun Moon Empire to let go of Shrek Academy, especially after what they had done previously to replace the Sun Moon Continent’s name with Douluo Continent. The hatred the Sun Moon Empire had for Shrek Academy had become one which concerned the pride of the Sun Moon Empire. Hence, Shrek Academy could only stand on the opposing side of the Sun Moon Empire. There was simply no other option.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During these few years, Shrek Academy had made tremendous advancements in terms of their development of soul tools. Hence, many of the higher-ups in Shrek Academy recognized the power and importance of soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek Academy might have improved their powers tremendously by researching and harnessing the power of soul tools during these few years, but one could only imagine how much stronger the Sun Moon Empire would be, considering how much longer they had dabbled in soul tools. Because the development of soul tool was exponential, their powers could only exceed Shrek Academy’s original calculations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, the academy definitely did not possess the confidence that it would win its battle with the Sun Moon Empire. An unorthodox strategy was required to be victorious. Hence, Huo Yuhao’s plan was the most convincing strategy in the eyes of the Elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, that was probably the only way they could turn the tables. While the Sun Moon Empire definitely had their weaknesses, it would not be easy to expose them on the actual battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving the spectral demiplane, the Sea God’s Pavilion Conference resumed. The atmosphere in the conference was visibly more optimistic. It was undeniable that the existence of the spectral demiplane had become Shrek Academy’s trump card to go up against the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amongst the powerful Elders, some of them were particularly skilled in the art of war. Those Elders started to offer suggestions to further improve Huo Yuhao’s plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took them an entire day before the conference ended. Shrek Academy made the final decision to mobilize the three Soul Engineer Legions and adhere to Huo Yuhao’s plan. The academy would not be sending any higher-ups to participate in this operation. Instead, they would be heading to the frontlines of the Heavenly Soul Empire to deceive the troops from the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This operation would mainly be organized by the Tang Sect. The powerful cultivators from the Tang Sect would leave their nest and take action against the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After their discussions, it was time for the preparatory work. They had also decided on the mobilization time—the time when the Sun Moon Empire planned to move out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three Soul Engineer Legions from Shrek Academy and the Tang Sect consisted of the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion, the Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion, and the Fort Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amongst the three legions, the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion had the fewest number of people. However, it was formed from their elite soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The commander of the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion was originally Xian Lin’er. Furthermore, there were about ten Titled Douluo in the entire Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion. However, Shrek Academy had decided after the Conference to not participate in this operation directly. Hence, the ten Titled Douluo would not remain within the legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This meant that the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion would now be led by new commanders. The new commander would be Bei Bei, while the vice-commander would be Xu Sanshi. Jiang Nannan and the other powerful cultivators of the Tang Sect were also moved into this legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their total number would be two hundred soul masters. Every single one of them was at least a Soul Emperor. It was difficult even for the Sun Moon Empire to organize a legion with members at this level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The commander of the Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion was Huo Yuhao, while its vice-commander was Tang Wutong. They were commanding a legion of a thousand soul masters—or rather soul engineers. They were equipped with three hundred top-class huge Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons. They were all Class 6 soul tools, and required their soul engineers to be at least Class 4 to utilize them. These cannons were all equipped with large amounts of stationary soul cannon shells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last legion was formed from 1500 soul masters with relatively weaker cultivations. Their minimum cultivation level was a three-ringed Soul Elder. Their commander was Caitou, while their vice-commander was Xiao Xiao. They were equipped with three hundred of Xuan Ziwen’s personally redesigned All-Terrain Self-Driving Forts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These three soul engineer legions were all built painstakingly by the Shrek Academy over two years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, these legions had already started to take shape a year ago. Since then, they had been training hard and receiving improved equipment. Right now, they had started to become a formidable force, and would be the main fighting force for Huo Yuhao’s plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it came to surprise attacks, the quality of the soldiers was more important than quantity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the military drill ground near the perimeter of Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The military drill ground seemed to have been transformed into a metallic forest as it emanated a scary aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were close to three thousand soul masters, three hundred Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons, and three hundred All-Terrain Self-Driving Forts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single soul master in the three legions was overwhelmed with excitement. They were finally going to enter the battlefield after having trained for two long years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had trained hard every single day as they tried their best to master their soul tools. In fact, many of them had once participated in the battle against the Great Star Dou Forest during the beast wave to protect Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were the true elite forces of Shrek City. The truth was that these three legions had pretty much expended half of Shrek City’s financial resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, they were finally going to leave Shrek City to fight their formidable foe. Everyone wished they could become famous in this battle. Everyone wished to leave their beautiful name in the history books.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no doubt that the war against the Sun Moon Empire was going to be a big opportunity for many people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the higher-ups of the Tang Sect, including Bei Bei, He Caitou, Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan, Xiao Xiao, Huo Yuhao, Tang Wutong, Ye Guyi, Nan Qiuqiu, Ji Juechen, and Jing Ziyan, were all dressed in their military gear as they observed their soldiers from the observation deck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen had gotten Na Na and Gao Dalou to stay at the Tang Sect with him to ensure the continuation of daily operations. Other than them, pretty much all of the higher-ups in Tang Sect had been mobilized.</span></p>

I believe everyone already knows what kind of operation we are about to commence against the Sun Moon Empire. I only have one request for all of you. I need all of you to listen to the orders being issued. Regardless of what you see and discover after this, you must adhere to the orders which have been given to you. If we are able to emerge victorious and succeed, our names will all be engraved in the glorious history of the Douluo Continent.”</span></p>

At the same time, it is about defending our country and our homeland. I believe many of you here come from the Heavenly Soul Empire. You should all be familiar with its current situation. We can’t watch our country be ravaged in this war without doing anything. We must put in effort to defend our country.”</span></p>

His powerful spiritual energy was able to envelop the entire military drill ground.</span></p>
