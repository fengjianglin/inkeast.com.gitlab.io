He nodded at her with a faint smile on his face when she didn’t answer him, and then turned around and walked towards the canteen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong shook her fist furiously as she watched Huo Yuhao’s figure gradually disappear. She really wanted to beat this detestable guy up, even though she didn’t know why this guy was so detestable…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I also want to eat!” Tang Wutong stomped her foot, and raised her little arrogant chin pridefully as she stepped towards the canteen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After breakfast, everything around Huo Yuhao seemed to become air. He directly returned to his tent, and didn’t reappear until evening. He didn’t even come out for lunch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Others naturally wouldn’t go disturb him. Soul masters sometimes skipped meals when they were having closed-door cultivation. That was very normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao only reappeared once the sky had gone completely dark. This time, he went right into the commander’s tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Duke, sir.” Huo Yuhao greeted respectfully as he came before the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard you didn’t eat lunch, Yuhao. Were you cultivating?” The White Tiger Duke asked with a faint smile on his face. He had a very good impression of Huo Yuhao – this youth wasn’t even twenty, but he had a very calm and stable personality. More importantly, he had that Spiritual Detection, and he could be said to be a fantastic boost for the Star Luo Empire’s reconnaissance efforts and capability. Even though they were mired in a terrible situation at the moment, they were at least able to find some chances to resist their enemies on the level of soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Sir, I have to go out tonight. I’m here to report my intentions to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” The smile on the White Tiger Duke’s face immediately froze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re going back out tonight? No.” Dai Hao almost immediately denied Huo Yuhao’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of joke is that? Last night’s expedition was already so dangerous, and he almost didn’t come back. What are we to do if the Death God is activated when he heads back out tonight?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without considering how he felt about him, and just considering his reconnaissance value and his importance to the entire Star Luo Empire, his death in action would be an enormous and irreparable loss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Rest assured, Duke. I will not risk my life to investigate the Death God. I have to think about this a little more because I haven’t done sufficient preparation. However, I can’t do nothing right now – otherwise, we’re as good as trapped right here, and the Sun Moon Empire would have achieved their goal in this aspect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then what are you going to do?” The White Tiger Duke’s expression relaxed a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao squinted a little and said, “The Sun Moon Empire have locked down our surveillance capabilities for such a long time. I don’t have a solution for the main peak where the Death God is located, but can I not do something about those surveillance soul tools? I’m going to cause some trouble for them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke’s eyes glowed. “Are you saying…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stepped in front of the White Tiger Duke and whispered some things to him. The White Tiger Duke’s eyes became increasingly bright as he listened, and he nodded continuously towards the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, do that. Don’t worry, everything that you achieve or obtain will belong to you. Of course, if you’re willing, the empire is willing to pay and purchase them from you as well. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Deal.” Huo Yuhao answered without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke asked, “Do you need me to help with anything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “No need. I’ll be the smallest target by myself, so my buddies from the Tang Sect will be enough to give me support. One reason why I came to tell you is so that you will know, and another reason is so that I can tell you to pay attention to your defenses and to safeguard against any operations that our enemies make take in revenge.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sneer appeared at the corner of the White Tiger Duke’s mouth. “Revenge? I was afraid that they wouldn’t come. I earnestly wish that they send their entire army to take their revenge.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Star Luo Empire had an absolute advantage in terms of open battle. They had eight soul master legions’ worth of fighting strength, and without considering soul tools, the White Tiger Duke was confident of completely defeating the soul engineers in the Sun Moon Empire’s Hand that Protects the Nation if they were fighting one-on-one. Of course, the premise was that the soul engineers appeared as soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao immediately gathered his companions once he exited the commander’s tent and told them about his plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one was overly worried about his plans. With Huo Yuhao’s abilities, he wouldn’t be in too much danger as long as he didn’t investigate the main peak. In the end, his abilities to confuse his enemies were too strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One hour later, the camp that belonged to the Star Luo Empire’s Northwestern Field Army was completely pitch-black. There was light shining from the surveillance towers, but besides that, the soldiers were all resting. Such was life in the military – everyone slept early and woke up early. They did this to avoid ambushes from their enemies at midnight, and so that the army could keep themselves in top fighting condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A black shadow rose soundlessly through the air and high into the sky in the darkness of the night. All of the Northwestern Field Army’s aerial surveillance soul tools were entirely shut down at this moment, and this shadow didn’t trigger any reaction at all as it rose into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shadow after shadow rose into the sky immediately afterwards, and they followed that first figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was flying at an altitude of about one thousand meters. His flying-type soul tool was activated, and he was using Imitation at the same time. It was easiest for him to control his flight at such a height, and his speed was incredible. Typical surveillance soul tools in the air couldn’t even detect his existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ming Dou Mountain Range was but several dozen kilometers from the Northwestern Field Army’s camp. Soul sages required very little time to fly across such a short distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark towering mountain swiftly appeared within Huo Yuhao’s vision. At this moment, he was completely within the range of the Sun Moon Empire’s aerial surveillance soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stabilized himself in midair and looked up at the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He ran the risk of being detected if he continued forward. The oscillation detectors were the most troublesome for him – those soul tools released countless soundwaves, and their method of detection imitated that of bats. Any kind of soul skills meant for concealment wouldn’t avoid detection. Oscillation detectors were undoubtedly the mainstream for future development in surveillance soul tools. At this point, their detection range was just relatively shorter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao released his spiritual power and stretched it far into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes quickly revealed surprise –&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">damn! How many surveillance soul tools are there?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far in the distance, there were thousands of surveillance soul tools of many different kinds dotting the sky. There were surveillance soul tools of almost every type, and they were arranged neatly in midair as they stretched out to both sides of the mountain range. They stretched beyond the horizon with no end in sight, and just looking at them in front of him made him feel like there were thousands of them – it was hard to say how many more there were further out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s nice – the Sun Moon Empire is very wealthy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A faint smile appeared on Huo Yuhao’s face as his flying-type soul tool slowly became vertical. The blast ports pointed downwards, and he released his own soul power at the same time. His entire body surged into the sky, and he flew towards a higher altitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The aerial surveillance soul tools in front of him weren’t his targets. There were large amounts of ground-to-air and air-to-ground offensive soul tools behind those surveillance soul tools cooperating with them. That was position after position of soul tools. Individually, their offensive capabilities paled in comparison with that of the Death God, but if all their offensive capabilities fired off at the same time, they would be able to cover an incredibly massive area. Escaping from them wouldn’t be that easy – otherwise, what did they rely on to stop the Star Luo Empire’s great army?</span></p>

Huo Yuhao took about fifteen minutes to fly from one thousand meters all the way to around three thousand meters in the air.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao immediately activated Imitation to the highest possible level, and he channeled his soul power and suddenly picked up speed as he flew towards the large item that was over two meters long.</span></p>

However, high altitude aerial surveillance soul tools had to resist the bitter cold, and there were multiple other requirements that they had to deal with to remain at such an altitude, so they seemed a lot more unwieldy and heavy. Huo Yuhao had captured one before, so he understood their structure very well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">High altitude aerial surveillance soul tools relied more on visual detection. Oscillation capabilities hadn’t been developed yet, and thermal detection wasn’t very useful, so they weren’t installed. Huo Yuhao relied on his Imitation, and in addition to his aura of Ultimate Ice concealing him, it was impossible for him to be discovered as he moved closer.</span></p>

He wasn’t hasty about it, and he activated Spiritual Detection and surveyed his surroundings.</span></p>

He suddenly descended a little, and placed a metal piece that was about the size of a palm against the top of that high altitude aerial surveillance soul tool. This metal piece didn’t have a large surface area, and it was stuck against the soul tool’s blind spot, so Huo Yuhao wasn’t afraid of it being discovered at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He flew back up again afterwards and went towards his next target.</span></p>

These six Milk Bottles could double the amount of time that Huo Yuhao could continue flying at a height of three thousand meters. But even then, he had to continuously consume his own soul power at the same time, and he also had to fight against the thin air and the bitter cold, so his soul power and physical strength were still being continuously expended.</span></p>

He turned around and flew back in the direction he had come from.</span></p>
