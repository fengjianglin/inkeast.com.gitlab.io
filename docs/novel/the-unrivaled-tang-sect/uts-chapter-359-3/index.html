This should be a Class 8 stationary soul cannon!</span></p>

He also felt very weird when he shouted these two words.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Why am I concerned about his safety?</span></p>

A huge, deafening explosion shook the region covered by the earthen light. Debris scattered all around, and the intense shockwaves instantly engulfed more than a thousand square meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Defend!” The White Tiger Duke shouted. He didn’t retreat. His first, third, and fifth soul rings flashed. His figure instantly doubled in size. As he smacked his tiger palms together, a layer of intense white light started to spread out, with his body at the center. The shockwaves that were coming towards him were blocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw this scene, Huo Yuhao, who subconsciously moved to shield Wang Dong’er, was a little dazed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Given the White Tiger Duke’s abilities, he would not be dealt much harm if he only protected himself. However, the barrier he erected covered an extremely wide area. He was bound to be drained at a much faster rate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Explosions rang continuously. The ground started to fissure, starting from the center point of the explosion. These fissures quickly extended in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One side of the path that they were on was a cliff, while the other side was a tall mountain. Although the mountain pass was considered quite wide, there were many rocks falling from the sky after the explosion occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Landslide!</span></p>

Even though their individual strengths were insignificant in the face of such a terrifying explosion, they tried to gather together at this point. A portion of them with shields lifted them up to block the falling rocks and incoming shockwaves. The four special guards rushed forward without any hesitation and helped the White Tiger Duke with some of the pressure he was facing. However, the incoming shockwaves were still too strong, so strong that they were driven back as they were struck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao already roughly knew what the soul tool was. It was a Class 8 stationary soul cannon shell called a Landslide Shell!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When soul tools were at least Class 7, those with special effects would be given their own names. This was especially true for stationary soul cannon shells. There were all types of names for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Landslide Shell was one of them. It was supposed to be a Class 7 stationary soul cannon shell. However, it was classified as a Class 8 shell after special formation arrays and materials were used to strengthen its cloaking and obstructive capabilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had very strong penetrating abilities. It would immediately drill into the ground once it landed, tapping into its rare metal formation that had a great affinity for earthen elements. It could drill into soil or granite in the shortest possible time before unleashing an immense shockwave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The shock that it unleashed was equivalent to a hundred shock cannon shells, simulating the strength of an explosion and enabling it to cause a landslide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Landslide Shell wasn’t considered very lethal among the Class 8 stationary soul cannon shells. However, it was more stable, which allowed it to be hidden effectively. Its effect on a battlefield could be quite great, especially in strategic attacks like this. The enemies’ goal was very simple… block off the White Tiger Duke’s return route and buy time for them to assassinate him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“General, quickly leave! Don’t care about us!” the special guard who was a Soul Sage shouted anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, the strongest shockwave had already passed. However, the White Tiger Duke didn’t leave. With his cultivation, flying at a low altitude was nothing. However, he turned back and kept on unleashing his White Tiger Meteor Shower in the air. He crushed the falling rocks that were going to hit his men</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Huo Yuhao looked at him drifting in mid-air, he felt as if something were choking him in his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He is actually risking being assassinated in order to protect his subordinates. He…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao shouted, “Cut the crap! Soldiers, get ready to fight the enemy! All of you are my warriors and my fellow soldiers. I won’t leave any one of you behind! We’ll remain here and wait for reinforcements!” As he spoke, he lifted his hand, and a beam of bright light shot into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They weren’t very far from the base. They wouldn’t need to wait too long for reinforcements to arrive. After the aerial attacks and the explosion that had just occurred, their camp should have been put on alert, and reinforcements should be on the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge hole a few hundred meters wide had been blown apart in front of them. It was impossible for them to traverse it on foot. If the White Tiger Duke left on his own, he would be forsaking his White Tiger bodyguards, who consisted of more than a hundred men. In a war, such a situation was very common. However, the White Tiger Duke didn’t make that decision. He was their general, and the soul of the Star Luo Empire’s military. He was a true hero. There was no way he could forsake his soldiers and brothers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, it might not be a wrong choice to defend here. After all, it was very difficult to tell where the enemy would come from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Dai Huabin saw that his father was unwilling to leave, he started to turn anxious. He hurriedly asked Huo Yuhao, “What do we do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao clenched his fist tightly. “What else can we do? Let’s help him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t decide for the White Tiger Duke. The only thing they could do now was help him guard this place. In addition, they weren’t too far from their base. They still had a chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao activated his Spiritual Detection and covered the area where the White Tiger bodyguards were. Huo Yuhao couldn’t share his spiritual power with everyone, but he shared it with the White Tiger Duke and the four special guards from earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Huo Yuhao’s help, the White Tiger Duke was able to more efficiently intercept the falling rocks with his White Tiger Meteor Shower. All the large rocks were destroyed by his Meteor Shower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er had also opened up her Radiant Butterfly Goddess’ wings at this moment. With Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection, she unleashed her Light of the Butterfly Goddess to help the White Tiger Duke. She further lowered the threat of the landslide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bodyguards weren’t idle, either. Although not all of them had shields, they still used their weapons to sweep the falling rocks away from them. While there were still some casualties, there weren’t too many.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, streaks of red light suddenly flashed from afar. They appeared in a very elaborate pattern, and started to move towards the White Tiger Duke and his guards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were explosive bombs!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao focused his gaze, then sighed in his heart. He could guess the origin of his enemies. First, there was a Class 8 stationary soul cannon shell, then there were explosive cluster bombs. It had to be the Sun Moon Empire!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 30pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke took a deep breath before he turned in the air. He flew towards the bombs as his fourth soul ring continued to shine. His White Tiger Meteor Shower changed directions just like a rapidfire cannon, flying straight towards the explosive bombs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, he also shouted, “White Tiger bodyguards, listen to my orders. Disperse and retreat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was very difficult for them to disperse in such an area. The path in front had been blown apart, making it extremely uneven. On one side, there was a cliff. On the other side, there was a mountain. They could only search for a route through the area that had been blown apart. Fortunately, there was a gentle slope that they could use to leave this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These soldiers would never defy the White Tiger Duke’s orders. After hearing his order, the captain leading the troops immediately led them towards the pathway that had been blown apart.</span></p>

When they came to the edge of the cliff, they only saw a deep depression.</span></p>

As he saw the disconnected path in front of him, he seemed desolated. He quickly turned around and faced the rest of the bodyguards that had followed him, revealing a determined look on his face.</span></p>

The Duke remained because of us. If not for us, he would already be safe. We are at an impasse right now. Every second that we burden the Duke puts him in one more second of danger. Ever since we joined the White Tiger bodyguards, we knew that we were willing to sacrifice our lives for the Duke. I won’t force any of you to do so now. Those who are willing to follow me, you’ll always be my good brothers. Sir, I’m willing to sacrifice my life for you. Please take care.”</span></p>

Because of them, their enemies were inching closer and closer. No one knew when reinforcements would arrive. The only way to ensure the White Tiger Duke’s safety was to allow him to retreat quickly, and the reinforcements to gather. However, the White Tiger Duke was unwilling to forsake them, which made them his burden. There wasn’t any way they could disperse here. The only thing they could do was sacrifice their lives to save the White Tiger Duke!</span></p>

The White Tiger Duke’s subordinates were willing to sacrifice their lives for him, and he was willing to risk his life to protect them, too! Suddenly, he seemed to become mightier in Huo Yuhao’s mind. As he pulled at Wang Dong’er, the two of them leapt off the cliff.</span></p>
