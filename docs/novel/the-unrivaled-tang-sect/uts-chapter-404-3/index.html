 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao suddenly shouted at this moment, “No one comes over!” A terrifying spiritual intent was suddenly unleashed from his body, and everyone felt their spirits shaking. Even though their cultivations were more powerful than his, they still couldn’t help but stop in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian’s attack was extremely quick. In an instant, his purplish-gold dragon claw had already landed on Huo Yuhao; he had captured Huo Yuhao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao didn’t resist at all. There was a calm look on his face, as if he wasn’t bothered about this number one Savage Beast that was in front of him. He lifted his head and pushed his chest out. There was only a relieved and arrogant look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Di Tian’s purplish-gold dragon claws landed on Huo Yuhao’s body, a terrifying force was transmitted into his body, and the rose-gold flames were extinguished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Di Tian’s strength. Even the Emperor Beast Wang Qiu’er couldn’t do anything when Huo Yuhao ignited his spiritual sea. However, Di Tian managed to stop it easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, Huo Yuhao had ignited his own spiritual sea when he tried to break free from Xian Lin’er and Yan Shaozhe earlier. Otherwise, there was no way he could have scared off so many Titled Douluo with his Spiritual Blast no matter how strong his spiritual power was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, his spiritual sea that was burning had been extinguished. As Di Tian retracted his claws, Huo Yuhao was also brought in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t even half as tall as Di Tian’s golden eyes. He looked extremely small in front of Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard! You were the one who seduced the Emperor Beast and made her sacrifice herself as a Sacrifice for you. Do you not believe that I have countless ways to torture you and make your life worse than death?” The terrifying pressure that came from him caused the space around Huo Yuhao to start cracking. The immense suction force that came from Di Tian even threatened to pull Huo Yuhao’s spirit out. He started feeling intense pain throughout his entire body and spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao had been through a lot of pain before. The pain that Di Tian inflicted on him couldn’t compare to the excruciating pain he had suffered when he fused with the Ice Empress. It also couldn’t compare to the pain he had suffered when he consumed the water from the Blazing Sunspring for Wang Dong’er. As for the pain that he felt in his spirit, how could it compare to the pain of watching Wang Dong’er enter a deep sleep, and seeing Wang Qiu’er sacrifice herself for him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was very calm. The intense pain he felt caused beads of perspiration to stream down his forehead. However, his face was still filled with arrogance as Di Tian grabbed hold of him. He didn’t cry out in pain, and he wasn’t going to beg for mercy. He just stared at Di Tian calmly. It was like the death that could come at any time meant nothing to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Huo Yuhao willingly land in the hands of Di Tian, Elder Xuan was extremely infuriated, and shouted furiously into the sky, “Di Tian, I swear on my status as the Hallmaster of the Sea God’s Pavilion that I’ll completely wipe out all the soul beasts in the Great Star Dou Forest if you dare to harm him!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, the beast wave might have come because of Huo Yuhao. However, how much had Huo Yuhao contributed to the Academy during these years?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had created Spirits, which had never existed before, and played a huge role in helping Shrek Academy’s Soul Tool Department thrive. He, Bei Bei, and the rest had established the Tang Sect, and helped the Academy achieve the highest glory in the previous two Continental Elite Advanced Soul Master Academy Tournaments. He was also an heir to the Sea God’s Pavilion, chosen personally by Elder Mu. He had an Ultimate martial soul, and was the pride of Shrek Academy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had even led the Tang Sect to save almost all the hostages that had been imprisoned by the Sun Moon Empire. It was an accident that the Emperor Beast had sacrificed herself for him. This calamity that descended upon Shrek was just fate! Just as this calamity was about to be fully unleashed onto Shrek, he appeared once again, and was willing to sacrifice himself to overcome this calamity. How could Elder Xuan watch him die without doing anything?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian coldly replied, “I never intended to let Shrek off! I’ll kill all of you! I’d really like to see how you plan to turn the entire Great Star Dou Forest into corpses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can do it!” Huo Yuhao suddenly said coldly. Even under Di Tian’s pressure, he still tolerated the agonizing pain, and this spiritual intent was still accurately passed into Di Tian’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have the legacy of the Emperor Beast’s Sacrifice. I now control the power of destiny that she once controlled. Perhaps I’m unable to defeat you or decide your fate. However, I can at least decide my own fate. I can end my own destiny with a thought, and die just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When that happens, I’ll end the destiny of the Great Star Dou Forest too. Beast God, do you believe in destiny?” Huo Yuhao uttered that last sentence word by word. Every word that he said was filled with immense spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you threatening me!?” Di Tian roared furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao calmly replied, “You can say so. If Shrek is destroyed, the Great Star Dou Forest will follow it! As the Beast God, aren’t you going to think about your subjects?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian furiously said, “Shrek City has harmed my subjects for years! This blood feud can only be washed clean with human blood!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao snapped, “All of you deserved it. If you hadn’t lead the soul beast army to attack us, you wouldn’t have suffered such heavy losses. However, you still have half of your subjects. The Great Star Dou Forest can still maintain its ecological balance. Let’s first ignore the fact that my death will end the destiny of the Great Star Dou Forest. Ask yourself, how many of the soul beasts outside the city right now will be able to survive after you destroy Shrek? Will the three empires in the Douluo Continent let all of you off? To them, the Great Star Dou Forest is a huge treasure vault. Even after you destroy Shrek, the forest will still have suffered great losses. The three empires will find it a fantastic opportunity to move on the forest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Great Star Dou Forest is doomed if Shrek is destroyed! You’ll still have hope if you retreat now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian suddenly calmed down, and his golden eyes also deepened. He stopped roaring, and interacted with Huo Yuhao using his spiritual intent too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, you are right. Shrek’s destruction might catalyze the Great Star Dou Forest’s annihilation. However, are you sure humans won’t destroy us, even if we retreat now? You are wrong! They’ll still continue to target us! Humans are greedy! When there were only soul masters, a large number of soul rings were already required! Now that there are soul engineers, some of the ordinary soul masters that originally weren’t supposed to advance to higher tiers can also improve through some special methods! Even if the quality of the soul rings that they require are lower, they still have to kill soul beasts to obtain those soul rings!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now that the Great Star Dou Forest has suffered greatly, we’ll be unable to protect ourselves in the future. As your soul tools become stronger, will there be room for the survival of soul beasts? While the Emperor Beast’s Sacrifice is one of the reasons we started this beast wave, it’s not the only reason! More importantly, we’ve found it necessary to stop your evolution before we become your slaves and are destroyed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was shocked by Di Tian’s sudden composure. He no longer sounded as crazy as he was earlier… or perhaps he had actually never gone berserk at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Beast God, I have a question for you.” Huo Yuhao tried his best to keep calm. He was clear that Di Tian would be able to clearly sense any spiritual undulations from him no matter how slight they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ask me,” Di Tian replied. However, Huo Yuhao could see a trace of loneliness in his huge golden eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao asked, “You’re the king of all beasts, the protector of all soul beasts and the number one Savage Beast, as appraised by humans. However, you’ve got to admit that humans are much more intelligent than soul beasts. Am I right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian replied, “Yes, you are right. Otherwise, humans wouldn’t have been able to evolve from their position as prey to what they are today in a short few tens of thousands of years. Even though I’m not willing to admit it, humans are indeed the rulers of the entire continent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Do you really think that humans didn’t realize the imbalance that was arising between humans and soul beasts as soul engineers became popular and the number of both soul masters and soul engineers increased? Perhaps most soul masters and soul engineers ignore this because of their own interests, but there are bound to be some with great foresight that have recognized this problem, right? After all, what good does it do for humans if soul beasts are destroyed? We’ll lose our source of soul rings. If there aren’t any soul masters in the future, this profession will forever be lost to history, right? That will be extremely harmful towards the development of both soul masters and soul engineers.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After remaining silent for a brief moment, Di Tian said, “So what? Are humans able to stop the greed of soul masters and soul engineers? And stop hunting and killing soul beasts?”</span></p>
