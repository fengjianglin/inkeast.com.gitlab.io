 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had indeed slowed down. He retracted his other four fingers before using his left hand to pick up the rare metal. Only his right index finger continued to make minor carvings on the metal. Even though he was still quick, he was now much slower than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Metal scraps continued to fall, and Huo Yuhao stayed extremely focused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though it was only the first out of twenty-four core formations, it was still much more complex than the central core formations of many Class 7 soul tools. The more advanced the soul tool, the more difficult it was to make. It was just like soul masters and soul engineers: the higher the cultivation, the more difficult it was to achieve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen felt a sense of nostalgia as he watched Huo Yuhao. Long ago, when he was still in the Sun Moon Empire, he had relied on making a Class 8 decomposition cannon to become the youngest Class 8 soul engineer in the Illustrious Virtue Hall. At the same time, he became their chief researcher!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was really high-spirited back then. It was a pity that his power was so restricted in the Illustrious Virtue Hall. Eventually, he was poached by Huo Yuhao, and came to the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xuan Ziwen didn’t regret his choice at all. Ever since he had come to the Tang Sect, he had been shown respect. At the same time, the Tang Sect and Shrek Academy didn’t skimp on providing him with all types of resources. Otherwise, how could he have become a Class 9 soul engineer in such a short period of time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Xuan Ziwen knew that he wasn’t inferior to anyone else in terms of soul tool research, he was also very aware that his foundation in terms of his soul power cultivation was very poor. Initially, he had relied on all sorts of medicine to become a Soul Douluo. Before he reached Class 9, he believed that anyone with seven rings in the Tang Sect could easily defeat him if he didn’t use a soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally, he was very busy with work, and didn’t even have time to think about daily matters. Now that he finally had the time to rest, all types of thoughts ran through his mind. However, he was still very fixated on Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was going faster and faster. From his initial unfamiliarity, he slowly regained the feeling of making a soul tool. Even he himself was delighted and surprised by that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This rare metal seemed to have been enlarged in his eyes. Even some very minor details were attended to under his meticulous observation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the start, he didn’t dare to use any carving techniques. However, as time passed, he found things much easier using his spiritual power as a guide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, his first core formation had been completed. He carefully placed it on a corner of the carving table. He then picked up his second piece of rare metal and started to carve it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen took a few steps forward and silently picked up that first core formation, carefully examining it. After a brief moment, he nodded and put it back in its original position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kid has indeed not been slacking.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the appraisal that Xuan Ziwen gave after seeing the core formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the fact that Huo Yuhao could create a core formation in such a short period of time, it was evident that he was a qualified Class 7 soul engineer. He was even one of the more experienced ones.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps I should let him try one of the simpler Class 8 soul tools. He might successfully create them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, this was only an instantaneous thought passing through Xuan Ziwen’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was already getting faster and faster. The creation of the second core formation took only four-fifths of the time he needed to make the first one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All twenty-four core formations were being built for the same goal. There were three groups of eight, and each group had their own similarities. Furthermore, they were also interlinked in some aspects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took two hours to finish the first group of core formations. The eight formations were neatly arranged on the table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen revealed a weird expression on his face when he saw this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could still clearly remember that he had taken a total of six days to finish creating a Class 8 decomposition cannon when he was still a Class 8 soul engineer. As for the first group of core formations, it had taken him three days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were the same core formations. The first group was the most difficult. It was only at the later stages that one could proceed faster as they grasped the technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kid has actually succeeded? At least it doesn’t seem like he’s made a mistake. It’ll be even easier later on. Surely he hasn’t made a mistake, has he?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen wanted to remind Huo Yuhao that he could take a break halfway into making an advanced soul tool to recharge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when he looked at Huo Yuhao, he immediately discovered that Huo Yuhao was very energetic. He didn’t seem the least bit tired at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He doesn’t need to rest, then,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen thought to himself wickedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned around and walked out. He found that it was already dark outside. From the sky, it looked like it was six hours to daybreak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hmph, if he can’t finish before daybreak, it won’t count even if he succeeds in the end. Furthermore, so what if he succeeds? If it can’t be used, he’ll still lose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Xuan Ziwen didn’t realize that his mentality had already changed. At the start, he had believed that Huo Yuhao was destined to fail. Right now, he was already starting to think of ways to keep Huo Yuhao behind. The change was quite gradual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-----</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao naturally didn’t know what Xuan Ziwen was thinking. He was completely invested right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was indeed much easier to complete the second group compared to the first group. However, he wasn’t complacent at all. He knew that any flaws could result in total failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a Class 8 soul tool. He needed to pour in soul power to link the components. If there were problems with the internal structure of the core formations, the entire formation would be disabled. When that happened, his efforts would be futile, and he would have wasted precious rare metals too. That was something he didn’t want to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One by one…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Huo Yuhao did his work, he was also counting. As time passed, he felt that his movements were getting more and more fluid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’ve seemed to become better after not practicing! Hehe, Teacher Xuan should be rather astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this thought only flashed across his mind before disappearing. He almost made a mistake from being just that slightly distracted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, his improvement from a lack of practice was an anomaly. As for the reason, it was because his cultivation had risen too quickly. Using his immense spiritual power as support and his originally sturdy foundation, he managed to remain error-free after immersing himself in the research of soul tools over the past few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how complex the core formations of a Class 8 soul tool were, they were still core formations. What was needed was only more effort, soul power, and experience!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao definitely sorely lacked experience. However, he had an advantage in the other aspects. The soul power of a soul master with twin martial souls was greater than most other soul masters of the same tier. Right now, Huo Yuhao’s soul power had only reached Rank 80, but he had the soul power of an ordinary Rank 85 Soul Douluo. This also meant that his actual cultivation wasn’t too far from a Titled Douluo. After all, he already had a soul core!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second group was completed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao let out a long breath. After he finished his second group of core formations, he finally lifted his head and stretched his neck to relax.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What time is it, eldest senior?” Huo Yuhao asked Bei Bei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei replied, “It’s only four more hours to daybreak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao responded before he got to work once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rest had already left to sleep. Only Bei Bei, Ji Juechen, Xuan Ziwen, and He Caitou remained in the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was normal for He Caitou and Xuan Ziwen to remain behind. However, Ji Juechen caught everyone by surprise by staying as well. He didn’t say anything, and only stood where he was, like a target board, silently observing Huo Yuhao. There were undulations in his eyes, as if he were thinking of something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others didn’t disturb him. This Sword Fanatic had a different mindset from ordinary people. However, his cultivation speed didn’t lag behind those from Shrek’s Seven Monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he was sparring less and less with the others. However, there was an obvious improvement every time he did so. In addition, he had identified one opponent, and kept going to that opponent. This relieved the pressure on many others. This person that he had identified was Xu Sanshi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since Xu Sanshi gained the Xuanwu Shield and fused with the Golden Tortoise, his abilities were on the rise. He had even beaten Ji Juechen. In addition, his defense was so strong that he was unafraid of Ji Juechen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Tang Sect, Ji Juechen was known for having the strongest offense, while Xu Sanshi had the strongest defense. It was only right for the two of them to spar. Xu Sanshi generally avoided Ji Juechen, as he didn’t want to keep fighting him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao only took one hour to finish the second group of core formations. However, he slowed down on the third group. The third group of core formations was the most complex, and the requirements for precision were also much greater. There was one formation that was in the center of the entire formation. This formation was the smallest, but the most complex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only the size of a cherry, but the patterns that had to be carved on it were very complex. There were easily two or three times more patterns in this one than there were in the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao first completed the seven other formations in the third group before he started on this most complex formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very careful, and slowed himself down. The golden lights in his eyes were much brighter than before. He was afraid of making even the slightest error.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen silently watched at one side. He had a look of admiration by now. He didn’t know what to say about this student in front of him.</span></p>
