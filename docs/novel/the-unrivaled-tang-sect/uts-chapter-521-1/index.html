 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When you want to form your second soul core, you’ll inevitably infringe upon your first soul core. Instead of there being one center, there’ll be two centers. Your first soul core will generate intense resistance. This is because you are disrupting the circulation of your first soul core by forming your second soul core. That’s why it becomes particularly difficult, and you’ll face a lot of interference.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded. Elder Xuan’s description fit the situation he was facing right now exactly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan continued, “It seems like you understand what I’m saying! Don’t tell me that you’ve already begun trying to form your second soul core?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly and replied, “I’ve been on it for some time, but I’ve not managed to make much progress. Otherwise, why would Wutong a Titled Douluo, but not me? We’ve been cultivating together, and the standard of our soul power roughly the same. This second soul core has been troubling me for a long time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he looked at Tang Wutong before looking at Huo Yuhao, Elder Xuan couldn’t help but sigh. “Impressive! Yuhao, you must remember never to rush trying to form your second soul core. If you are overly zealous, you might run amok. When that happens, even an immortal can’t save you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao was petrified. When Elder Xuan mentioned the words ‘run amok’, there was an obvious terrified look in his eyes. If even someone like him could become terrified, it showed how frightening running amok was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan laughed bitterly. “It almost happened to me once. I was much younger then, and therefore much more impulsive. If not for the fact that Elder Mu was by my side and helped me with the trouble, you guys wouldn’t be able to see me. Even so, I lay in bed for a good three years before I recovered my vital energy. For the next ten years, I didn’t dare to try forming my second soul core.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stunned. “So frightening?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan nodded seriously and said, “Yes, it’s very terrifying. Don’t forget that the successful formation of your first soul core means that your soul core is basically a soul power grenade that has been greatly compressed. When it’s stable, it is a source of soul power. But if it isn’t stable, its explosiveness is demonstrated. Once it blows apart, not even a streak of your spirit will be left behind. Don’t you think it’s terrifying? When I almost ran amok, there was a slight crack on the surface of my soul core before Elder Mu forcefully covered it. That’s why the worst didn’t happen. Otherwise, I would have been finished.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, since you are already at this stage, you should be able to sense it deeply. I’ll continue talking and you’ll continue to listen to me intently. It’ll be useful for your future breakthrough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan continued, saying, “There are two known methods of forming your second soul core. Most soul masters choose the first method, Resonance, which I mentioned earlier. To prevent your second soul core from disrupting your first soul core, you must first listen to your first soul core and respect its existence. During the formation of your second soul core, you must first find the rhythm and frequency of the circulation of your first soul core. When you attempt to form your second soul core, you must first resonate with your first soul core. This will minimize any disruption. Your second soul core must circulate and compress to the standard of your first soul core, before picking up speed and creating two centers instead of one. What’s needed is soul power compression and revolution. However, the new core will be along the straight line of the diameter of the two circles combined. Since it’s bigger, it can consolidate and compress more soul power. This is the reason why Ultimate Douluo are so strong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So that’s why!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If not for Elder Xuan’s explanation, Huo Yuhao would have taken another ten years to understand this concept. He might not have even learned the technique, and faced the possibility of running amok.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan said, “Although it’s difficult to form your second soul core through resonance, you can succeed if you keep trying and your soul power and control are strong enough. Just like Elder Mu, the Darkness Holy Dragon, the Death God Douluo and myself, you should be walking this path.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was curious as he asked, “Elder Xuan, how de you know that Ye Xishui and Long Xiaoyao also took this path?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan smiled and said, “If they didn’t, the result would be completely different.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you talking about the second method?” Huo Yuhao asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan nodded and said, “Yes. Using resonance to form your second soul core is comparatively safer. This is because your first soul core is still the main one. The formation of your second soul core will follow the frequency of revolution of your first soul core, and thus not many problems will occur between your first and second soul cores. However, if you use another method to form your second soul core, the danger is much greater. Of course, the benefit is as great as the danger. The other method is ‘Yin Yang Complement’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yin Yang Complement?” Just like Resonance, this was Huo Yuhao’s first time coming across such a cultivation term.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan nodded. “It’s Yin Yang Complement. What this means is that the second soul core will follow a different path from the first soul core during its formation. It’ll be like forming a new soul core from scratch. The second soul core will have nothing to do with the first soul core. It’ll also be fully disrupted by the first soul core. If your soul power revolves towards the left when you first form your first soul core, then your second soul core has to revolve towards the right. Everything must be completely different from the first soul core.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was astonished. “How is that possible? Didn’t you say that the first soul core becomes the center of all my soul power after it forms? If my second soul core revolves in the opposite direction from my first soul core, wouldn’t it become a target, and cause me to run amok?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan shook his head and said, “No, you’re right. Your second soul core must revolve in the opposite direction as your first soul core within the sphere of influence of your first soul core. While the resistance is very great, you can achieve independence of your second soul core as long as it can complete a revolution. Let me now tell you how you can easily run amok given certain conditions. It happens the most easily when there’s chaos during the process of forming your soul core, rather than when your soul core revolves. You’ll face a major problem when any sort of chaos leads to disruption in the entire process. As a result, you should only use the Yin Yang Complement if you are strong enough and persistent enough. You must maintain the counter-revolution with all your might, and slowly allow your second soul core to form its own world within the control of your first soul core. This will make it truly independent, and immunize itself from the disruption of the first soul core. Then, it can improve and strengthen to reach the same standard as your first soul core. Once the strengths of your two soul cores are similar, there’ll be one major conflict. During this conflict, an explosive-like fusion will occur. If it succeeds, your second soul core will be formed. From there, an extremely strong twin soul core balanced by Yin and Yang will be formed. If you fail, you die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stunned. Even though this was just Elder Xuan’s description, he could already sense how difficult it was to achieve such a balance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Surely there isn’t anyone who’s chosen this method, right? It’s too dangerous. Furthermore, what will it be like even if you succeed, given that your two soul cores are revolving in opposite directions? Wouldn’t there always be a conflict within your body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan smiled and shook his head, “There are still those who try. Although I’ve never heard of any human soul master succeeding as of yet, the twin soul core that’s formed is the strongest if success is attained. Let me ask you, how should a whirlpool move such that it’s at its fastest speed?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was puzzled as he asked, “Isn’t it just by revolving?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan replied, “The correct answer is a combination of push and pull. Think about it. If two whirlpools move in two opposite directions, what will happen between these two whirlpools? Any soul power that’s stuck between the two whirlpools will immediately form another whirlpool due to the opposing forces, but this new whirlpool will be forced away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening to Elder Xuan’s words, Huo Yuhao only heard a loud boom in his head. A very important doubt that he had had all this while was finally answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He said almost immediately, “Elder Xuan, did Di Tian use the Yin Yang Complement?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan was stunned. “You actually guessed it. That’s right. He did use that method. That’s why he’s so strong. The reason why he succeeded was because he had been accumulating his strength for a long time. Furthermore, he’s physically strong. As for how he did it, I’m not sure. However, I think he’s the only one who has succeeded among all the known individuals and soul beasts. As a result, it’s without a doubt that he’s the strongest among all Ultimate Douluo. If he fights with all his strength, I don’t think Long Xiaoyao and Ye Xishui would be his match even if they combined forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian had always been Huo Yuhao’s goal. The more he understood this Beast God, the more he felt how terrifying he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had actually used the Yin Yang Complement to form his twin soul core. As he thought of how Di Tian circulated his soul power, it all made sense to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, his soul power appears as small whirlpools. That must be the effect of a balance of Yin and Yang. Each of those small whirlpools contains immense soul power. Compared to ordinary an Ultimate Douluo, the amount of soul power he can store is much greater. No wonder even his projection can scare off Ye Xishui. He’s indeed the Beast God!</span></p>
