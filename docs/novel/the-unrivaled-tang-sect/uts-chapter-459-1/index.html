 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Beast God Di Tian wanted this strength back in the Great Star Dou Forest. The Skydream Iceworm was far too valuable, and this origin power wasn’t something that Di Tian could take without the Skydream Iceworm’s consent. Therefore, the Beast God had gathered other savage beasts to absorb the Skydream Iceworm’s soul power that he had obtained after so many years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the beginning, the Skydream Iceworm brought his own origin power into Huo Yuhao’s body when he had first fused with him. Huo Yuhao’s cultivation had thus been able to improve continuously, and his spiritual power’s exponential qualitative change all had to do with the Skydream Iceworm’s origin power. Otherwise, how could his body transform so smoothly?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Skydream Iceworm didn’t give all his origin power to Huo Yuhao, because his body’s capacity was far from enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was another, more important thing that Huo Yuhao didn’t know. As long as the Skydream Iceworm maintained his origin power and kept it from dissipating, then the Skydream Iceworm could still choose another human to merge with, even if Huo Yuhao passed away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this moment, when the Skydream Iceworm decided to fuse his most valuable possession into Huo Yuhao’s body, Huo Yuhao and he could no longer be separated. Either Huo Yuhao finally stepped onto the path of becoming a God, or he would live and die with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was, the Skydream Iceworm had long contemplated fusing his origin power with Huo Yuhao when Huo Yuhao had first interacted with the God Realm a long time ago. What Huo Yuhao’s body could bear was sufficient. However, the Ice Empress had stopped him. The Skydream Iceworm should wait until a crucial moment, and give him his origin power when Huo Yuhao was breaking through. That would be much more effective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wasn’t this the important opportunity they were waiting for? The Skydream Iceworm didn’t expect this moment to arrive so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul beasts cultivated differently from humans. Therefore, they couldn’t guide Huo Yuhao in this respect. However, both the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress were some of the strongest people in the world, and they all possessed incredibly strong abilities within their domains. Of course, they could see that this moment was an incredible opportunity for improvement to Huo Yuhao. An opportunity like this only came once in a blue moon; at the very least, such opportunities were considerably rare. It would be a pity to miss it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm’s origin power was incredibly strong, a pure and perfect fusion between spiritual power and soul power. The Skydream Iceworm had completely discarded his element of ice when he was helping Huo Yuhao construct his second martial soul. The Skydream Iceworm only had pure soul power and spiritual power at this moment. It meant he was the most suitable for helping Huo Yuhao form his first soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan’s eyes were wide with astonishment. Huo Yuhao was already almost overcome with weakness, but the enormous Iceworm’s appearance behind his back enabled his spirit to swiftly recover, while his soul power was being unleashed at an exponentially quicker rate, and continuously as well. It didn’t take long before the volume of the solid-state soul power he had created was comparable to that of a Soul Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was just unbelievable, the first time that Elder Xuan had seen such a thing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though a powerful martial soul can help soul masters store a certain amount of soul power, Huo Yuhao is storing far more than he should be able to. Furthermore, his two martial souls are the Spirit Eyes and the Ice Empress Jade Scorpion. What is with this huge worm? Does this mean that Spirits can help soul masters store even more soul power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan shook his head in exasperation.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Prodigies and geniuses cultivate in a different fashion from what is the norm, after all. I’ll just wait and see to what stage he can reach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cracks around the funnel-shaped solid soul power began to turn gold, while the black hues that belonged to spatial cracks began to appear within the golden colors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To his surprise, Huo Yuhao realized that when his spiritual power reached a certain level inside the solid-state soul power, it was just like the fusion of soul power and spiritual power inside his own body. The state of his soul power was very similar to when he was unleashing his Three Ultimate Haodong Skills, while the only difference was that his soul power was now solid instead of liquid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seems like solid-state soul power is still a reflection of my own ability after all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao realized some even stranger things right at this moment. The solid soul power was still absorbing his soul power and spiritual power, while Huo Yuhao could still hang on with the Skydream Iceworm replenishing him. This solid soul power was starting to absorb more than just those two things… It was actually gradually absorbing the spatial power contained within the cracks in space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this where the secrets of creating the combination lie?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao widened his eyes, and was working hard to control everything while observing closely at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, it’s like that!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The solid soul power was clearly swallowing the spatial power contained within the cracks in space. It was very strange. The cracks in space became increasingly larger as their spatial power was absorbed, while even more spatial power filled them. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was being expended at an exponentially faster rate, while the wild and violent spatial power was tearing at his spiritual power. Huo Yuhao wouldn’t have been able to hang on if not for his Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time continued to pass. The Skydream Iceworm that was almost material behind his back also became increasingly illusory. The Iceworm’s origin power had already integrated into the solid soul power through Huo Yuhao’s body. Even if his experiment ultimately ended in failure, the origin energy of heaven and earth would be very beneficial for him, especially with respect to his fusion of soul power and spiritual power. The Skydream Iceworm would truly become his Spirit after everything ended, and they would be inseparable, just like the Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm’s origin power coming from behind him became increasingly weak. Huo Yuhao could feel his body descending into weakness once more, and he grit his teeth as he tried his best to hang on. Even though he didn’t know what kind of price the Skydream Iceworm was paying, Huo Yuhao could still feel his weakness.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Brother Skydream has given so much to help me... I have to hold on, no matter what!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He clenched his teeth and continued releasing more spiritual power. There was nothing he could do about his soul power, so he could only keep working through spiritual power. The spiritual power in his spiritual sea flowed as if it were limitless, and even more strangely, the aura of destiny within his Eye of Destiny seemed to become stronger. A faint shadow of the Three-Eyed Golden Lion actually surfaced behind his back and enveloped his entire being in a layer of rose-gold colors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was giving his all in this moment. If he failed at compressing his soul core, he would be severely injured, and this could possibly end in worse injuries than when all his passageways were shattered. In the end, he even used all of his own origin power that he could control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cracks in space became increasingly strong. The contortions and ripples in space, along with that strange sensation, were all deeply imprinted into Huo Yuhao’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t easy to sense spatial undulations from day to day. One could create those cracks in space with forceful attacks, but those cracks would only appear for an instant before disappearing again, so sensing and studying them would be impossible. However, those spatial undulations were appearing around his compressed solid-state soul power continuously and finely. They were closely related to his soul power and spiritual power, so studying and sensing them became very easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beads of nervous sweat began to appear on Elder Xuan’s forehead. Elder Xuan could tell that Huo Yuhao was continuously releasing soul power and spiritual power, and every possible strength in his body was reaching its respective limit. Elder Xuan also understood that he would inflict heavy damage to Huo Yuhao if he interrupted him at such a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But fusing with the mixture wasn’t as simple as creating it. The individual’s body had to be able to bear the mixture! Huo Yuhao had only recently become a Soul Sage, and he had just sustained severe injuries. Could he really absorb the soul core into his body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cracks in space on the surface of the solid soul power became closely woven like a web. Black cracks appeared continuously, and the solid-state soul power’s absorption and rotation speed were nearing their absolute limits. All space was being completely distorted around it, and all Huo Yuhao could see was a ball of gold, rose-gold, and black merged together into a strange sphere, which contained frightening soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Come! Collapse!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao roared in his heart, and he transformed the meager remainder of his spiritual power into Spiritual Shock before he fused that entirely into the solid-state soul power. It was at this time that the Skydream Iceworm behind him released every last bit of his origin power. The Skydream Iceworm transformed into a beam of flowing light, reintegrated into his body, and vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Success would be determined in this exact moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The solid-state soul power quivered faintly. Huo Yuhao had a strange feeling in this moment that the solid-state soul power, which was rotating ever so quickly, had suddenly stopped; it went from extreme motion to extreme motionlessness. This sudden sensation made him depressed. However, Huo Yuhao felt as if everything had grown blurry around him in the next moment, as if he were now within the starry skies, and only that gentle spatial power was around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Space suddenly collapsed in that instant, as if everything was collapsing together with his body as the epicenter, while terrifying spatial power immediately tore his body to pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his body reformed itself after it was torn to pieces, and his consciousness returned. Huo Yuhao saw to his surprise that the solid-state soul power had collapsed into a black hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao only took one look before he felt as if his soul were about to be sucked in. There was endless darkness inside the black hole, and boundless unknowns, but he couldn’t feel the kind of soul power contained within it at all. However, he could clearly feel a connection &nbsp;resembling a bridge between the black hole and himself!</span></p>
