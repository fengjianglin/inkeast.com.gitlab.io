 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright,” Huo Yuhao replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian was slightly stunned, and smiled. “Alright, take some time to figure things out.” After he finished speaking, he also returned to Clear Sky Castle. When he reached the gate, he left the gate open for some time before he entered. After that, Niu Tian’s furious groans resonated from inside the castle. “Tai Tan, come out. Your fart is too smelly. I’m going to teach you a lesson.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao finally laughed. These two sect masters were really interesting, and they were really warm at heart. Huo Yuhao felt very good as they slowly accepted him. Although Tai Tan was fierce towards him, he didn’t use any attacks or restrictive soul skills against him during their sparring. He had acted like a target board and allowed Huo Yuhao to attack him! Otherwise, Huo Yuhao wouldn’t have been able to use any of his soul skills, given Tai Tan’s cultivation.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I must work hard and improve my coordination with the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He checked his condition, starting with his remaining soul power. Even after the series of explosions, he still had more than half of his soul power left. His recovery was also rather quick. The chilly wind on Clear Sky Peak seemed to be a force that he could absorb. His soul power restorative abilities had increased by twenty percent compared to normal. Without a doubt, these were benefits brought about by the Snow Lady. As long as he was near a cold or moist environment, his restorative abilities would be greatly enhanced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, he could clearly sense that the Snowless Glacier didn’t deplete his soul power, but instead enabled its recovery. It was as if the attack was unleashed after he had absorbed all the strength in the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice. It was an unbelievably strong soul skill! Not only did the Snow Empress’ Spirit help to increase his fighting strength, but she also increased his ability to last in a fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao found a spot at the top of the mountain and sat cross-legged on the ground. He entered deep meditation. He needed to calm himself down to think about how he should better combine his own abilities with the Snow Empress’ Three Ultimate Techniques. In addition, he also pondered how he should use and control the changes the Snow Lady had brought to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was one thing he was certain of. If the battlefield was in the Extreme North, he was able to fight a seven-ringed Soul Sage with a Martial Soul True Body, given the Snow Lady’s immense strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Through this thinking process, Huo Yuhao immersed himself in a meditative state. It was very strange, but the wind and fog would disappear as they drifted in front of him. There was a layer of orange covering his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady seemed to adore this environment. She sat on Huo Yuhao’s shoulder, and even adopted a cross-legged position. As she sat there quietly, she looked like a ceramic doll. Only the subtle orange-gold light shining from her revealed how different she was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was immersed in his cultivation for two consecutive days. Niu Tian and Tai Tan didn’t bother him either, as they allowed him to comprehend on his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao rarely returned to his room. He spent most of his time on the mountain peak, looking at the sea of clouds and reminiscing over his teacher who had passed away. He also sensed the changes in his body. This carried on until…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m back!” A bright bluish-gold light appeared in the sky. Huo Yuhao subconsciously lifted his head to look at it, and saw Wang Dong descending from the sky towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao opened his mouth and said, “Why did you return from the sky? Can you fly so high using your martial soul? Conservative estimates put the Clear Sky Peak at three thousand meters high! Even a Titled Douluo can’t fly so high in the air. It might be possible if a Titled Douluo used a Class 9 flying-type soul tool. The higher the sky, the thinner the air. Soul masters need to breathe as they regulate their soul power. Even if your martial soul has wings, you can’t possibly fly so high.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong laughed mysteriously. “This is a secret of the Clear Sky Sect. I can’t tell you unless you’re one of us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “If I hadn’t joined the Tang Sect, I could’ve joined the Clear Sky Sect. However, I evidently can’t join your sect now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong replied, “That doesn’t have to be the case. There might be some other way in the future. Let’s not talk about that though. Did you miss me these few days I was gone?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed. “Why would I miss you? You’re not even a girl. If you introduce your sister to me, I might miss her instead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong snorted. “Look at how you choose lust over friendship.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chortled. “So what? What benefits have you gained from this trip?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong straightened both his index and middle fingers. “Settled!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao asked, “What soul skill?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong replied, “It’s a secret. You’ll know when you return from the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. You just need to know that it’s very strong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed mysteriously and said, “Alright, it’s fine if you don’t tell me. I also have a secret, but I’m not sure whether you’re interested in listening to it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What secret?” Wang Dong was curious as he looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao mimicked his words. “You’ll know when I return from the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. You just need to know that it’s very strong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Wang Dong snorted furiously. “I went all the way to the Sun Moon Empire to find you. Did you think it was easy? You’re still playing such a trick on me? Are you still human?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uh…” Huo Yuhao found it very amusing when he saw Wang Dong putting his hands on his waist with a displeased look. “Alright, I’ll show you. Snow Lady, come out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao called, and an orange-gold light suddenly flashed. The Snow Lady flew out, and her white undergarment moved slightly. She floated between Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong while facing the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Snow Lady appeared, Wang Dong was stunned. As he saw her, the look in his eyes became gentler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wow, what a cute lady. What’s going on?” Wang Dong asked as he reached out to touch her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No.” Huo Yuhao warned him. After what had happened to Tai Tan, he was afraid that she would hurt Wang Dong. She wasn’t harmless! Even if she didn’t use soul skills along with Huo Yuhao, she was still comparable to a Soul King on her own. She was even at the level of a Soul King with the Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao was astonished to discover that the Snow Lady wasn’t resistant towards Wang Dong. She allowed him to touch her delicate face. After that, she crawled her way into his arms and allowed him to carry her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She took one second to win Wang Dong over. Wang Dong looked like a girl from the way he looked at her. “She’s too cute. Her skin is so smooth! It’s very nice to touch. Give me a kiss.” As he spoke, he placed her in front of his lips and pecked her cheek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady laughed and didn’t resist. She returned his kiss. Wang Dong twisted his head suddenly and allowed her to peck his cheek. He also said very sternly, “You can’t kiss there. Men and women can’t be in such close contact.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was amused. “You’ve already hugged and kissed her before you told her that men and women can’t be in such close contact. What’s going on, Snow Lady? You’re so young but you’ve already set your eyes on handsome guys? You don’t even want your daddy now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Daddy? You’re her daddy?” Wang Dong’s eyes widened, and he shot Huo Yuhao a weird look. If Huo Yuhao had to describe this look, he would say that it was aggressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you so agitated? It’s just her way of referring to me. Snow Lady, come back.” Huo Yuhao was slightly jealous. He was a little unhappy seeing how close the Snow Lady and Wang Dong were.</span></p>

After that, he took a step in front of him and stared at him furiously. His voice was trembling as he asked, “When did you have a daughter? Tell me!”</span></p>

You are letting me and my sister down!”</span></p>

What does this have to do with your sister or Ju Zi? Didn’t you hear what I called her?”</span></p>

Although he had been very honest to the sect masters, there were many things he hadn’t told Wang Dong. He was a little apologetic right now. “There are some things that I need to tell you.”</span></p>

Don’t tell me.” After he finished speaking, he ran towards Clear Sky Castle.</span></p>

Why was Wang Dong so abnormal? He couldn’t just let Wang Dong run away, however, and thus he pursued him. The Snow Lady offered him help. She pointed forward, and a streak of deep blue light flashed. The gate of Clear Sky Castle was frozen shut.</span></p>

He stopped and looked at Huo Yuhao before glancing at the Snow Lady. He said, “Alright, tell me.”</span></p>

He even recounted how he had met the Ice Empress in the Extreme North. He only excluded the secret regarding the Skydream Iceworm.</span></p>
