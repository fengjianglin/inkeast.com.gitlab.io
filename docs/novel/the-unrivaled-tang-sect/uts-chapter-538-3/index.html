 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-daaf2d9f-7fff-faf0-fa53-ef5dc02285cf"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the armor of dragon scales fitted itself onto Tang Wutong, her aura suddenly changed. Her powerful dragon aura blew away the Mass Enfeeblement. Even the dangerous Spiritual Confusion was blocked by the golden trident on her forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The shiny Golden Dragon Spear appeared and blocked the Unparalleled Chill’s blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Clinggg!” Once again, another bright sound echoed through the air. The Unparalleled Chill shattered in mid-air, while Tang Wutong also fell to the ground from the impact, her entire body covered with a layer of frost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had been working on his Ultimate Ice, especially after he had absorbed the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence previously. After the Unparalleled Chill shattered, it released the extremely low temperature trapped within it. The soul engineers who were watching the duel felt the sudden drop in temperature, and quickly mustered their soul power to warm their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao let out a long growl as he accelerated instead of retreating. He flew towards Tang Wutong as he pulled his right hand to his waist. The image of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion appeared behind his back as a Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass formed on his shoulder. These increased the aura of his Ultimate Ice by orders of magnitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, Tang Wutong fearlessly tapped the ground with her feet. Following which, a gigantic golden dragon appeared with a loud dragon roar. Afterwards, the dragon shrank rapidly, and wrapped itself around the Golden Dragon Spear. Tang Wutong pointed the tip of the spear at Huo Yuhao as both of them prepared for the other’s next move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the blink of an eye, both of them were inches apart. But suddenly, both of their figures vanished simultaneously. At that very instant, the surrounding soul masters felt the effects of a powerful suction force. The suction force seemed to penetrate their minds as most of the soul masters were forced to take a step forward to steady their bodies. They were struggling against the power of the suction force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But then, in the next instant, both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong reappeared in the other’s former positions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them revealed a shocked expression on their faces. Following which, both their expressions revealed a look of amazement.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I can’t believe we have so much chemistry. We’re even using the same technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like both of them had executed Instant Teleportation at the same time. They had both wanted to teleport to the other person’s back before launching an attack. But it seemed like both of them had foiled the other’s plan unintentionally. Even their tactics were exactly the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was lost for words after he realized this, whereas Tang Wutong burst into laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even then, their emotions would not get into the way of their fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After teleporting to where Huo Yuhao was, Tang Wutong spun around as her Golden Dragon Spear lashed back like a whip towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao moved as he barely dodged the jab from Tang Wutong’s spear. The current situation was starting to show the advantage that weapon wielders had over soul masters who did not wield weapons. Because Huo Yuhao did not have a weapon, he could only react passively to Tang Wutong’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After barely dodging the attack from her spear, Huo Yuhao placed his right palm above the tip of the Golden Dragon Spear as he pressed it downwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Tang Wutong injected her strength into the spear in an explosive manner. This sudden imbalance in energy caused Huo Yuhao to be tossed aside as though he had just been electrocuted. In addition, his hand was bursting with light and energy. It was apparent that he had expended copious amounts of soul power to barely block off the lifesteal ability of Tang Wutong’s Golden Dragon Spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, after suffering from a blow from the Snowless Glacier, the glow on the Golden Dragon Spear became slightly fainter. However, the golden dragon light, which had wrapped itself around the spear, suddenly intensified as it forced the cold aura out of the spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once again, Tang Wutong’s body released an unbelievable amount of golden light as her soul power intensified once more. As she flapped the wings behind her back, she chased after Huo Yuhao like a comet. It took her no time at all to appear behind his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In their previous collision, Huo Yuhao was undoubtedly the loser. He was at a disadvantage because he did not have a weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was not about to let him catch his breath. A golden dragon head appeared in front of her chest and dragon let out a low roar. A streak of golden light emerged from the dragon’s mouth as it shot straight towards Huo Yuhao. Dragon God’s Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s fifth soul skill was the skill which made the evil soul master suffer a lot previously. It was going to be very difficult for Huo Yuhao to evade this attack when it was fired at such a short distance from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s tactics could be said to be very unpredictable. Just when everyone thought that she was about to begin a close-combat battle with Huo Yuhao after chasing after him, she suddenly released a ranged skill. And this ranged attack was released precisely before Huo Yuhao could predict her next move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Huo Yuhao could use his spiritual detection to predict Tang Wutong’s moves, he was supposed to be able to know what she was about to do next. However, Tang Wutong now possessed superior soul power, and her attacks were unprecedentedly unpredictable. She was undoubtedly trying to reduce the advantage of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual detection by trying to be as unpredictable as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being knocked away by the previous blow, he landed in a position where he could look straight at Tang Wutong. As he saw the golden streak of light from the Dragon God’s Roar coming towards him, his face revealed a faint smile—much to everyone’s surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, Huo Yuhao’s eyes brightened as his hands made a hugging motion in front of his chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, a strange scene unfolded before their eyes. The airflow around his body suddenly became very violent and rapid. It was suddenly infused with an agitated Ultimate Ice aura as it formed a whirlpool around his body. He extended his left hand outwards while retracting his right hand as an icy blue whirlpool formed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Booommm!” A violet humming sound reverberated across the sparring ground. Once again, Huo Yuhao was thrown backwards before he slowed himself with his feet. However, Tang Wutong was no longer able to chase after him. Her body paused in mid-air as her eyes revealed her shock at what had just happened. A layer of ice had formed on her Dragon God’s Armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong shook her body as though the Dragon God itself was shaking its armor. The layer of ice shattered, but her speed was visibly slower than before. Huo Yuhao also took this opportunity to catch his breath. As he looked at Tang Wutong, he slowly raised his right hand as a tornado suddenly formed around his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was not any normal tornado. If one were to be precise, it was an Ice Snow Tornado.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tornado’s diameter was only about five meters. But it was as tall as the heavens as it stood towering above everyone, with its top beyond anyone’s field of view. Huo Yuhao seemed to have disappeared within the tornado.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong's eyes narrowed as she paused momentarily. She did not immediately attack as she let out a cold battle-cry. She raised the Golden Dragon Spear which she was wielding with her right hand as she pointed it at the tornado. At the same time, her small frame exploded with an invincible aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Huo Yuhao had never seen this aura that Tang Wutong had just released. She released the pair of wings behind her back. At this instant, she seemed to have become a circle. With her body as the center of a greater circle, a blinding purple-gold glow illuminated her surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The diameter of this purple-gold glow was a good ten meters. After its appearance, almost the entire spectral demiplane’s aura seemed to have become agitated and more violent. If one were to pay attention to Tang Wutong’s soul rings, one would notice that her eighth soul ring had just lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s body disappeared as though she had transformed into a beautiful butterfly flying within the humongous purple-gold glow. At this instant, it seemed like the spectral demiplane had a sun for the first time, a beautiful purple-gold sun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi’s jaw dropped as he witnessed the sight before him. “That’s way too insane. What the hell are they trying to do? They have been executing impossibly difficult moves one after another. Ji Juechen, are you still planning to challenge Wutong? I think they might still have some cards up their sleeves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen had a worried look on his face. In his mind, he knew that he might have stood a chance against the previous moves that Tang Wutong had executed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But after he saw the purple-gold sun before his eyes, he knew that there was an impossible gap between them. In order to bridge this gap, he first had to attain the rank of a Titled Douluo. But was it really that easy to move from eight to nine rings? Ji Juechen’s martial soul was not considered a strong one. It was more than just a game of probability as to whether he could get his soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, the soul skill that Tang Wutong had just executed was her eighth soul skill—Dragon Dance of the Radiant Sun. It was an immensely powerful offensive soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the purple-gold sun slowly rose into the sky, the Radiant Dragon God’s Butterfly danced within its glow. As the sun climbed higher into the sky, the pressure it released became even greater. All the soul masters who were watching the battle started to retreat from the area. No one wanted to be injured by this powerful soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless spectral creatures which were prowling around the other end of the spectral demiplane howled in fear as though they were being attacked by the sun’s glow. All of them started to flee as far as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the Ice Snow Tornado that Huo Yuhao had created stood proud and tall. As the soul masters started to retreat further from the sparring ground, its size started to grow as it became more powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, watch my Dragon Dance of the Radiant Sun!” Tang Wutong warned Yuhao. In the next instant, the brightness of the sun grew to its maximum. Following which, a gigantic purple-gold pillar of light tore the sky apart as it raced towards Huo Yuhao’s Ice Snow Tornado.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, before the sun’s blow even reached the tornado, the Ice Snow Tornado suddenly disintegrated. That was something no one had expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had vanished. He was replaced by two figures who were holding each other’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One was white as snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other was pale as ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice and Snow Empress were holding each other’s hands as they carried a smile on their pretty faces. A similarly gigantic beam of light was released from their bodies as it accelerated towards Tang Wutong’s Dragon Dance of the Radiant Sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This pillar was formed from the combination of the pure white color of snow and the pale jade color of ice. The two tones of light blended perfectly with one another as they released an invincible aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! This was the most powerful soul skill that Huo Yuhao had acquired after fusing with the Snow Empress. It was a skill that came with his Ice Jade Empress Scorpion martial soul’s fifth soul ring. Ice and Snow Empress' Arrogance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A radiant sight unfolded before everyone’s eyes. After colliding with one another, both the purple-gold glow and the ice jade glow exploded into sparks which flew everywhere as the burning brightness of the sun fought the intense cold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This collision caused the entire world to be shaken as the spectral demiplane trembled, and radiant sparks lingered in the air for an extended period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul masters had long become dazed from watching the battle before their eyes. Even though these blows were not targeted at them, they could still feel the frightening power within those attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this the strength of a top-class cultivator? What would happen if we were the ones receiving these blows?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took a good ten seconds before the collision of the two soul skills to start showing signs of subsiding. In the end, the fight between Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao came to a deadlock. Neither of them could overwhelm the other.</span></p>
