His smile widened a little. “If you are trying to play dumb, take good care to ensure that you don’t become the dumb one. Honestly speaking, the Academy has nothing else to teach you anymore. Since you want to leave, just leave. I only have one request: please send news of your safety once every three months, regardless of what method you use.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chortled. “Definitely. I won’t be impatient when I deal with things in the future. I’ll be steadier, and won’t make you worry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan said, “Remember, no matter what trouble you face, the Academy will always back you up. Always stay true to yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan leaned back into his chair as he retrieved a huge wine gourd. As he opened it, a strong fragrance of wine filled the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned. Ever since Elder Xuan became the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion, Huo Yuhao had not seen him drink like this. He couldn’t help but recall the days when Elder Xuan would hold a wine gourd in one hand and a chicken drumstick in the other hand. He had been under huge pressure over the past few years in the Sea God’s Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After downing a few mouthfuls of wine, Elder Xuan looked more vibrant, “It feels great! I haven’t drunk like this in a long time. Over these few years, the situation in the continent has been very uncertain. The Sun Moon Empire has grown to be very strong, and Xu Tianran dared to ignore all considerations, going as far as to lay his hands on the competitors of the Youth Soul Master Tournament. This shows how confident he is in his own abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Originally, I didn’t think too much about it. No matter how strong the Sun Moon Empire was, I thought that it was only slightly stronger than the Star Luo Empire. Even so, the Sun Moon Empire shouldn’t be too strong. If the three empires in the Douluo Continent teamed up, along with the presence of Heaven’s Wrath to defend us, what could they do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, I only realized I was wrong after this war. The presence of soul tools is indeed an important factor affecting how wars are fought. As the beast wave raged and the soul beast army charged towards Shrek City, we managed to survive for two days with only ten thousand people, three thousand soul masters, and soul tools. We weren’t even fully equipped with soul tools then! In such a large-scale war, one’s individual abilities are unlikely to affect the outcome unless they are as powerful as Di Tian. How were we able to survive? We survived because of soul tools!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In total, we had less than fifty Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons. With the Tang Sect’s All-Terrain Self-Driving Forts and all types of soul tools from the Academy, we formed a crossfire that managed to resist the onslaught of the soul beast army. Those stationary soul cannon shells that the Tang Sect provided even caused greater losses to the soul beasts. If they hadn’t been battered so heavily, I believe the Great Star Dou Forest wouldn’t have compromised, even with our Spirits. Their goal was very simple: launch an all-out attack to weaken our abilities! The more soul masters they killed, the safer the soul beasts would be for a period of time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I originally looked down on soul tools, as I felt that the strength of a soul tool, even if it was Class 9, might not be as strong as an all-out attack from a Titled Douluo. However, I discovered that I was wrong. If a hundred soul masters attack at the same time, it’s very difficult for their power to add up together. However, the attacks of a hundred soul tools can be extremely destructive if they’re coordinated well. Furthermore, the future of soul tools is that they’ll be controlled by ordinary people, according to the Tang Sect’s research. If this really comes true, humans will still rule the Douluo Continent, even if soul masters cease to exist.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao understood what Elder Xuan meant through his tone. He was stunned as he asked, “Elder Xuan, are you adopting a pessimistic attitude towards the war between the three empires and the Sun Moon Empire?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan laughed slightly. “I’m not pessimistic. It’s just difficult to judge. However, it’ll depend on the younger people from the three empires to defeat the Sun Moon Empire. Go on, your experiences in the outside world will be very beneficial to your growth. Don’t worry about the Tang Sect. The Academy will do its best to support the sect. The growth of the Tang Sect might actually be what we need to resist the Sun Moon Empire in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s great. Elder Xuan, I’ll leave first. I hope that you can achieve success.” Huo Yuhao stood up and bowed respectfully to Elder Xuan. He only left the Sea God’s Pavilion after Elder Xuan gave him the signal to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t rush to leave. He turned around before kneeling towards the Golden Tree again. After kowtowing three times, he drifted away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A teacher for a day, a father for a life. No matter the time, his respect for Elder Mu would never change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

Huo Yuhao quickly left the Academy and rushed over to the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thing he wanted to do the most now was to see Wang Dong’er. If the Clear Sky Sect allowed it, he would remain there to take care of Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, he had to settle many things before that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Huo Yuhao returned to the Tang Sect, the sect was extremely crowded. There were many more disciples in the Sect right now. Huo Yuhao felt that many of them were very familiar, they were probably from the Academy. Furthermore, there weren’t just students from the Soul Tool Department, there were also students from the Martial Soul Department. Of course, there were some unfamiliar faces, too!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The outer wall of the Sect had already been torn down. It seemed like their territory had been expanded once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was extremely notable in Shrek City right now. To avoid unnecessary trouble, he used his Imitation, concealed himself in the air, and entered the inner hall of the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

Oh yes, proceed according to the blueprint for this side too. Use the best materials and don’t cut any corners. Otherwise, Teacher Xuan will ‘take care’ of all of you. Alright, that’s all. Get busy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he entered, Huo Yuhao heard He Caitou’s voice. He Caitou had retained his original appearance and seemed to be very busy. There were a few people dressed in construction gear beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he smiled, Huo Yuhao stopped using his Imitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou subconsciously turned in his direction. When he saw Huo Yuhao, he couldn’t help but rub his eyes, wanting to ensure that he wasn’t seeing things. It was only after he confirmed that it was really Huo Yuhao that he shouted in delight, “Little junior, you’re finally back!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he charged forward and hugged Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone from the Tang Sect was anxious after Huo Yuhao was taken away by Di Tian. However, even Elder Xuan was helpless, given Di Tian’s cultivation. The Tang Sect could only choose to wait. Fortunately, they knew that Huo Yuhao wasn’t in any immediate danger due to the presence of Spirits. Right now, He Caitou was delighted because Huo Yuhao had returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little junior, are you fine?” He Caitou looked very concerned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chortled, “Second senior, do I look like I’m not fine? Didn’t you say that the Tang Sect was given a larger plot of land in the outer city? Why are you still renovating this place?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou chuckled and replied, “We planned this after discussing it with the Academy. Yes, we were given a larger plot of land in the outer city. However, it’s much safer here, since it’s close to the Academy! We decided to renovate this place and turn it into a Soul Tool Research Institute. After this, we’ll move the other things, such as our working area and soul tool manufacturing factory, to the outer city. We’ll leave everything important in the inner city. In the future, Teacher Xuan will hold the fort inside the city and conduct holistic research.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This time, the Academy has become much more invested in the Sect. They’ve shared all their resources in the Soul Tool Department with us, especially in the area of soul tool research. They’ve given unconditional support to Teacher Xuan. Whatever Teacher Xuan needs, the Academy will try its best to gather.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed, “That’s great, then! I’m relieved. Second senior, where’s eldest senior?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou answered, “He’s around. He has been very worried about you these few days. He keeps going to the Academy to try to find a way to save you. Now that you’re back, I’m sure he’ll be delighted. Let’s go and find him.”</span></p>

Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan and Xiao Xiao were all in the outer city, overseeing the construction of the Tang Sect’s new building.</span></p>

When he saw Huo Yuhao, Bei Bei was naturally extremely delighted. Huo Yuhao recounted everything he had experienced in the Great Star Dou Forest to Bei Bei. He only concealed the future influence of Di Tian’s Black Dragon reverse scale on him. After all, it was unimportant to the Tang Sect, and it was only a problem that would slowly arise once he became a Titled Douluo. He didn’t want to make Bei Bei worry about him.</span></p>

He nodded quickly.</span></p>

It’s the same situation with the Academy. If she’s fine, she’ll still be in the Sun Moon Empire. It’s just that the evil energy that you helped to dispel from her body…”</span></p>

It’ll depend on her willpower. I believe she’ll be fine. It’s just that I don’t know why she hasn’t returned.” Ma Xiaotao was still the Holy Lady of the Holy Ghost Church, and a Soul Douluo with an Ultimate martial soul. As long as she didn’t expose her identity, no one could easily harm her inside the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
