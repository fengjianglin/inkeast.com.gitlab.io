 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao was carrying Ye Xishui. There was a mysterious glow on Ye Xishui’s face as she stared at Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. Surprisingly, she seemed to be very calm about the whole thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s talk later and leave now!” This was the first thing Long Xiaoyao said after seeing Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Prior to this, just when the barrier formed by the high-energy compression array soul tools had disappeared, Huo Yuhao had received a transmitted message from Long Xiaoyao. He had been told by Long Xiaoyao to cover him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that instant, Huo Yuhao actually hesitated. Even though he had only heard Long Xiaoyao’s voice, he felt that Ye Xishui was probably still alive. If he were to save Long Xiaoyao, he would also end up saving Ye Xishui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he decided after a short moment that favors and grudges were meant to be settled separately. He should return the favor to Long Xiaoyao before thinking about how he should exact his revenge on Ye Xishui. Even if Long Xiaoyao were to try and stop him, he would never let Ye Xishui get away scot-free. After all, it would be disastrous to let an evil soul master who was also an Ultimate Douluo get away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chaotic explosions continued for a good fifteen minutes before they ended. By then, both Xu Tianran and Ju Zi were already very anxious. In fact, goosebumps had already formed on Xu Tianran’s skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the Dragon Emperor Douluo and the Death God Douluo were still somehow able to survive, he would definitely not be able to bear the consequences. In fact, no one would be able to take their wrath. The entire Sun Moon Empire would probably be destroyed by their rage and fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ju Zi, do you think they’re dead?” Xu Tianran turned around and looked at Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dead, they must be dead!” Ju Zi exclaimed with determination. This was the first time she sensed cowardice from Xu Tianran. He was actually afraid of what might happen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, they must be dead. They have to be dead.” Xu Tianran exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, all of Radiant City had been locked down by the soldiers and soul engineers. However, their methods were useless against Huo Yuhao. Once he unleashed his Imitation, no one would be able to detect him, or the people whom he was bringing along with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After traveling for a good fifty kilometers—which was but a short moment for a Transcendent Douluo—Huo Yuhao stopped within a small forest. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had to stop now. In fact, at this instant, he revealed a very serious and solemn expression. He was about to face a very difficult problem. Even though he really did not want to confront it, he knew he had to settle it now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing how Huo Yuhao had stopped, Tang Wutong naturally stopped moving. She held hands with him as both of them turned around. Long Xiaoyao had been following behind them while carrying Ye Xishui on his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, Huo Yuhao noticed how Long Xiaoyao’s scales had turned dark red. His old face had also become very red. However, it was not a healthy kind of red. In Huo Yuhao’s eyes, all he saw was the aura of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s true! Even an Ultimate Douluo should not be able to come out alive from those frightening explosions. Long Xiaoyao and Ye Xishui are already more than two hundred years old, and are definitely past their peak. Hence, they should be in an extremely dire state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao placed Ye Xishui onto the ground gently as he propped her up to allow her to sit up straight. However, Ye Xishui raised one of her hands as she held onto Long Xiaoyao’s shoulder. She wanted to stand next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What surprised both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong was how Ye Xishui had seemed to become younger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao was right. Ye Xishui was very beautiful when she was younger. In fact, she did not pale in comparison to Tang Wutong at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gentle and radiant golden aura she was giving off made her seem very holy and sacred. This was exactly the same as the time Huo Yuhao had first seen Ye Guyi use her angel martial soul. Her skin was fair and porcelain-like. The smile she had on her face seemed to tell Huo Yuhao that she had let go of all of her grudges. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were very shocked by the transformation in her look and attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had no idea what the two Ultimate Douluo’s current states were. They only knew that both of them seemed to be behaving in a strange way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could still sense the pure and powerful soul power fluctuations from Ye Xishui’s body. She no longer seemed to have the aura that evil soul masters possessed. However, she didn’t seem to be radiating any life energy either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Long Xiaoyao’s body was still radiating fairly powerful life energy fluctuations. However, Huo Yuhao could tell that they were deteriorating, and were terribly unstable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Long.” Huo Yuhao forced himself to look at Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao sighed and said, “I know. There’s no chance that you will let Xishui go today. I understand where you’re coming from. Both of you should also be able to tell that we’re almost dead. However, I don’t know if I can fulfill my own wish before then. I had originally wanted you to find me after you reached Rank 98. But it seems like I’m running out of time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao kept silent. He had heard Long Xiaoyao’s story with Ye Xishui from Long Xiaoyao himself. In fact, he could understand the pain in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, can I ask something of you?” Long Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao remained silent before saying, “As long as it doesn’t involve me letting Senior Ye go, I can promise you any other thing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao knew that Ye Xishui and Long Xiaoyao would never be able to defeat him and Tang Wutong in their current state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao shook his head and said, “When I eventually die, I will naturally lose the ability to protect her. I just want you to promise me not to hurt her until I die. Can you kill her after I’ve died?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body froze. His heart was pained to see an Ultimate Douluo going down on his knees for something so simple!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hesitating for a short while, Huo Yuhao replied, “As long as Senior Ye doesn’t try to flee, I can definitely do what you have requested of me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao nodded and said, “You can rest assured that you will not regret accepting my request. I will definitely reward you for this.” As he spoke, he slowly turned around to face Ye Xishui. The look on his face was instantly replaced with the gentlest expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xishui, you are really very beautiful. You have remained so beautiful while I have aged so much.” His voice was very gentle as he spoke slowly. It was as though he was confessing something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui flashed a gentle smile on her beautiful face. “No, we have both aged. I never thought that I would be able to be with you until our last moments. I am so happy that things are ending this way. Don’t be sad. This is the best ending that I can get.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s voice started to tremble. “Xishui, have you really forgiven me? Are you really willing to forgive me for everything I did to you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui smiled. She seemed to be genuinely happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiaoyao, you’re really an idiot. In fact, it’s not just you. Mu En was also an idiot. Both of you are really idiots. Both of you have been played by me all this while! It’s just that both of you are too dumb to realize it. You’re really a big idiot!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though she was laughing, tears were pouring down her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why is that?” Long Xiaoyao stared blankly at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui sighed and said, “You gave way too much for me in this lifetime. Now that we have both reached the last moments of our lives, let me do something for you. Let me remove the baggage you have been carrying with you all this while, and leave our world happily. I can finally share a lot of things with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao was stunned. In fact, both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were stunned. What Ye Xishui was about to say was definitely something she had hidden with her life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you plan to tell me?” Long Xiaoyao asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui smiled plainly. “That thing. The thing you have always been feeling guilty about actually doesn’t exist. If I were to rephrase what I just said, I meant that you did not have to feel guilty about it. The reason is that I had planned it all along. The person whom I was waiting for was you all along—not Mu En. I was willing to be married to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you saying?” Long Xiaoyao could not believe what he had just heard. Huo Yuhao could see the fear in his eyes. Long Xiaoyao stared at Ye Xishui and said, “Xishui, stop it. Stop speaking. I don’t want you to spoil my impression of you. You were perfect back then, at least.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui shook her head and said, “No, I want to say everything. If I can’t let everything out, I can’t bear to die. Actually, you don’t have to worry about anything. Even though you had been protecting me by my side and were even being used by me for all these years, you had not lost anything. The reason is that you have been protecting a woman who loves you from the bottom of her heart. Do you know that?”</span></p>

Perhaps it was because of the current state of his body, but he was actually losing control of his emotions.</span></p>

Back then, I was already a part of the Holy Ghost Church. &nbsp;My sole intention was to identify the best talents among our generation. Hence, I met you and Mu En.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Both of you were so outstanding and powerful. In fact, I paled in comparison to both of you. All of us were young back then, and it was easy for us to get together. On top of that, I had an agenda for getting close to both of you. Hence, both of you fell in love with me unknowingly. At the same time, I had also fallen in love with one of you.”</span></p>

Now I can tell you truthfully that you’ve been a big idiot. I loved you right from the beginning. In fact, I had never liked Mu En.”</span></p>
