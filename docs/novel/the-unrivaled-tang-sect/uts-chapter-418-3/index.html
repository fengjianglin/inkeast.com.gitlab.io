Defeat me first.” As he spoke, he passed the uniform that he was holding over again.</span></p>

However, there were those who were still awake, too. Wang Xiaodian was one of them.</span></p>

After that, he covered himself with his blanket and just sat on his bed. I don’t know what he’s doing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “Alright.

Rather, he was thinking how he could help Dai Luoli improve his abilities.</span></p>

The next morning, the sound of a horn rang out to gather everyone as the first hint of dawn tinged the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was the first to jump out of bed, and he woke up all the new recruits from the First Bunk. All the recruits were whining as they got up, but quickly donned their uniforms before running out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli followed along. He had covered himself in his blanket the night before, and was in deep meditation. In the morning, he seemed pretty energetic, apart from the fact that he looked a little pale. He didn’t even glance at Huo Yuhao, and directly left their bunk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The initial training for recruits was simple and boring. It was either running or drills. In the afternoon, there was someone from the Military Law Department who came to talk to them about military law. The recruits were exhausted after an entire day of this. After dinner, even the energetic Wang Xiaodian immediately fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Dai Luoli were the exceptions.</span></p>

He smiled and said, “Let’s go! I’ll give you another chance today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go!” Dai Luoli immediately sprang up. As a soul master, the recruit training wasn’t too tiring for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them left the camp and went to the parade ground once again. To prevent detection, Huo Yuhao dragged Dai Luoli to a corner of the parade ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come on.” Huo Yuhao gestured towards Dai Luoli.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli had pondered yesterday’s bitter experience as he carried on with his training during the day. He thought about it for the entire day. He believed that he had lost to Huo Yuhao because he had been careless. He wasn’t going to repeat the same mistake twice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was why he was especially cautious today. In his opinion, he wouldn’t lose to Huo Yuhao if he was more careful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, was this really the case?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t have any intention of initiating an attack, and thus Dai Luoli had to be the proactive one. After observing carefully, he felt that Huo Yuhao had many flaws. His second soul ring shone, and a streak of white light shot out from his mouth towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was his White Tiger’s Fierce Light Wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When his White Tiger’s Fierce Light Wave was shot out, it took the shape of a halo and spread out. In terms of offensive strength, his Fierce Light Wave was naturally weaker than Dai Yueheng or Dai Huabin’s Fierce Light Wave. However, his Fierce Light Wave covered a larger area, and it even carried a spiritual-type attack with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pity that no one at the same level could compare to Huo Yuhao in terms of spiritual power, which meant that Dai Luoli was naturally inferior to Huo Yuhao in this aspect, too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s figure flashed, and he instantly turned illusory in Dai Luoli’s eyes. Dai Luoli was astonished. He had clearly locked onto his opponent before unleashing his soul skill, but he still missed. Huo Yuhao promptly reappeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Yuhao squatted down, Dai Luoli’s tiger claws extended out, and he clawed towards Huo Yuhao’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stopped charging forward and lifted his right foot. Instantly, he kicked both of Dai Luoli’s wrists. As Dai Luoli’s hands went numb, Huo Yuhao kicked out again, and Dai Luoli was knocked into the air before he crashed to the ground five meters away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli was able to take beatings after unleashing his White Tiger, and he had been thinking about how he could deal with Huo Yuhao for an entire day. As for Huo Yuhao, he was thinking of the fastest way to make his younger brother stronger. After pondering for some time, he thought that the best method was to copy the bluish-gold figure that he had faced in the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thrash him! He was going to give Dai Luoli a good thrashing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only after a good thrashing that Dai Luoli would remember this lesson for life. If he remembered this lesson for life, his abilities would naturally improve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, Huo Yuhao’s plan was to conduct individual training with Dai Luoli every night during this recruit training period.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli’s tragedy started the moment Huo Yuhao recognized him. At the very start, he didn’t believe that he couldn’t defeat an ordinary person as a soul master. However, as time passed, Huo Yuhao was always able to defeat him using his strength and speed no matter what methods he used. Huo Yuhao knew his limits, though. He hit Dai Luoli without causing him any real injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A recruit’s life was plain and exhausting, or at least this was the case for most recruits. Most of the recruits were fatigued because of the high-intensity training they were being subjected to. However, Dai Luoli’s life was very exciting, if being hit and battered all the time could be considered exciting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stood out during his recruit training. He was the best in almost every training component. The recruits in the First Bunk were slowly won over by him because of his abilityand the occasional help of his spiritual power. Huo Yuhao would also teach the new recruits some of the simpler techniques from the Tang Sect, and guide them in their training. His reputation in the First Bunk slowly rose. Under his leadership, the First Bunk, or rather the First Small Team, performed the best among all the small teams.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao walked to Dai Luoli’s side and patted his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every night, the two of them would go out. Huo Yuhao had come up with an excuse, which was that they were reporting to the large team leader.</span></p>

There was a complex look in his eyes.</span></p>

He had also been beaten up by Huo Yuhao for a month. It was pathetic! The only comfort he had was that Huo Yuhao was still kind enough to not hit his face, meaning he was still presentable in front of others. However, it wasn’t a good feeling being thrashed for a month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every time Dai Luoli saw the genial smile on Huo Yuhao’s face, he couldn’t help but shudder. It was like a recurring nightmare at this time every night.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao sat down beside his bed and smiled, “Why? Are you throwing a tantrum?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli glared at him, but didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao sighed faintly. “It’s fine if you don’t want to go. I’m going to find the large team leader and tell him you’re a soul master.” He spoke very softly so that only Dai Luoli could hear him clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Dai Luoli glared furiously at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

It’s become a pleasant habit for me. You’ll defeat me if you’re capable. Why is a big man like you acting as if you’re a coward?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet again!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli shut his eyes in pain. It wasn’t his first time rejecting Huo Yuhao. However, Huo Yuhao would threaten him with his vulnerability every time. Even though he knew that he shouldn’t be duped, his identity as a soul master was a double-edged sword. If he couldn’t defeat an ‘ordinary person’ like Huo Yuhao, how would he have the face to tell anyone he was a soul master?</span></p>

He even took the initiative to grab Dai Luoli’s shoulder and drag him towards the parade ground.</span></p>

Indeed, they knew each other. Using his spiritual power, he watched where they were walking.</span></p>

Before even saying anything, he kicked towards Huo Yuhao’s head. He hated Huo Yuhao. Not only did Huo Yuhao beat him up every day, but he would even use words to agitate him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao waved his right hand and blocked Dai Luoli’s leg. His right leg kicked out extremely quickly and subtly, managing to hit the ankle of Dai Luoli’s supporting leg.</span></p>

However, he unleashed his White Tiger as he fell back, supporting himself with his right hand before propping himself back up. After this, he shot out his White Tiger’s Fierce Light Wave at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could already guess what he was trying to do. Just as Dai Luoli unleashed his Fierce Light Wave, Huo Yuhao disappeared and somehow arrived at Dai Luoli’s side. He cut down with his right leg, aiming at Dai Luoli’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli roared, and his third soul ring was unleashed before he even finished using his Fierce Light Wave. His body expanded greatly, and his claws crossed each other as they slashed towards Huo Yuhao’s right leg. His claws were extremely sharp, and it was plain that he wanted to tear Huo Yuhao’s right leg to pieces.</span></p>
