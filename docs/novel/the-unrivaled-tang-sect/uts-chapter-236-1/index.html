 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

This was especially so because Zhong Liren was an evil soul master, and had the strength to challenge even a normal Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhong Liren began to feel that something was amiss from the moment their hands clasped together. Their auras were starting to rise exponentially, and the blinding golden light bursting from their bodies was tinged with faint dragon roars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s eyes had become entirely golden at this point. Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny was golden, but his own eyes had become dark blue in color, &nbsp;a hue that was filled with a chilling eeriness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could this aura belong to two people who only had five and six soul rings? Their soul power undulations were close to, or had already reached that of a seven-ringed Soul Sage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao quickly calmed down after his momentary shock. He was very experienced with martial soul fusion, and he swiftly analyzed their martial soul fusion’s strengths and weaknesses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Relative to his martial soul fusion with Wang Dong’er, their current fusion greatly amplified each other in terms of both strength and soul power, to the point where it exceeded his connection with Wang Dong’er through the Haodong power. However, he had no idea what kind of martial soul fusion skills he would create with Wang Qiu’er, but there could only be two. He was also positive that these martial soul fusion skills would absolutely be assault-based. He had four martial soul fusion skills with Wang Dong’er, and that was considered a lot more versatile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao analyzed the pros and cons, but he couldn’t be sure. However, he was sure that his fusion with Wang Qiu’er wasn’t that far off from his fusion with Wang Dong’er. This was an unexpected surprise, his confidence to survive this ordeal was greatly boosted with this martial soul fusion, as Zhong Liren had lost many beast souls during his previous battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhong Liren grunted coldly and raised his staff into the air as a horde of beast souls swarmed out in an instant, pouncing right towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er. His Ghostshadow Leopard Emperor vanished soundlessly into the air… or rather, it disappeared within the mass of beast souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao raised his right hand, and a dark blue longsword appeared in his palms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unparalleled Chill, Empress’ Sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, he would have to adjust his soul power and wait for a while after he unleashed his Empress’ Sword for a single strike, while this move consumed much of his soul power. However, his martial soul fusion with Wang Qiu’er allowed him to nearly solidify his Empress’ Sword to the point where it was almost physically material.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three beams of light erupted from Huo Yuhao’s three eyes at the same time. His Light of Destiny felt as if it was going to absorb all light around it, and his purplish-golden Spiritual Shock struck Zhong Liren at almost the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhong Liren had already been wary of the vertical eye on Huo Yuhao’s head, hence he had been preparing to defend himself against it this entire time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body transformed into gray mist as these three beams appeared, as he released his martial soul true body yet again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he didn’t understand Huo Yuhao’s abilities at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His transformation into mist could weaken normal attacks against him greatly, but Huo Yuhao’s three beams of light weren’t normal attacks at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhong Liren’s mist was formidable, but it defended against physical attacks in the end, and could partially protect him against soul power attacks at most. However, there was no way he could defend himself against spiritual attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Light of Destiny was the first to reach him, and it instantly tainted his gray mist golden. His martial soul true body froze in an instant. He didn’t feel like he was hit at all, but an intense insecurity and uneasiness surfaced in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two streaks of Spiritual Shock came immediately afterwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was his strongest ability. His martial soul was fused with Wang Qiu’er’s at this moment, and this spiritual power amplification caused his spiritual power to rise by yet another level. Those two purplish-golden beams of light were almost material.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhong Liren was momentarily dazed when he was struck by the Light of Destiny, and his descent into bad fortune immediately took effect. He felt as if two tremendous hammers had crashed against the deepest parts of his spirit while he was in his weakest state. He released a stifled grunt, and was directly knocked out of his martial soul true body form. He changed back into human form and plummeted onto the ground as his mind became temporarily empty and blank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhong Liren’s spirit had sustained an acute shock, and this meant his control over his beast souls was hindered. The beast souls lunging towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er became disorganized and chaotic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was clear that this was a fight to the death, so he didn’t hold back at all. The vertical eye on his forehead flickered with brilliant light before the light receded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beast souls that were in front of them interacted with this light when it appeared, and every single one was dispelled. The aura was so brilliant that everything else around it dimmed for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a spectacular sight. Intense golden lights were surrounded and orbited by specks of purple-colored starlight, and only flashed once before Zhong Liren howled agonizingly. He was an eight-rined Soul Douluo, and he had already suffered a shock before this; he arched his head backwards and placed his hands on his skull in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, Huo Yuhao had connected a second Spiritual Shock to his first one. However, this was different from the first, as his second strike came from his Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was amplified by his martial soul fusion with Wang Qiu’er, and Huo Yuhao had explosively unleashed his overloaded spiritual power. The Eye of Destiny closed by itself after this hit, while Huo Yuhao’s face turned ghastly pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had used Spiritual Shock two times in a row and at such intensity, it caused an acute negative backlash to his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, reality proved that his method was effective. Zhong Liren took the second hit from Spiritual Shock, and he could no longer control his beast souls. The swarming beast souls immediately became disorganized and aimless as they scattered in all directions, alleviating much of the pressure on Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon Spear swung out and glowed with endless golden light as every single beast soul was forced back. Her Golden Dragon Spear released a spear light that was almost a meter long because of the martial soul fusion, and there was a feeling like she represented a force of justice so strong that no unholy beings dared to come near. The Ghostshadow Leopard Emperor ambushed her from the darkness, but even it was repelled, and the two of them only took several steps back this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao unleashed his Empress’ Sword. He supported Wang Qiu’er’s efforts with streak after streak of sword light, and he began to chant a curse that was impossible to discern before peculiar spiritual undulations began to ripple from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er continued slashing around with her Golden Dragon Spear as she turned around towards him. Her eyes were filled with astonishment – she could clearly feel that Huo Yuhao’s spiritual undulations were extremely sinister, and so strong that they seemed to resonate with her very soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark blue light receded, and Huo Yuhao’s Empress’ Sword vanished at the same time, while his eyes were replaced with a dash of gray. It was a color filled with barrenness and emptiness, but this grayness only flashed once and disappeared before his eyes sparkled and turned white. This was a hue that was charged with a saintly aura, and his incantations became hastier and more hurried. The beast souls that were already disorganized in the sky gradually slowed down as they heard this chant, and every single one turned their eyes toward him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The beast souls’ eyes no longer seemed hysterical or violent. Instead, their eyes were filled with an indescribable delight, and this included even that Ghostshadow Leopard Emperor, which slowed down and no longer attacked. It was different from the other beast souls, as the Leopard Emperor still retained some of its original willpower, and its eyes sparkled with uncertainty and doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er didn’t know what Huo Yuhao was doing, but he could tell that this was advantageous for them. Right at this moment, Zhong Liren recovered on the other side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two Spiritual Shocks, one after another, and the bad luck that plagued his body affected him severely, and blood was pourng from his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. Wounds on a spiritual level were much more frightening than physical wounds, and Zhong Liren had never expected a youngster like Huo Yuhao to possess such incredible power. He had been wary and vigilant, but he was still struck anyway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had recovered by now, and he immediately felt something was wrong. He glanced at Huo Yuhao while his body glowed with a grey layer of light. This was a type of spiritual protection barrier, and it was typically used when capturing beast souls to prevent a backlash, but he still activated it at this moment.</span></p>
