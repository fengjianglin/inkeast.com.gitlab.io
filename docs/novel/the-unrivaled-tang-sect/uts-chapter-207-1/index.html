Elder Long is on the same level as teacher was, and possesses the Darkness Dragon. His title is the Dragon Emperor. He is possibly the last remaining top-ranked soul master who has contributed greatly to society.” Yan Shaozhe was anxious as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Junior? Are you Mu En’s disciple too?” Long Xiaoyao didn’t react to Huo Yuhao’s cursing. On the contrary, he was surprised by his identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao straightened his chest and said, “That’s right. I am teacher’s closed-door disciple. You’re at least two hundred years older than me. But if you were the same age as me, you wouldn’t be my match, and if teacher were still alive, I don’t think you’d be daring enough to attack anyone from Shrek Academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t being impulsive. He could tell that this Dragon Emperor Douluo wasn’t willing to attack both of them. Yan Shaozhe was a Transcendent Douluo. If Long Xiaoyao didn’t care and attacked him, it was still acceptable. But what about Huo Yuhao? He wasn’t even twenty years old, while Long Xiaoyao was an Ultimate Douluo that had lived for more than two hundred years. Would he really directly attack him? In addition, he was also an old friend of Elder Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why Huo Yuhao exploited the opportunity as Long Xiaoyao attacked to reveal himself. He roared furiously and blocked in front of Yan Shaozhe with his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao squinted his eyes and focused his attention on Huo Yuhao’s vertical eye, “Third eye. A very special martial soul and feeling. You claim that I’m bullying the weak. Fine. What if you attack me then? I’ll only use Rank 50 soul power just like you. If you can make me move even slightly from where I’m standing, I’ll take it as your win. I won’t demand that ring on your finger either. I didn’t expect Mu En to accept another disciple just before he passed away. I’m curious as to what he saw in you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao twisted his head to look at Yan Shaozhe. Yan Shaozhe hadn’t expected anything like this either. He thought of something, and he nodded to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was evidently better for Huo Yuhao to fight instead of him. With the Dragon Emperor Douluo’s identity, there was no way he would harm someone so much younger than him. Even if he lost, he just had to surrender the materials they had extorted from Jing Hongchen. Furthermore, he believed that Huo Yuhao was the best at creating miracles. He had twin martial souls and an Ultimate Martial Soul. If the Dragon Emperor Douluo used the same rank of soul power, he might actually have a chance…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At least this also gave them an opportunity to delay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why did they depart later? Not only was he trying to widen their gap with the other students, but they were also waiting for reinforcements! When Huo Yuhao mentioned that they might be ambushed, he had already let out a secret signal. Reinforcements were likely to be on their way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pointed to the ground and said, “Let’s fight down there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao was amused, and started laughing. “I forgot. You can’t fly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go down then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe was slightly worried as he saw black fog surging not far from where they were. Although he trusted Xian Lin’er, it was possible that the other party had invited another Titled Douluo, since they could even snag the help of Long Xiaoyao. If there was another Titled Douluo, Xian Lin’er would be in trouble. After hearing Long Xiaoyao, it was evident that he had no intention of letting her off!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was smart, and could tell Yan Shaozhe’s intention from his eyes. He thought of something and said, “Elder Long, let’s make a bet. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao chortled and said, “Bet? To me, that’s a rather new word. Tell me about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “I believe that the fight between Dean Xian Lin’er and the Scorpion Tiger Douluo should be at a stalemate now. Right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao nodded and replied, You’re right. In that duel, it’s highly likely that they will both end up critically injured.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “You can also tell that I’m only Rank 50, just a five-ringed Soul King. What do you think will happen if I join in their fight?<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">”</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao laughed, “Little fellow, you’re really confident! Do you really think that you can participate in a fight between Transcendent Douluo?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed too, but his laughter was a little sly. This piqued Long Xiaoyao’s interest further. “This is what I want to bet with you. I’m confident that I can help Dean Xian win this fight in less than a minute after I join it. Do you dare to bet with me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Long Xiaoyao’s expression finally changed, and he took a serious look at Huo Yuhao. He said, “Little fellow, you’re betting with your life here. I can’t see how you have any chance of winning. Furthermore, you can’t play any tricks in front of me. You can’t even depend on Yan Shaozhe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said arrogantly, “I’m using my own strength. I don’t need anybody’s help. Do you dare to bet with me? I don’t have any outrageous requests. Just if I win, please ensure that the three of us can return to the academy safely. Of course, our previous arrangement won’t change. If I can’t force you to move within three strikes, I’ll return the ring to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao smiled and said, “Little fellow, you’re kidnapping me! However, how can I not follow along with you even though I know you’re setting a trap for me? I haven’t seen something so interesting in years. Alright, let me see how you can end their fight in less than a minute.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, the Dragon Emperor Douluo leaped up, and appeared thousands of meters away. At his level of cultivation, he was no different from a god. He could control space and his soul power at will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao.” Yan Shaozhe said softly, “Do you have confidence?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe didn’t say anything more. If it were any other student, Yan Shaozhe would have thought that they were too conceited. However, Huo Yuhao was different. He had created too many miracles. Before he’d even obtained three rings, he had managed to turn the tables in the Elite Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament. His abilities were very strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flying-type soul tool behind his back flashed brightly and dragged his body into the air under his immaculate control. He started to make deep, chanting noises. They were noises that followed a special frequency and rhythm. Both Yan Shaozhe and Long Xiaoyao couldn’t understand what he was chanting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dim white light started to shine in Huo Yuhao’s eyes, and when his eyes turned completely white, the sky turned bright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sun had looked very dim as it was covered by the Scorpion Tiger Douluo’s gloomy clouds. However, it now became more and more intense under Huo Yuhao’s incantations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe felt it the most since he was the closest to Huo Yuhao. He could sense a magical, attractive force coming from his body. It was drawing the light element in the air to his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe was also of the light-type and was from the same origin as Elder Mu’s lineage. Although he wasn’t a Radiant Holy Dragon, instead a Radiant Phoenix, his sensation towards the light element was still very strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the light elements gathered around Huo Yuhao’s body, they formed a strange resonation and started transforming. Amidst the deep chanting, these white lights started to turn into a different kind of element that even Yan Shaozhe was unable to discern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He lifted his right hand, and his body started to light up. The Eye of Destiny also turned white, and an illusory light projection was formed by the white lights behind his back. It was Electrolux!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Teacher, it’s great to see you again.</span></p>

The sun seemed to have heard his call. A strong ray of white light descended from the sky and landed on his body. Electrolux’s figure fused into his body, and the white light was deflected toward the soul beasts in the distance.</span></p>

It was as if countless soul beasts were being massacred, and screams reverberated through the air.</span></p>

He felt a clear tremor in his heart. The soul beasts that he’d taken so much effort to gather instantly broke free from his control and fled in all directions.</span></p>

Xian Lin’er let out a sonorous dragon roar. She stepped on the green dragon and pointed her pike forward. It instantly changed into a green bolt of lightning that struck towards Zhang Peng.</span></p>

He didn’t panic even in such a situation. As his figure quickly retreated, his ninth soul ring flashed. His Scorpion Tiger True Body started to expand, then changed into countless black figures that flew around. At least a third of these black figures were vaporized when the green bolt of lightning passed by them. When Zhang Peng appeared again, he was already a thousand meters away. His face was pale. As he groaned, he spat out fresh blood.</span></p>

Rather, he turned towards the source of that terrifying aura. He saw the white light around Huo Yuhao dissipating, as Huo Yuhao returned to Yan Shaozhe’s side.</span></p>
