 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Plop!” At this point, the sound of water splashing rang out. He Caitou was too nervous, and tore his water lily. Fortunately, his reflexes were quick. He gathered his soul power instantly and pressed down with both his hands. With the powers of the Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, he exerted a force and managed to propel himself into the air just before he fell into the water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t make a move. A huge cauldron suddenly appeared beside He Caitou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao was a little anxious as she said, “Come up.” Once someone dropped into the water, he or she would be eliminated! At this point, she didn’t bother with being embarrassed anymore. As lights flashed again, she had brought her cauldron in front of He Caitou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou pressed his hands lightly against the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron. He lifted himself up and landed on the cauldron. As he was too agitated, his lips were actually trembling slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Xiao…” He Caitou blurted out softly.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll treat you well.”</span></p>

She lowered her head and did not dare to look at him. After two and a half years of separation, they were finally standing together. Their passionate hearts were getting closer and closer to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan touched Bei Bei, “You can do it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Bei Bei had fully regained control of his emotions. As he looked at Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan, as well as He Caitou and Xiao Xiao, he was delighted that they had all found their true loves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Fate of Three Lifetimes on the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron! Caitou, you must grab your opportunity well!” Bei Bei’s called out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou shouted, “Eldest senior, I’ll grab hold of this opportunity! No one else will choose me! Seniors and juniors, don’t choose me anymore! I already have a date!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha…” He Caitou’s confession attracted a lot of laughter, and the atmosphere became much more relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao was still shy. As she reached her hand out, she slapped He Caitou’s neck and said softly, “You’re like black charcoal. Who else is as stupid as me to choose you? You’re too full of yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou chortled, “It’s not painful. Slap me again, I’m scared that I’m dreaming!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao didn’t slap him, but instead lightly caressed the spot she had just slapped. She said softly, “Aren’t you willing to see me in your dream?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou touched his bald head, “I’m willing, of course I’m willing! However, what do I do when I wake up if this is a dream?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao finally smiled. “If this is a dream, you can sit down then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fourth segment was still ongoing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another lady appeared. This lady wore a hat and veil just like the number two student in front of Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she appeared, she waved her right hand, and a streak of light appeared above the water’s surface. Huo Yuhao’s eyes were very sharp, and he was stunned to realize that it was a shuttle-type soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That female student drifted onto the soul tool and stood on it steadily. Her figure glided slowly towards the male students.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she glided, she also removed her hat and revealed her charming looks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This lady looked like she was seventeen or eighteen years old. Not only was she very pretty, but her figure was also very proportionate. She revealed an apologetic look on her face and said, “My name is Ning Tian. As I’m an auxiliary-type soul master, I can only use the strength of my soul tool to keep my balance on the water. I am Rank 54, an auxiliary-type Soul King. My martial soul is the Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she was hinting that she had no strength to float above the water’s surface, no one thought that her abilities were weak. There weren’t any weaklings in the inner courtyard. Furthermore, she also looked very young. When she mentioned her martial soul, the men were enlightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The number one auxiliary-type martial soul on the continent, the Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda! Of course she was qualified to enter the inner courtyard. Even though she had no fighting abilities, she was definitely one of the strongest auxiliary-type soul masters around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was also enlightened. No wonder she had looked so familiar at first sight. She was actually Ning Tian. After so many years, Ning Tian’s figure and looks had developed so drastically that he hadn’t recognized her. Compared to before, she felt much simpler now. There was also a refined aura about her within the simplicity, which made others feel good about her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As an auxiliary-type soul master, I need someone strong to protect me. That’s why I’m choosing someone who can protect me. I believe I can help him reach the peak of the continent.” She wore a smile on her face as she spoke, and glided up before the male students.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one doubted her words. There were many willing participants in the inner courtyard who wanted to protect her! With the aid of the Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda, their abilities were bound to rise at least by forty percent. Once her Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda rose to become a Nine Treasures Glazed Pagoda, she would have the power to change the outcome of a battle single-handedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the young men started to heat up. Even Dai Huabin’s gaze flashed a little as he heard her words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the female students of the same grade, Ning Tian was the only one who could attract him. She was even more attractive than Zhu Lu. However, he possessed a martial soul fusion skill with Zhu Lu, and they were very close. He couldn’t choose his wife, and he hadn’t come here today to find a girlfriend. However, he was tempted as he looked at Ning Tian gliding over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ning Tian went straight for her target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was still thinking about his impression of Ning Tian from before. However, his eyes very quickly widened. That was because he discovered that she was approaching him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Surely not? Surely…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he even finished thinking those words, she was already close in front of him. She nodded towards him slightly, as if she didn’t see the number two female student that was already in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In my eyes, you’re the person who can protect me. I’m willing to follow you with the Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda. Can you give me a piece of ice?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was in shock as their eyes met. Ning Tian was a little shy, but the look in her eyes was very resolute. Yes, Huo Yuhao was her choice, not because she liked him, but because he was strong enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she possessed the Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda, Ning Tian was nurtured as the heir to the sect master since childhood. She was outstanding in all aspects. However, she knew that she needed a strong protector before she could reach the peak of this world, even though she had the strongest auxiliary-type martial soul. Choosing her partner was also the best chance for her to pick this protector. She only had one shot at this, and thus she needed to choose the best person that she could recognize.</span></p>

He was already a Soul King. Although his rank wasn’t very high, he had twin martial souls! Furthermore, Ning Tian also knew that he didn’t just possess twin martial souls, he even possessed the Ultimate Ice. He also had the Snow Lady, and was even a Class 6 soul engineer. Most inner courtyard students weren’t too interested in soul tools. However, Ning Tian had a different perspective. Since she had no fighting abilities, she could use soul tools to attack. Due to her understanding of soul tools, she understood that a Class 6 soul engineer was very strong.</span></p>

As for feelings, she believed that they could be nurtured. She was also confident of attracting Huo Yuhao with her talents. Being very self-confident, she still chose Huo Yuhao even though the number two female student had already approached him earlier.</span></p>

After doing this, she even clapped her hands. She started to giggle. She gave off the feeling that everything was fine.</span></p>

She descended onto the patch of ice.</span></p>

As she lifted her right hand, a streak of bright light appeared in her palm. A seven-story pagoda flashing with dazzling lights appeared on her palm. As her soul rings drifted up, they eventually surrounded the pagoda. Under the illumination of her soul rings, the pagoda became brighter and brighter.</span></p>

Strength, speed, soul, defense, attack.”</span></p>

The pagoda flew up and expanded, as her five soul rings shone in succession. Five streaks of rainbow light were also released, and landed on Huo Yuhao’s body, engulfing him. In the dark night, he was covered by a rich array of colors.&nbsp;</span></p>

It wasn’t just his cultivation; his strength, speed, soul power, and other aspects were enhanced as well! &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
