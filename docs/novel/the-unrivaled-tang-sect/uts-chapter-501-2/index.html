 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned his palm around and took a detailed look at the dark-blue powder. At the same time, he unleashed his spiritual power to boost his olfactory sense and vision, in a bid to recognize what this poison was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He still held some hope in his heart. Given the large number of treasures that he had obtained from the Icefire Yin Yang Well, they should be sufficient if they could expel the poison in Tang Ya’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But very soon, he was disappointed. After a brief moment, he lifted his head to look at Bei Bei. He shook his head gently and said, “Eldest senior, there’s no other way. I’ve already felt it clearly. This evil poison is very complex. It’s a kind of lethal poison made from a mix of other poisons, formed by mixing many other lethal poisons. As it has fused with Teacher Xiao Ya’s life energy, its components can’t be independently identified. Furthermore, there are also strong spiritual undulations coming from this evil poison. They should belong to the person who injected this poison into Teacher Xiao Ya’s body. I have no way of separating her life energy from the poison or identifying its components.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded lightly and replied, “I understand. Yuhao, you’ve done your best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. But don’t worry, eldest senior, I’ve some confidence in keeping her alive. Given her current condition, if she continues getting poisoned, I’m afraid that the poison would completely take over her entire body within half a year’s time. When that happens, her spirit will be devoured by the evil poison. There wouldn’t be any way of waking her up then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right now, detoxifying her requires half a year. This means that she won’t die within the next half a year during the cleansing process. However, her life energy will keep on dissipating. The more conscious she is, the weaker she’ll become. When her memories finally return, that will be the time when her life energy is almost drained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, I have the Life Guardian Blade. From now on, she can carry it with her wherever she goes. Her life energy will be continually replenished from the life aura of the blade. In this way, she’ll be able to survive for a year, at the very least. This gives us enough time to locate the Bluesilver Emperor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his words, Bei Bei was delighted. “That’ll be great! Thanks, Yuhao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “There’s no need to thank me for anything. This is the least I can do. I also hope that Teacher Xiao Ya can recover!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi asked from one side, “Yuhao, if the life energy from your Life Guardian Blade is so strong, can’t it help her recover? Can’t her life energy be completely replenished by it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “It might be a possibility if it were someone else. However, it won’t do in her situation. Her life origin is also being taken apart as her life energy dissipates. The same goes for her martial soul. This also means that her life energy is like water, and her body is like a container. Only sufficient water can sustain her. However, the container is now broken. No matter how much water you pour in, the water will still flow out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We can say that water is constantly flowing into the container, which stops it from becoming completely empty at a slower rate. She can live longer. However, the container can only be repaired if we find the Bluesilver Emperor. If we can, her life energy will solidify on its own, and she’ll recover even if there’s no replenishment from elsewhere.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi was enlightened. “So that’s the case. It’s actually so confusing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said, “Alright, Yuhao, you can begin now. No matter what happens in the end, we’ve already done our best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Yes. Eldest senior, hug Teacher Xiao Ya tightly. She’ll be in real pain later. However, this first step is very crucial. At least it can guarantee that her body won’t continue to be damaged by the evil poison.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Bei Bei hugged Tang Ya tightly. Right now, he was as pale as she was. He had never been so tense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao brought the pill in front of Tang Ya. This pill contained the essence of the Delicate Silk Immortal’s years of cultivation. It was even more effective in detoxification than the Delicate Silk Immortal herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gentle pink light surged into Tang Ya’s body under the guidance of Huo Yuhao’s soul power. She shuddered as those purplish-black patterns appeared on her skin once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pinkish glow from the Delicate Silk Immortal Pill touched the dark-blue. Tang Ya’s body started to ripple. The purplish-black patterns seemed to be pulled apart by the pinkish light as it rippled on Tang Ya’s skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her body started shaking hard. Dark-blue beads of sweat instantly surfaced on her forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao depressed his palm slightly as he held the pill with his other hand. The diamond ice crystals of his Ice Empress’ Pincer engulfed his palm. He used the Tang Sect’s Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon to suck the beads of perspiration on Tang Ya’s forehead that contained poison into his palm. When the beads touched Huo Yuhao’s Ice Empress’ Pincer, they quickly froze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slowly, a dark-blue ice crystal appeared on Huo Yuhao’s palm as dark-blue beads of sweat kept flying out from Tang Ya’s body. The beads even flew out from her shirt into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song waved her hand and said, “Girls can remain. Guys, go to one side and cultivate. Don’t stay here to watch.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi and the rest immediately revealed a weird expression on their faces. However, they still turned around and walked to one side to cultivate. Only Xiao Xiao, Jiang Nannan, Ye Guyi, and Nan Qiuqiu remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song was afraid that Tang Ya’s clothes would be torn during this treatment process. Huo Yuhao was trying to treat her, and thus he had no choice but to remain. However, the rest of the guys had to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya’s body shook even harder. However, her life aura was getting weaker and weaker.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny opened. A beam of gentle spiritual power engulfed Tang Ya’s forehead, helping to stabilize her spiritual sea. At the same time, a streak of jade-green lightning shot out and drifted above her forehead. After this, the streak of lightning slowly landed and stuck to her chest. It was the Life Guardian Blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment the Life Guardian Blade appeared, the air was filled with a strong aura of life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes flashed, and a distorted projection formed beside his body. It actually became another him. This distorted projection appeared a little illusory, but it soon became more real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song was secretly shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Concrete-material spiritual power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Huo Yuhao that was slowly taking form silently walked forward and came to Tang Ya’s side. He summoned his spiritual power and poured it into the Life Guardian Blade. He directed the life energy in the Life Guardian Blade to flow into Tang Ya’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only at this moment that a slight pinkish glow returned to Tang Ya’s face. Although her life energy was still dissipating, the life energy that was being poured into her body was much stronger. At least, it was capable of maintaining her own energy level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei still looked as pale as ever, now able to fully sense what Huo Yuhao was talking about earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the immense life energy from the Life Guardian Blade flowed into Tang Ya’s body, it would slowly seep out from the pores over her entire body and enter his. It made Bei Bei feel like his body was being nourished instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this were his normal cultivation time, Bei Bei would definitely be happy with such a situation. An increase in his soul power would mean a strengthening of any soul master’s body. It was very beneficial to his future cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, how could Bei Bei be happy with the current situation he was in? Life energy was seeping out from Tang Ya’s body. This meant that she wasn’t absorbing anything!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed, second by second. The dark-blue poisonous ice crystal in Huo Yuhao’s hand was already as large as his palm. The beads coming from Tang Ya’s body started to fade in color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya’s body finally calmed down under the effect of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power and the life energy of the Life Guardian Blade. She slowly fell into a deep sleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the poisonous ice crystals expanded another round, Huo Yuhao retracted the immortal pill. At the same time, he put the block of ice crystals into his storage-type soul tool. Under the extremely low temperature of his Ultimate Ice, it wouldn’t be able to cause any further trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao also heaved a sigh of relief. He stood up, but his spiritual entity was still controlling the output of life energy into Tang Ya’s body to maintain the life energy inside her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although this couldn’t strengthen her life energy, one’s bodily functions would recover at a faster speed if one had sufficient life energy, so his efforts weren’t for nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was anxious as he looked at Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao nodded at him. “Eldest senior, don’t worry. Teacher Xiao Ya’s condition is still quite stable. After this round of detoxification, the poison on the surface has all been sucked out. She won’t be corroded any further, but this will make her weaker. You’ll still need to take care of her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei asked, “Will she regain her awareness when she wakes up?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly and said, “I’m afraid it’s going to be difficult. I’m not sure what will really happen. However, the evil poison has invaded her body for too long. Her spiritual sea has been seriously affected. She’ll need time even if she recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
