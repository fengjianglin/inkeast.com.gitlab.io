Although that worm has a greater cultivation than you, he can’t compare to you in terms of his spiritual sense. Your spiritual sense is also very pure, which is a very rare thing. No wonder you’re the Icesky Snow Lady.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress was aloof as she looked back at Electrolux, “Human, you don’t have to say such useless things to me. You’re very powerful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux smiled, and the wrinkles on his face became very obvious. “You can sense my power because you’re on a different level. Although I was only left with a shred of my divine sense when I came to this world, it still exists. Although your level isn’t low, it has remained stagnant at that level. After all, one’s spiritual and divine sense don’t belong in the same category.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress’ spirit jerked a little. “Are you the split consciousness of a god?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux shook his head and said, “No, I’m just a human who didn’t want to be a god. In my previous world, becoming a god signified eternal death. It seems to be different in this world. It’s a pity that I no longer possess the foundation to become a god.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s talk about your matter. Your situation is actually very simple. After you lost your body, your immense spiritual sense no longer has a body to house it. Your spiritual power can no longer contain your origin power, and it’ll eventually blow apart. There doesn’t seem to be a place in Yuhao’s body that can contain you, because he is still not strong enough right now. While it isn’t possible to contain you now, that doesn’t mean that it will be impossible in the future. That’s why I’m willing to help you. I’m also helping myself, the worm, and the scorpion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With your strength, it’ll be much easier for Yuhao to advance in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress replied, “If I’m going to live, I’d rather return to nature than live so pathetically.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux smiled. “No one’s asking you to live pathetically. I’ve already thought about your future. But the time isn’t ripe. You need to preserve your powers and prevent them from dissipating. Your intelligence will exist with your spiritual sense.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My future?” The Snow Empress was a little confused, and looked at Electrolux with a new sense of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux nodded, and his lips moved as if he were saying something, but Skydream, the Ice Empress, and Huo Yuhao couldn’t hear him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress listened very carefully. After a long while, her confusion turned into shock. “Is that really possible?” she asked, and everyone could hear her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux answered in a deep voice. “I never exaggerate things. I’m seventy percent confident that it can be realized. Furthermore, it’s only your origin power that will need to be sealed. Your spiritual sense and intelligence can remain in Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Sea just like the worm and the scorpion, which will allow you to consolidate your spiritual sense and help you familiarize yourself with this place. When Yuhao’s cultivation reaches seven rings, it’ll be a great opportunity to evolve.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Snow Lady, I beg you. Please stay here.” The Ice Empress pestered the Snow Empress, and used her long scorpion tail to caress the Snow Empress’ slender thigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right. Stay here.” The Skydream Iceworm followed her to the Snow Empress’ side. However, he was smacked by the Ice Empress’ pincer before he could get close to the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress turned to Huo Yuhao, and her icy-blue eyes bore a complicated look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Huo Yuhao knew what he should do. He stared at the Snow Empress with a sincere look on his face and said, “Greetings, Snow Empress! Although I don’t know what Elder Yi said to you, I really hope that you can stay. I can’t guarantee that I’ll fulfill your wish in the future, but I’ll do my best to. You’re the darling of nature, you can’t just die. I’ll treat you like a friend, partner, and even kin, just like how I treat Skydream and the Ice Empress.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Snow Empress stayed, it would be very beneficial to him. Although Huo Yuhao didn’t know what Elder Yi said to the Snow Empress, he had clearly heard the word ‘evolve’. Furthermore, his control over his body would become stronger as his abilities increased. Even the powerful spirits that existed in his body couldn’t forcefully control his body anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the Snow Empress had turned into a human embryo, she had nearly seven hundred thousand years of cultivation! Even though she had blown her own body apart, her main strength was sealed within her origin. It would certainly be very useful for him in the future. In addition, the Snow Empress and Ice Empress appeared to very close, the Ice Empress would be delighted if the Snow Empress stayed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her desire to survive eventually trumped her pride. The Snow Empress glanced at the Ice Empress’ hopeful eyes and nodded, albeit with a little hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress quickly changed the topic. “Snow Lady, how did you manage to do it? With your seven-hundred thousand years of cultivation, you can’t possibly be reborn as a human! Above a hundred-thousand years of cultivation, our strength can’t be restricted just by sealing it. Even if we’re willing to give up our strength, we won’t be able to do it! How did you succeed?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress said, “I encountered a hundred-thousand year Snow Lotus. The Snow Lotus can’t unlock one’s spiritual intelligence, but it contains the purest essence of heaven and earth. I used it to seal my origin, which allowed me to be reborn as a human. But who knew that I would be so unfortunate as to meet a human that had snuck into the Extreme North? He exploited the opportunity to seal me in that vicious Godsealing Altar.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress was enlightened. “I see. No wonder you chose this path. It’s a pity…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux spoke in a deep voice. “Snow Lady, your spiritual sense is too unstable because your sealed origin power is too immense. We must begin quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Snow Empress was very proud, she wouldn’t delay after she made her choice. She nodded and answered, “I’ll have to trouble you, then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux drifted to the Snow Empress and reached his right hand forward. The Spiritual Sea beside them started to surge as Huo Yuhao entered a trance. Countless golden spots formed a light that was as bright as the stars, gathering towards Electrolux.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A long, golden staff slowly took form. Huo Yuhao felt a sudden and intense weakness as it condensed in Electrolux’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux was in a different situation than the Skydream Iceworm and Ice Empress. When he fused into Huo Yuhao’s body, he was only left with a shred of his divine sense. He needed to rely on Huo Yuhao’s strength every time he wanted to exhibit any form of ability. Under such circumstances, the power that he wanted to use must be within Huo Yuhao’s ability to handle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The formation of this staff had undoubtedly drained Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux’s aura changed when the golden staff entered his hands. An indescribable sense of purity and elegance made him seem like a god that had descended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A deep chant sounded out, Electrolux was reciting mystical words. At the start, his voice was very deep. However, it gradually started to echo in Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His mighty voice made him appear even more majestic. Skydream and the Ice Empress didn’t move from where they were. The Snow Empress had already shut her eyes, and appeared to be sensing something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was the only one in pain. He felt weaker and weaker. To his horror, he discovered that his boundless Spiritual Sea was shrinking at an alarming rate. His spiritual power was also decreasing significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He initially felt that he already overestimated Elder Yi. But now he realized that Elder Yi was far stronger than he had thought. Huo Yuhao made such this judgment after witnessing the Ice Empress, Snow Empress, and Skydream Iceworm’s reactions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress’ pride quickly disappeared as Elder Yi recited his incantations. What replaced it was a sense of solemnity and esteem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How powerful would Elder Yi be if he wasn’t just a shred of divine sense? Perhaps even a Transcendent Douluo would be inferior to him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s belief grew despite the weakness he felt. He had realized how small he was during the fight between Illustrious Virtue Hall and the Body Sect. He wasn’t at a level where he could get involved in such an intense fight. He couldn’t even use his Spiritual Detection in such circumstances.</span></p>

However, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Sea started to shake as Elder Yi continued to chat. In his Spiritual Sea, both bright and dim rays of light intersected. Huo Yuhao fell to a half-conscious state from the drain on his spiritual strength.</span></p>

A golden beam of light turned into a strong ray shining directly on Huo Yuhao’s body. He was jolted awake by the strong light.</span></p>

Strange runes slowly formed on the sphere. Every time a mysterious rune was formed, it would detach from the globe, drift towards the Snow Empress, and imprint onto her forehead. While the rune slowly fused into the Snow Empress’ forehead, a second rune would slowly take form before drifting towards her again. This process carried on very smoothly.</span></p>
