As Chu Qingtian saw the tears flowing down her cheeks, he felt greatly moved. He suddenly saw that she wasn’t as scary as he had thought. The slight resistance he had had in his heart disappeared quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan sighed. In fact, everyone could tell that Chu Qingtian’s words lacked sincerity even though they sounded flawless. But how could she reject Wu Ming, especially with those tears streaming down her face?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ming’er, you should know that the rules can’t be broken. If I make this an exception for you, it won’t be fair for everyone else. However, we know that there’s always a single exception made in the Sea God’s Fate. If everyone is willing to let you use this exception, then I think we can do it if everyone is moved by your feelings. However, I can let you make a new choice if someone proposes otherwise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, eldest senior sister.” Wu Ming’s voice suddenly turned excited, and she thanked Zhang Lexuan. After that, she turned her attention to all the female students and said, “Today, I hope to leave with Chu Qingtian. I’m a direct person, so I won’t say anything else. I hope that all of you will give me this chance. I’ll remember this favor. If there’s anything you need, just tell me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Bei Bei looked at Wu Ming, he muttered, “Sister Wu Ming is so steady! If she were a guy, she’d be really impressive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan glanced at him and said, “Stop with the sarcasm. Do you really think Wu Ming can’t hear the insincerity in Chu Qingtian’s words? Don’t judge her by her fierce appearance. In fact, very few know about her equally fierce intelligence. She doesn’t want to be hurt again, and wants to fight for another chance for herself. That’s why she didn’t expose him. Let’s see what Chu Qingtian’s going to do. If he brings Ming’er back today and hurts her in the future, I won’t let him go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei turned fearful. In that instant, he clearly felt the seriousness in her words, and didn’t even dare to look at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eldest senior sister, you should also find a guy.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei shut his mouth immediately and lowered his head. He even looked quite guilty. “Sister, I’m sorry…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan said, “It was my choice. What has it got to do with you? Since I made that choice years ago, I won’t change it. Alright, let’s get back to official business.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one doubted Wu Ming’s words. Whether it was because the male students were scared of her, or the female students shared a good relationship with her or wanted her to owe them a favor, they granted her the perfect ending she always wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. Since there are no objections, we shall grant this exception to Chu Qingtian.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, eldest senior sister.” Chu Qingtian was drenched as he leapt up from the water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Ming gestured towards him, and he landed on the water lily. The water lily had a diameter of one meter, and thus it was fine for two people to stand on it together. It was just that they would have to stand rather close to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Qingtian smelled a refreshing scent as he stood beside Wu Ming. It was the smell of a quilt laying in the sun. It was comfortable, clean and refreshing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Ming took a look at him and said softly, “If you’re lying to me, I’m going to castrate you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Qingtian’s butt clenched, and he shook his head vigorously. “Of course not!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Ming lifted his hand and softly placed it on his back. Suddenly, a warm flow started to engulf his body. His drenched clothing quickly dried up, but he wasn’t burned by the heat. Wu Ming’s control of the Golden Crow Primordial Fire had reached a high level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Ming said softly, “I’ll try to be with gentler with you. Okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Qingtian nodded his head. “Of course.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you think I’m not gentle enough now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uh… this…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll really be gentler with you.” Wu Ming spoke with certainty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan to Hua Yao and Gu Fan to He Caitou and Xiao Xiao to Chu Qingtian and Wu Ming now, there were already a few couples who had established their mutual feelings for each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fourth segment, Destined In Three Lives, continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Wu Ming, it was Han Ruoruo’s turn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Han Ruoruo appeared, she pointed with her toes and glided out in front of the male students. There was a look of hesitation in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My name is Han Ruoruo. I’m sure all of you know about me. I’m older than Wu Ming. I’m probably the oldest student in the inner courtyard. Due to my cultivation, I delayed finding a partner. In fact, I don’t know how to choose one today. To me, fighting has always been easier than finding a guy. That’s why I don’t know how to choose. Eldest senior sister, can I change my form in this segment? If someone likes me, I hope you can stand up and tell me. Otherwise, I’ll leave today’s blind date.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Han Ruoruo called Zhang Lexuan her eldest senior sister, she was older than her. Even Zhang Lexuan didn’t know how to reject her at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, she nodded and said, “Are there any male students who like Ruoruo? If there are, please stand up and fight for your own happiness. No one will laugh at you. They’ll only wish you the best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, Han Ruoruo wasn’t young. There weren’t many male students who were close to her in terms of age. Moreover, everyone knew that Han Ruoruo was an eight-ringed Soul Douluo. In the inner courtyard, there wasn’t anyone whose cultivation was higher than her apart from Zhang Lexuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone felt proud of themselves for becoming a member of the inner courtyard. But it wasn’t a pleasant thing for a guy’s cultivation to be lower than his partner’s. This was also the same problem that Wu Ming faced. That was why it wasn’t easy for them to find a suitable partner. At times, being too outstanding wasn’t exactly a good thing for a woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No male students stepped up. Currently, they had all chosen to remain silent for various reasons. In the end, no one chose Han Ruoruo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She revealed a self-mocking and helpless smile on her face and sighed in her heart. Just as she was about to leave, a voice came from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder if I make the cut?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This voice didn’t come from any of the male students. Instead, it came from the ferry. Following this, a figure leapt out from the ferry. He wasn’t too quick. He had two yellow, two purple and two black soul rings, which rose from his feet. Streaks of flowing light flashed and turned into dim patterns which supported him in the air. He appeared at the crowd of male students as his figure flashed a few times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a middle-aged man who looked like he was forty years old. He had six soul rings, which revealed his cultivation as a Soul Emperor. He was charming, and had a refined demeanor. His deep eyes revealed a wise look. His martial soul was very special. Upon closer examination, people could tell that it was a long stick that emanated the light patterns. There were dragon patterns on it. The Coiled Dragon Stick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao, He Caitou and Bei Bei were the first to be shocked when they saw this man. They recognized him, especially Huo Yuhao. That was because this middle-aged man was once their class teacher, and he was the teacher that had led them to victory in the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament, Wang Yan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they returned from the tournament, he was given the opportunity to carry out martial soul research in the Library of the Sea God’s Pavilion. Huo Yuhao had only seen him very infrequently since then, and hadn’t expected him to show up today.</span></p>

She hadn’t expected that no student would confess to her, but a teacher would.</span></p>

However, he was a teacher! Furthermore, Wang Yan’s cultivation was only at six rings.</span></p>

I know that I’m being a little out of the blue. However, I also know that this is my only chance. I’m not young either—I’m already forty.”</span></p>

I know that my cultivation isn’t high, and I’m not fit to be with you. However, just like Lexuan said, one shouldn’t be embarrassed about fighting for their own happiness. That’s why I’m willing to walk out and confess my admiration for you.”</span></p>

He nodded slightly. “It started about three years ago. I had just brought the team back from the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament. When I encountered problems in my martial soul research, I asked Dean Yan to find a few inner courtyard students to help me with my research. You were one of them. Those two months that we researched soul tools and martial souls together, was probably the time that I was least focused on research in my whole life.”</span></p>

However, I didn’t know if that feeling was love, even though I’m so old.”</span></p>

When you left, I felt that you had taken something from me along with you. It was only later that I realized—it was my heart.”</span></p>
