 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the ice explosions distracting the Princess of the Sea, it would be a while before she could catch up to them. The Snow Empress felt that it was unlikely that the Princess of the Sea would chase after them anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it seemed as though the Snow Empress had underestimated the Princess’ hatred for humans. Just when they had flown out a bit, a gigantic wave was raised again as it pursued them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time around, the Snow Empress was not planning to run away anymore. Huo Yuhao’s dark blue eyes flickered, following which, the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass emerged from his shoulder. The Ice Empress, Little Bai, and the Skydream Iceworm were also released from Huo Yuhao’s body as they floated behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Tang Wutong was silently standing where she was, she could sense clearly the anger boiling within the Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back when the Snow Empress was still in the Extreme North, she was probably of equal status to the Princess of the Sea. In fact, she was more powerful than the Princess of the Sea. However, the Princess did not seem to care about this, nor did she show any respect to the Snow Empress. With the ego and pride the Snow Empress had, how could she let this go so easily?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since you really want to fight, bring it on!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress stared coldly at the Princess and her daughter, who were riding on a tall wave crest. She said coldly, “Princess of the Sea, are you dead set on fighting me to the death today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea returned an equally cold stare. “Snow Empress, I don’t care whether you are real or fake or some sort of Spirit. I just want you to know that my little daughter—who has the royal blood of the Merfolk flowing in her golden veins—is my successor. Now that she is about to die, the entire Merfolk race could go extinct. In that case, do you think I still have anything holding me back? These despicable humans must all die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, she raised her hands as she transformed the ocean around her into water arrows. These arrows went straight for the Spirits, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, who were floating in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh really?” The Snow Empress replied coldly, “Let’s see who will be the one dying today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Icy War God’s Armor radiated a deep blue glow as the water arrows which were rapidly ascending transformed into ice crystals before falling back into the sea. The Ice Empress, who was beside the Snow Empress, pressed her hands down as some of the ice arrows changed direction, and sped downwards instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass released its Star Anise Icy Coagulation as it furiously absorbed the ice-type elemental energy from the air. The air above the Ice Sea was definitely not only the Princess’ home ground. The ice-type Spirits also commanded the same home ground advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Er Bai released a blinding white light from its body as the air around it started to become very volatile and violent. The Ice Bear King’s Blizzard!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point in time, winds and clouds were surging over the backdrop of humongous waves on the surface of the Ice Sea. A huge battle was about to unfold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm had transformed into a golden light before appearing in front of Tang Wutong. Tang Wutong lifted her hand and reached out for the Life Reflection Shield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she held the Life Reflection Shield with her left hand and the Golden Dragon Spear with her right hand, she released a powerful golden aura as she floated in mid-air. She was charging her power for the inevitable blow she would deliver.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She might not be moving now, but once she launched herself into the fight, she would definitely create an incredible impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea and her daughter seemed to have revised their strategy this time around. She sent gigantic water pillars from the Ice Sea into the sky. The pillars were aimed at both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. Even though the Ultimate Ice soul power was able to freeze these pillars, the continuous water flow within them would immediately flush the ice slabs into Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. There was no chance of them landing straight back into the sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In addition, the Princess of the Sea was a powerful soul beast which had cultivated for over six hundred thousand years, and ruled the vast ocean. She had long seen through the fact that the Snow Empress was only relying on the strengths of the humans for this battle. Even though the Snow Empress might be able to put up a fight when it came to soul skills and other fancy abilities, she would not be able to compare with the Princess of the Sea when it came to pure power. Hence, the Princess of the Sea chose the simplest method—to dominate! Even though it would be very taxing on her body, she wanted to dominate Huo Yuhao—who was under the control of the Snow Empress—by defeating him with her larger soul power reserves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On top of that, the Princess of the Sea began her melodic singing as she released rings of blue light into her surroundings. It was impossible to avoid them as they drifted towards Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress and Tang Wutong immediately shut off their sense of hearing. However, the Princess’ voice was also a form of spiritual attack. Hence, it was useless to just shut off one’s sense of hearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Huo Yuhao was still awake, he would definitely know a way to stop it. However, the Snow Empress could only use Huo Yuhao’s body to release her abilities. She was not able to control his spiritual power. If the Skydream Iceworm had not fused completely with Huo Yuhao, she might still be able to control some of his spiritual power. However, after Huo Yuhao had fused the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s Skull of Destiny with his body, she was no longer able to control his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A powerful dizzying sensation started to sweep towards them. The Princess’ spiritual power was simply too strong. Under the suppression of her superior soul power and the constant shockwaves of her spiritual power, the Snow Empress was unable to release her attacking power effectively. The Princess’ power was definitely comparable to that of a human Ultimate Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were unable to perform their martial soul fusion, even with the support of the Spirits, they were fighting a losing battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea stared coldly at her opponents, who were being pushed back by countless blocks of thick ice. She knew that victory was imminent. Even though these humans were extremely powerful—especially when they had the help of the Snow Empress—they would not be able to stand up to her overwhelming power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My dear daughter! Mother will avenge you. If you really die in the future, I will use countless human lives to pray for your soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress gritted her teeth as she tried to fend off the furious attacks which were coming her way. If not for the Icy War God’s Armor, she would have long since crumbled. After all, Huo Yuhao had not even become a Titled Douluo. Even though he already possessed a soul core, it was ultimately still a spiritual-type soul core. Under such circumstances, the soul skills he could execute were very limited. The assistance provided by his Spirits were all built on the foundation of his original soul power. Even though this granted him a boost in power, this boost was ultimately limited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao might be able to put up with the attacks for longer if he was awake and was able to use the Haodong Power with Tang Wutong. However, the Snow Empress was unable to hold off the attacks any longer. The boost provided by the Icy War God’s Armor was still not able to put Huo Yuhao on par with an Ultimate Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What do I do now? Are we really going to perish here? Huo Yuhao had just managed to establish contact with a God. There was a really good chance that he could set us free in the future. How can I just die here like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Booommm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a loud metallic sound could be heard. Following which, a blinding golden light appeared beside Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the golden light appeared, it was actually able to stop the rapidly ascending blocks of ice. No matter how the seawater tried to push it upwards, the thick block of ice just would not budge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone, including the Princess of the Sea, the Snow Empress and the Spirits, were all focused on Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, this overwhelming golden light was coming from Tang Wutong’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Tang Wutong had closed her eyes as a gigantic ball of purple-gold light radiated from her back. This was her eighth soul skill—the Dragon Dance of the Radiant Sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Dance of the Radiant Sun’s huge amount of energy was highly concentrated as it continued to radiate pressure and power to block the Princess’ attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, both the Snow Empress and the Princess of the Sea could tell that Tang Wutong would not be able to maintain the sun for too long. After all, it was ultimately a soul skill, and there was a limit as to how long soul masters could maintain their soul skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea laughed coldly after determining that Tang Wutong’s soul skill was but her final struggle. She continued to inject her spiritual power into her voice as her singing became increasingly melodic. However, she did not activate her stronger soul skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more powerful a soul skill was, the likelier it was to expose the user defensively after execution. Previously, Huo Yuhao was able to neutralize her strongest attack and seal her. This left a deep impression on the Princess of the Sea. Hence, now that she had the upper hand, she was content with maintaining her lead. She was not anxious to win at all, because she knew she could outlast Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao when it came to soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress took in a deep breath as she turned around to look at the Ice Empress. The Ice Empress gave her a gentle nod as she turned around and floated to Huo Yuhao’s side. The image of the Snow Empress emerged from Huo Yuhao’s body and fused instantly with the Ice Empress. A powerful ice jade color light suddenly appeared, and instantly increased in intensity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pride of the Ice and Snow Empresses!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was probably their last chance to fight to the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though they knew how slim their chances were, they knew they had to try in order to even have a chance of surviving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no one would have expected what would happen next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Pride of the Ice and Snow Empresses transformed into a gigantic pillar of light that pushed the thick block of ice in the air towards the Princess of the Sea, Tang Wutong chose to keep her Dragon Dance of the Radiant Sun close to her body instead of assisting the Ice and Snow Empresses with their attacks. It seemed as though she had given up on attacking when the best opportunity had just revealed itself to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The five Spirits were shocked by what she had just done.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What is she thinking?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the protection of the purple golden sun, Tang Wutong, who was floating in mid-air, tapped her forehead with her right hand. Following which, her ninth soul ring lit up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Huo Yuhao had not seen Tang Wutong use her ninth soul skill. They might share an intimate relationship, but he had never asked her about it. After all, soul skills were the biggest secrets for soul masters. If Tang Wutong did not share her ninth soul skill with him, Huo Yuhao would never ask her about it because he respected her decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now, when they were in serious peril, Tang Wutong decided to activate her blood-red ninth soul ring for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the red light continued to expand into its surroundings, the Snow Empress and Ice Empress immediately understood what Tang Wutong was trying to do after seeing how the ninth ring lit up. Tang Wutong did not release the Dragon Dance of the Radiant Sun to attack the Princess of the Sea. She had released it to protect herself as she used the time to execute her ninth soul skill. It was apparent that her ninth soul skill required a long time to charge up before it could be released.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea felt her heart skip a beat as an inexplicable sense of panic hit her. She was shocked by what she was seeing. Immediately, she did not care about wasting soul power anymore as her eyes turned golden. She moved her gigantic fishtail as a golden image appeared behind her back. The image was identical to her.</span></p>
