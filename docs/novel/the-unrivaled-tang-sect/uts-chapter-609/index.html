 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time around, even Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Interference Domain was unable to conceal their aura. The powerful spiritual fluctuations which were released by them could be sensed by every single person within the temporary palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gigantic eye appeared in the air. This eye was golden, but its surroundings shone with a majestic purple-gold light. Its frightening radiance expanded at the next instant as small mystical hammers appeared throughout the entire hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mantra Amidst the Void, Spiritual Tempest! This was one of the four martial soul fusion skills Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong shared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also the most powerful spiritual attack amongst their martial soul fusion skills. They were no longer holding back, as they had to achieve their mission objective as quickly as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, even if Long Xiaoyao and Ye Xishui were to be revived, they would also choose to avoid taking Huo Yuhao and Tang Wuton’s soul skill head-on. Perhaps only the Evileye Tyrant would stand a chance against this spiritual attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, ifs and maybes were meaningless most of the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire dining hall was instantly ravaged and shredded to pieces. Even though this was supposed to be a spiritual attack, it was so powerful that it was able to destroy material objects. The heads of those Class 9 soul engineers who were injured by the Ice Explosion and the Spiritual Blast eventually exploded after the soul tools on their bodies gave way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were not the only victims of the powerful martial soul fusion skill. Xu Tianran’s guards had no chance against the powerful and intense spiritual attack released by Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Spiritual Tempest was simply overwhelmingly frightening. Xu Tianran lost two powerful Class 9 spiritual defensive soul tools throughout the storm. This was sufficient to show how powerful their Spiritual Tempest was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Xu Tianran was starting to lose hope. The throbbing pain within his body made it extremely difficult for him to flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As of now, Tang Wutong was already wielding her Golden Dragon Spear, while Huo Yuhao held his small dagger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao swept his dagger horizontally as a streak of icy blue light appeared before their eyes. The ten meters of space around Xu Tianran were instantly frozen. At that instant, the ambient temperature plunged to a temperature which was close to absolute zero. Xu Tianran mustered the remaining strength in his body to resist the intense cold which was attacking his body. The most frightening thing was how Huo Yuhao had only done this to temporarily immobilize Xu Tianran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that the dining hall had been destroyed by the Spiritual Tempest, the entire area was covered with dust and dirt. When Xu Tianran could finally see what was around him, he realized that the two people before him had transformed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had vanished. Instead, two familiar pairs of eyes were now staring at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were none other than the Death God Douluo, Ye Xishui, and the Dragon Emperor Douluo, Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“B-Both of you…” Xu Tianran was no longer able to make sense of reality. He could no longer be sure if the people who were standing before him were Ye Xishui and Long Xiaoyao or Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he had to make a choice, he would rather believe that the two people were Ye Xishui and Long Xiaoyao. After all, they were Ultimate Douluo! Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were still terribly young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if he were somehow able to survive today’s attack, he would have no chance of conquering the continent if his foes were two Shrek Academy soul masters who possessed Transcendent Douluo abilities. He was already very well aware of how powerful an Ultimate Douluo was after witnessing the powers displayed by the Dragon Emperor Douluo and the Death God Douluo. As long as he or she was careful, an Ultimate Douluo was effectively invincible in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, the hope in his heart did not manage to last very long. Xu Tianran had noticed the eye on “Long Xiaoyao”’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eye was sparkling as a beam of purple-gold light surged out from it and landed on Xu Tianran’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran’s last Class 9 spiritual defensive soul tool finally shattered. At this instant, he felt as though he had become naked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s it. I’m done!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran closed his eyes in pain. He knew that his worries had been legitimate. He was simply too weak when compared to the powerful soul masters of the Douluo Continent. At the end of the day, an Ultimate Douluo possessed enough power to destroy any political power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he had another chance at things again, he would have tried to get Ye Xishui to forgive him at all costs. If Xu Tianran had the Death God Douluo protecting him, there was no way the two of them would be able to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, he was finally certain that the two people before him could not be Ye Xishui and Long Xiaoyao. Both Ultimate Douluo did not possess the Ultimate Ice ability, nor the ability to conceal themselves. Hence, they could only be Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. Even though he did not know when they had become so powerful, he was certain that they were the ones behind his demise. Of course, all of this was no longer important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao unleashed the Merfolk Duet again at this crucial moment. A second streak of purple-gold light landed on Xu Tianran’s body at the very next instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom!” Xu Tianran’s skull exploded as his blood and pieces of his brains splattered across the room. The Emperor of the Sun Moon Empire was dead. In fact, he had died without an intact corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong heaved a sigh of relief after killing Xu Tianran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the entire sequence was within their control, they had actually expended a fair bit of energy and power to achieve this outcome so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before making their move, they had already agreed to focus on spiritual attacks. Hence, Tang Wutong was not required to make too many attacks. Huo Yuhao was the main fighting force throughout the entire battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The results justified their means. Xu Tianran had ultimately died under the power of Huo Yuhao’s Merfolk Duet and Spiritual Blasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Streaks of light started to flicker in the sky. The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion had started to gather towards the dining hall. They were now establishing protective soul barriers as they tried to envelop the entire compound within their shield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao released a long howl as a gigantic black dragon soared into the air and transformed into an image that rammed into the barrier above them. At the same time, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong flickered before they vanished into thin air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though they were only here for a short amount of time, Huo Yuhao was certain that the Sun Moon Empire’s surveillance soul tools must have already captured their appearances. This was enough, as they had created enough opportunities for Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The linked defensive barrier would be a difficult problem to handle even for a powerful soul master. This was especially true when the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion was the one who had established it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, they were now up against two Ultimate Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, when Xu Tianran was trying to contain Ye Xishui, he had used high-energy compression array soul tools. This was because he knew that any linked defensive soul barrier would not be able to contain an Ultimate Douluo—even if it was established by the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was exactly what happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Morning Dew Dagger sliced into the linked defensive soul barrier as he cut a slit in it effortlessly. Tang Wutong raised her fists and made a gaping hole where Huo Yuhao had cut. Both of them darted through the hole and concealed themselves with their Imitation as they disappeared into the night sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All this time, Ju Zi had been waiting in her room anxiously. She could not help but shudder when she heard the loud explosion caused by the Spiritual Tempest. At that moment, she was overwhelmed by two different emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was extremely excited. If Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were to succeed, all her problems would be solved on their own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was also overwhelmed by fear. Right now, she had already given up all hope on Huo Yuhao. She knew that there was no way that he would give up Tang Wutong for her. Now that Huo Yuhao had become so powerful, she could no longer control him. In fact, he was becoming a threat to her rule over the Sun Moon Empire. Nonetheless, she really didn’t want him and Tang Wutong to fail. She could not imagine what would happen to Huo Yuhao if they were to fail. This fear stemmed from a mother’s love for her husband. It was not something which she could control with her rationality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ju Zi!” At this instant, she heard a very familiar voice. The voice woke her up from the possibilities she was running through in her head. She instinctively exclaimed, “Yuhao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to note that there were many servants present in her room at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These servants were all surprised by her sudden exclamation. Ju Zi instantly flashed a cold stare after seeing their reaction. It seemed as though she was about to kill them to shut them up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she heard Huo Yuhao’s voice once again. “The Ju Zi I know would never kill innocent people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi took a deep breath as she tried to calm herself down. This was really not a good time to silence people. She exclaimed, “I want all of you to scram out of this room. If anyone dares to spread any meaningless rumors around the palace, don’t blame me for being ruthless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, Your Majesty.” The servants scrambled out of the room. Ju Zi hastily called out to Huo Yuhao, “Yuhao? Are the two of you alright?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, a series of loud rumbles could be heard from outside the room. Initially, it sounded as though there were a few flashes of lightning across the sky. However, they soon grew in intensity as they gave off the impression that a huge storm was brewing above the temporary palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chain explosion Ju Zi had mentioned to Huo Yuhao had finally started. The comprehensive surveillance system established by the aerial surveillance soul tools was starting to lose its coverage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very next instant, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong appeared before Ju Zi. Now that the surveillance soul tools had been destroyed, they no longer had to worry about being noticed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing how Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were safe and sound, Ju Zi heaved a sigh of relief. At the same time, she was overwhelmed by a complex emotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Both of you…” Ju Zi instinctively spoke. However, she stopped as she found herself at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “We have succeeded. Xu Tianran is dead. I detonated his head with my spiritual attack. The ten people who were protecting him are also dead. Now, we can retreat after fulfilling our promise to you. It is now your turn to fulfill your end of the promise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was elated after hearing what Huo Yuhao had told her. Her body started to tremble in excitement as she exclaimed, “Dead? He’s really dead?” Even though she refused to admit it, Xu Tianran had always been one of the biggest worries on her mind!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared at Ju Zi as various thoughts ran through his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ju Zi, after we part ways today, we might not meet again if you fulfill your end of the promise. Take care of yourself.” Huo Yuhao sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the end of the day, the lady before him was the first female to open up his heart. There was also a period of time when he had hoped that she would change her mind. However, they ultimately were not fated to be together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was naturally able to sense the regret in Ju Zi’s heart. However, he knew that they could not turn back time. It was impossible for them to start over again now that they had missed the opportunity to do so earlier. He already had Tang Wutong, and was incapable of loving another person. In addition, he knew that Ju Zi would never be able to give up on what she had now. She wanted to fight for power for her son, and for the hatred in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had already managed to secure ten years of peace for the Douluo Continent to recover and develop the necessary capabilities to try and defend against the Sun Moon Empire. He was not sure what would happen after those ten years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he had said, this was possibly the last time he would see Ju Zi. After this, he would try to push for the rank of Ultimate Douluo. Following which, he would aim to enter the God Realm. If he was lucky enough to succeed, he would no longer be able to intervene in the Douluo Continent's affairs. Nonetheless, he was still very confused about the feelings he had for the God Realm. He had no idea what that world would be like.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his words, Ju Zi's face turned very pale. "W-Why? What are you planning to do?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and said, "Just as I mentioned to you before, Wutong and I will be going into closed-door cultivation. We have become too powerful in too short an amount of time for our bodies to adjust. It’s time for us to consolidate the power we have gained. I have no idea how long we will be cultivating, but I don't think we will meet in the foreseeable years ahead. Nonetheless, I really hope that you will fulfill your end of the promise. If not, I won't hesitate to kill you with my bare hands."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finishing his sentence, Huo Yuhao stared into her eyes before he turned around and held Tang Wutong's hand. Following which, both of them vanished into thin air before her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tears started to stream down Ju Zi's beautiful face as her body started to tremble vigorously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did he leave just like this?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that instant, she felt that she had really lost him forever. This could really be the last time she saw him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this really the end? Is that it?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ju Zi, why? Why did you make such a foolish decision back them? If you had chosen him back then and let go of all your hatred, you would have been a lot happier. Is revenge really that important? Is power really so important? Hahahaha!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi laughed at herself as tears continued to flow uncontrollably from her eyes. The servants who were waiting outside of the room could not help but shudder. Suddenly, a group of people rushed towards Ju Zi's room.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We are here to see Her Majesty!"</span></p>
