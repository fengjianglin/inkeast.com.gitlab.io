 <p><strong>Book 12: The Strength of the Preparatory Team</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 93.1: Breaking Through the Prison, Domain of Perpetual Ice</strong></p>
 <p>He was likely the first to ever take on the powerful soul skill of a Soul Ancestor as a Soul Grandmaster. However, he was successful.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s hands first turned the color of jade, before numerous resplendent diamond grains swiftly appeared and covered his hands. This pair of hands was akin to a work of art.</p>
 <p>At this moment though, Yan’er was not in the mood to appreciate this work of art. She could feel that her fire type soul power was greatly affected by the ice-cold aura from that pair of hands, giving her the impression that it was being completely forced back.</p>
 <p>How was this possible? How was this possible?</p>
 <p>Yan’er finally couldn’t hold on any longer. The two hands pushed forward and swiftly approached the purple fireball that was heading towards Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>It was clearest to the audience. Forget the fact that the originally massive purple fireball suddenly shrank for no reason while it was flying towards Huo Yuhao, but now it was actually continuing to contract at an astonishing speed. When it arrived in front of Huo Yuhao, it was not even half a foot in size.</p>
 <p>With his right hand directly cutting into it, thick white smoke rose from Huo Yuhao’s right hand. Quickly, with the effect of soul thruster, he broke through the white smoke and arrived in front of Yan’er.</p>
 <p>The reason why he had targeted Yan’er was highly related to his element. Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice was most effective against the ice element, after which was the fire element.</p>
 <p>Under the effect of the Haodong Power from his fusion with Wang Dong, he could already exhibit the power of the Soul Ancestor level. This was also equivalent to possessing Soul Ancestor-level Ultimate Ice. Against another Soul Ancestor of the fire element, Yan’er, Huo Yuhao would clearly gain the upper hand! Thus, what he needed to do was to first snap his opponent’s wings.</p>
 <p>Yan’er was indeed panicking somewhat. The suppressive effect that Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice had on her exceeded even his original estimation. The absolute suppression of elements made Yan’er want to turn around and run away.</p>
 <p>In that brief moment, Ye Wuqing finally recovered from his paralysis. Shangguan Can, who had barely avoided the Golden Leaf’s explosion, also crawled up.</p>
 <p>They never imagined that there would be such an elemental suppression as they watched Yan’er being oppressed by Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, they were currently unable to move to forward and assist Yan’er, because Bei Bei was still in front of them.</p>
 <p>When Huo Yuhao had leapt over his head and pounced at Yan’er, Bei Bei had also lunged forward. However, his target was not Yan’er, but Ye Wuqing. Thus, the moment Ye Wuqing was released from his paralysis, he immediately saw Bei Bei charging towards him. What he needed to do now was protect himself, and thus he was unable to save his companions.</p>
 <p>This scene was somewhat similar to the previous round where Xiao Xiao blocked their opponents to allow He Caitou to build up power. However, there was no doubt that Shrek Academy’s current situation was much better.</p>
 <p>Vigorous Thunderbolt. Bei Bei unleashed his area of effect skill at close proximity without hesitation. Enormous bolts of lightning devastated the sky, forming a giant lightning net. Ye Wuqing could not send out a Golden Leaf even if he wanted to.</p>
 <p>The two who had clashed with words earlier now stood face to face. As Ye Wuqing watched the enormous lightning pounce at him, his eyes suddenly turned golden. It was as if two golden leaves were covering his eyes.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the first and third soul rings on his body simultaneously lit up.</p>
 <p>At least a dozen golden leaves shot out from his hands, instantly turning into a golden net in the air that brazenly flew towards Bei Bei’s Vigorous Thunderbolt.</p>
 <p>Due to the powerful explosive force the Golden Leaf had displayed previously, Bei Bei involuntarily paused. He did not want to be surrounded and blasted by so many golden leaves.</p>
 <p>However, he quickly realised that he had made a mistake, because although they were still the same golden leaves, their ability was different.</p>
 <p>Each Golden Leaf was akin to a sharp blade. The leaves forcibly sliced his Vigorous Thunderbolt apart before sweeping towards his body like a wild storm.</p>
 <p>This was Ye Wuqing’s first soul skill, Leaf Blade, and third soul skill, Leaf Formation. It was this offensive style that he was most proficient with. Under his control, sharp golden leaves headed straight for Bei Bei.</p>
 <p>At this very moment, Bei Bei had a certain feeling. If he were to to be trapped within this Leaf Formation, his entire body would be ripped to shreds.</p>
 <p>However, could he retreat at such a time?</p>
 <p>Impossible!</p>
 <p>Even a little girl like Xiao Xiao had done everything she could in the face of powerful enemies, and even heavy injuries had been unable to deter her as she stopped her opponents; how could he do otherwise?</p>
 <p>A somewhat evil smile appeared on the corners of Bei Bei’s lips at this crucial juncture. He did not back away, but instantly dashed forward instead, charging straight at Ye Wuqing.</p>
 <p>All of this happened in the blink of an eye. On the other side, Huo Yuhao had already achieved decisive results. Both of his hands had arrived in front of Yan’er.</p>
 <p>The Ultimate Ice’s suppression caused Yan’er’s heart to be filled with panic. When a woman fell into such a hysterical state, she would be much crazier than a man. The current Yan’er was no exception. She retreated in a flustered manner as she desperately shot fireball after fireball at Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>However, in the face of Huo Yuhao’s magical hands, any fireballs that locked onto him were already greatly weakened by his Ultimate Ice by the time they neared his body, and could only rapidly dissipate. His Soul Thruster allowed Huo Yuhao’s speed to greatly surpass Yan’er’s. In the end, he arrived in front of her.</p>
 <p>Two hands attacked at the same time. Their targets were Yan’er’s shoulders.</p>
 <p>However, Yan’er suddenly stopped moving at this moment. The panic on her pretty face was cleanly swept off as the corners of her mouth lifted to form an enchanting smile.</p>
 <p>“You’ve been duped, little Brother. Flame Prison Cage. Come down with me.”</p>
 <p>As she spoke, an enormous fiery light abruptly rose from the ground, enveloping Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong and Yan’er. Huo Yuhao’s hands did land on Yan’er’s shoulders, instantly freezing her entire body. However, the huge Flame Prison Cage was already complete. More importantly, with her final bit of willpower, a pair of giant flame hands appeared in the Flame Prison Cage and pushed in the opposite direction, causing the three of them to tumble off the competition stage.</p>
 <p>Only at this moment did Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong realise that Yan’er had unknowingly arrived at the edge of the competition stage. Moreover, the Flame Prison Cage she had unleashed was her fourth soul skill.</p>
 <p>This was the Continental Advanced Academy Soul Duelling Tournament. For Justsky Academy, this was an important battle that would affect its history and glory. How could they be unprepared?</p>
 <p>The moment Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong lunged at Yan’er, she had already realised that the situation was not optimal. However, such a situation was still within their expectations.</p>
 <p>This was not the first time Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice power had seen use. Furthermore, while Justsky Academy was researching Shrek Academy, they concluded that although Huo Yunhao’s strength could not possibly be at the Soul Emperor level, he was still the opponent they needed to pay the most attention to. This was because he was a mystery.</p>
 <p>In their analysis of Huo Yuhao, he possessed very powerful Spiritual Power, but Sky Academy did not believe that his Martial Soul was of the spiritual element. It should be the ice element instead. Moreover, it should be a very strong ice element.</p>
 <p>This was due to the fact that Huo Yuhao had directly taken control of the Frost Bear, An Lengye’s soul skill, during that round of the competition. Although it was close to the end of the soul skill, how could one do this without strong ice controlling powers?</p>
 <p>The reason why Yan’er had been dispatched during the final match was because Ye Wuqing had predicted that Huo Yuhao would also appear in the final match. A powerful ice element would surely be able to suppress the fire element. Since that was so, it was very easy for Ye Wuqing to guess that Huo Yuhao would target Yan’er.</p>
 <p>It was just that their original plan did not account for the fact that he could bring such powerful suppressive abilites to bear. Yan’er’s fireball martial soul was ultimately unable to withstand Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice. Even her fourth soul skill, Flame Prison’s Cage, was unable to threaten Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>However, this competition was not a death match, but a match on the competition stage. Since it was a match, one had to comply with the rules, and it was also reasonable to make use of the rules.</p>
 <p>In this final moment, the debut of her Flame Prison Cage made Yan’er smile rather happily. This was because she had been able to remove two opponents from the stage. One of them was even their opponent’s most mysterious youngster. Without this duo’s help, Sky Academy fully believed that the combination of their captain, the powerful Golden Leaf Soul Master Ye Wuqing, and Shangguan Can would definitely defeat Bei Bei.</p>
 <p>This was basically a trap. This was the same thought that emerged in Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s hearts the moment their bodies were brought tumbling down from the stage.</p>
 <p>Yes. This was indeed a trap, and they had already fallen into it.</p>
 <p>What Huo Yuhao used at this moment was the Ice Emperor’s Pincer. However, even his Ice Emperor’s Pincer could not possibly break the Flame Prison Cage behind him within a short period of time and bring Wang Dong back onto the stage. This was, after all, a level forty-six Soul Ancestor’s final fully-powered soul skill!</p>
 <p>It’s over! This was the only thought in Wang Dong’s heart at this moment. Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine that he and Huo Yuhao would actually be beaten off the stage in such a sullen manner.</p>
 <p>However, it was already too late from them to release any soul skills even if they wanted to at this moment. The Haodong Power he and Huo Yuhao had condensed was under Huo Yuhao’s control. Furthermore, no matter what soul skill he used, he could not instantly break this Flame Prison Cage. Only by instantly breaking the cage would it be possible to change everything.</p>
 <p>Was it truly over?</p>
 <p>As he looked at the smile on Yan’er’s face, Huo Yuhao’s eyes faintly narrowed. In the twinkle of an eye, Yan’er saw a layer of dark green.</p>
 <p>A dark green luster erupted from Huo Yuhao’s body, and the Flame Prison Cage was instantly wiped out, disappearing completely. Wang Dong’s Radiant Goddess Butterfly wings brought Huo Yuhao back onto the stage, while Yan’er was akin to a heavy ice statue as she smashed ruthlessly to the ground, producing a loud ‘bang’. Fortunately, this ice statue was hard enough. Or else, Yan’er’s body would be completely shattered like a piece of ice...</p>
