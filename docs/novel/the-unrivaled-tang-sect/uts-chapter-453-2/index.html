 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong clenched her fists as she turned around and peered into the night sky. She stuck her tongue out at the sky and asked herself,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong, what’s wrong with you? Why are you missing that person? Don’t tell me that you’re jealous? Why? Just because he saved me? No, I can’t be like that. He’s just an ordinary person. Furthermore, he already has a lover. So what if he’s outstanding? He’s not particularly handsome either! Sleep, go and sleep!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she talked to herself, she started to walk towards her tent. However, she was walking very slowly…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-----</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Early morning…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The Immortal Doctor Douluo was delighted as she came to Huo Yuhao’s tent and checked on his condition once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as she had expected yesterday, she managed to break through the bottleneck that she had been facing for years after absorbing Huo Yuhao’s pure life energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She rose from Rank 95 to Rank 96. This last step wasn’t easy. It had taken her close to sixty years! However, she had finally achieved it! Huo Yuhao was undoubtedly responsible for this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why she came in the early morning. Even though she didn’t need to perform any treatment on him, she still had to try her best to help him if he suffered any problems during his recuperation process. It was a form of gratitude to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was in stable condition. His broken passageways were slowly recovering, and he was recovering at a quick rate overall. Apart from the immense life energy in his body, there was another important reason for his speedy recovery: his passageways had immediately frozen in place after they were damaged. They didn’t shift or change their positions at all. As they remained still, they played a very critical role in his recovery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi didn’t sleep the entire night. When she saw the Immortal Doctor Douluo silently nodding as she checked up on Huo Yuhao, she couldn’t help but ask, “Elder Immortal Doctor, how is Yuhao? Will he be fine?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Xian’er glanced at her, and was amused as she said, “Young lady, the more concerned you are, the more disorderly you’ll be. In terms of emotions, you have to work harder. There’s some kind of pent-up stress in you. I assume it has something to do with him? I can sense that your martial soul comes from the same origin as mine. Alright, I shall lend you a hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, the Immortal Doctor Douluo lifted her left hand and gently pressed on Ye Guyi’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi felt a gust of refreshing soul power entering her body. Her entire body seemed to have cleared up. She felt indescribably comfortable afterwards. If not for the fact that Huo Yuhao was sleeping, she would have shouted into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Medicine can cure diseases, but matters of the heart can’t be resolved through medicine. Young lady, I can tell that you really like him. Why? You’re so pretty. Isn’t he satisfied?” Wang Xian’er retracted her left hand and touched Ye Guyi’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi felt much better after the knot in her heart was untied. As she looked at the benevolent look in the Immortal Doctor Douluo’s eyes, her eyes turned red, and she gently shook her head. She said, “He already has someone he likes. I don’t blame him. Perhaps I’m only in love with the fact that he’s so persistent in love.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Immortal Doctor Douluo sighed and said, “Young people! It’s difficult to tell what love is. I was the same when I was young. It’s just that loving someone doesn’t mean possessing that person. Furthermore, there are other things to like and admire in this world. There’s nothing wrong with liking him. Just don’t be too stubborn. Otherwise, you’ll only feel depressed your entire life. You must learn to let go, understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. Thanks for your advice, elder,” Ye Guyi nodded gently. However, she couldn’t help but turn her gaze towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Xian’er smiled slightly. She knew that she couldn’t fully convince Ye Guyi in just a few words, especially when it came to matters of the heart. However, she could tell that she wasn’t a stubborn person. Otherwise, the pent-up stress in her body would be even worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He should be fine. However, he’ll still need time to recover, since his passageways have been so seriously damaged. If I started healing from the start, I’d need at least half a year to fully heal him. I couldn’t even guarantee that there wouldn’t be any side effects. His entire cultivation might even have been disabled. However, his life energy is too strong. He must have experienced something special, and is thus able to recover on his own. In my opinion, he should be fine in at most ten days. I’ve got to say that this is a miracle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Recover in ten days? That’s fantastic!” Ye Guyi couldn’t help but cheer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the curtains to the tent opened, and Nan Qiuqiu walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s so great? Is Yuhao fine?” Nan Qiuqiu quickly walked over to Ye Guyi’s side and looked at Huo Yuhao. Seeing that he was still the same as the night before, a disappointed look came over her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Immortal Doctor Douluo laughed, “Yet another one. There are so many guys out there. Why do all of you fall for the same guy? There’s no future. Isn’t it more painful? However, you aren’t that bad. At least you don’t have a mental knot because of your crush on him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu’s face turned red, and she said, “Elder, don’t make fun of me. I don’t like this guy. It’s Sister Guyi who likes him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Immortal Doctor Douluo laughed, “I’m old, but I’m not blind. If I can’t even tell that you like him, wouldn’t I have lived the last two hundred years in vain? Alright, alright, I won’t bother with the issues of young people anymore. You can deal with your own problems. Remember, don’t touch him. If his passageways move, there’ll be trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes!” Nan Qiuqiu and Ye Guyi hurriedly acknowledged her words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Immortal Doctor Douluo left, and both of them looked at each other. Nan Qiuqiu stuck out her tongue at Ye Guyi, who smiled back. After this, both of them turned their attention to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu twisted her lips and said, “What’s so good about this guy? Who likes him? Hmph! He’s always so mysterious. He’s not even twenty, but he acts like a forty or fifty-year-old man.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi was amused as she looked at her friend. “Why do I recall someone mentioning before that she likes guys who are more mature and capable?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu’s face turned red, and she said, “Is that so? Who said that? Who’s that person with such low taste?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi laughed. “Alright, it’s not you.” Her smile gradually faded away. As she looked at Huo Yuhao, she softly said, “Elder Immortal Doctor said that we should let go. He won’t belong to us. I can actually sense that he’s in pain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? He’s in pain? So many of us like him! Furthermore, he’s the future Hallmaster of the Sea God’s Pavilion. He also holds an important position in the Tang Sect, too! He’s even the in-name Master of the Spirit Pagoda. He’s so decorated. What’s there to feel pain over?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi glanced at her and said, “Now you finally admit that you like him. He’s actually in pain. I can sense it. Everything that you’ve mentioned are his achievements. However, have you ever thought of the amount of pressure he has to bear because of these achievements?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It was still fine in the past, but ever since Dong’er went into a coma, his emotions were greatly affected. After this mission, I even feel that he seems to be less composed than before. If this were the past, he wouldn’t have taken such a huge risk. Last night, I finally understood that maybe he doesn’t want to live anymore. That was why he was willing to take such a huge gamble. Only he knows how painful he feels.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu furrowed her brow and asked, “Isn’t that Tang Wutong Wang Dong’er who has lost her memories? Didn’t everyone claim that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi rolled her eyes and said, “For goodness’ sake, can you be more observant? Haven’t you realized that Huo Yuhao has been very formal towards Tang Wutong? He’s so polite that it feels as if they are strangers. She’s not even as close to him as we are. What does that mean?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Given his character, would he act like that if Tang Wutong was really Wang Dong’er? He must have used some method to verify that Tang Wutong isn’t actually Wang Dong’er. This is why he’s acting like this. It’s also since then that I felt that his emotions have become a little abnormal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing her words, Nan Qiuqiu stuck out her tongue and said, “Hmm, it seems so. If that Tang Wutong isn’t Wang Dong’er, where can Wang Dong’er be then? Actually, I feel that we probably don’t even stand a chance, even if Wang Dong’er is dead. This fellow is too stubborn. He only loves Wang Dong’er. Wang Qiu’er looked so like Wang Dong’er and sacrificed so much for him, but even that didn’t change his heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi said, “This is why we should let go. Let’s keep this as a beautiful memory. We are from different worlds. I only hope that he can find Dong’er soon, and start to feel happy once again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu gave Ye Guyi a weird look, “Sister Guyi, I suddenly feel that you’re very noble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi chuckled and replied, “What’s there to be noble about? If I stood even the slightest chance, I’d do my best to fight for it. I wouldn’t even bother with my face. However, you’ve said it, we have no chance at all. In that case, we can only wish him the best.”</span></p>
