 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason that he was able to last longer and longer against his opponent wasn’t because his abilities had risen to a level where he could rival his opponent. Rather, it was because his opponent’s abilities seemed to become weaker as time passed. Naturally, this enabled him to last longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The longer he lasted, the greater the beatings he suffered. As time passed, he even felt that it would be better to be killed in one hit—at least the pain would only last an instant. That, and he’d only have to suffer the pain of death, rather than suffering the inhumane torture that he was currently being subjected to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slowly, he was beginning to collapse, and became extremely weak and confused. The only thought left was that he knew he had to charge towards his opponent with all his strength. He had to attack, fight, and go all-out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After some time, he was on the verge of collapse. He fainted, but his opponent didn’t kill him this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this strange place, injuries healed at a miraculous speed. Huo Yuhao was able to clearly feel his crushed bones reassembled, his broken passageways re-connected, and his blood begin to circulate through his body once again. He’d already slowly gotten used to the terrifying pain the longer he fought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s so comfortable to just lie down! Why hasn’t he killed me yet?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he finally crawled up from the ground once again, everything around him was empty, replaced by an omni-present golden light. The bluish-gold figure had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Did I pass, or not?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was in a daze as he wondered this.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Going through that unforgettable experience should be enough for me to pass, right?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he had to go through it again, he might really lose his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, was the abuse that he’d gone through really all the test was about? It didn’t feel like things would be so simple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, his surroundings turned into a light fog that rose from the ground. The fog then started to form layers, before distorting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao focused his gaze. At this point, he’d already fully recovered. Although he didn’t know if there would be any more tests for him or if everything had ended, he felt extremely confident. Not only did he not possess any fear, he was instead eager.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The brutal torture that he’d experienced hadn’t been for nothing. His abilities and mental resilience had both improved significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A light flashed, turning the ground into a huge hexagonal projection. Countless esoteric symbols flit about and transformed within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything here was unrestrained, unlike before. Huo Yuhao sensed that his soul power was still circulating properly, and that his spiritual power was no longer suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only depressing thing was that his lower limbs had been frozen once again. The earlier neutralization of the origin energy of Ultimate Ice had lost its effect. Furthermore, he couldn’t connect with his ring in order to unleash his human-shaped soul tool to carry his body. As a result, he could only sit on the ground, using his arms to steady himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, two beams of golden light shone vertically not far in front of him. Two figures slowly became clear and appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two figures were supporting each other. Their entire bodies were stained with blood as they appeared. If not for the fact that Huo Yuhao was familiar with them, he wouldn’t have recognized them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dai Huabin, Zhu Lu?” Huo Yuhao exclaimed in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin also saw him. He lifted his head and struggled to nod. After Huo Yuhao had helped his father the previous time, he was no longer hostile towards him. However, there was a sorrowful look in his eyes at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin was heavily wounded; it was as if he’d just climbed out of a dye vat—his entire body was stained with blood. However, he still remained standing, and was supporting Zhu Lu in his arms. Zhu Lu’s body was convulsing, and she groaned from time to time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could immediately tell that something was wrong with her using his Spirit Eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he focused on Zhu Lu’s body, he was extremely shocked to find out what was happening to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhu Lu was in a tragic state: Her entire right arm had been bent out of shape. As for her face, it was only possible to see half of it, as it was covered in blood and wounds; only half of her nose and one ear remained. The remaining side of her face was extremely pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dai Huabin, Zhu Lu, what’s going on?” Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but ask. It was very difficult for him to move right now, thus he could only sit where he was and question the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin struggled to speak. “She’s been poisoned. To save her…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao understood what was going on. As he looked at the wounds all over Dai Huabin’s body, he suddenly felt that his hatred towards him had slightly diminished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No, no! I can’t forget my hatred towards him. He was the one who hurt mom, who caused her to…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, why didn’t mom let me take revenge, and instead tell me that it was destiny?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt slightly tormented, and shut his eyes. To Dai Huabin, he had a commiserating expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin helped Zhu Lu to the ground as he sat down next her. He lowered his head and let her lie on his thighs. Right now, he didn’t appear nearly as fierce as before. There was only a gentle look in his eyes as he examined Zhu Lu’s injuries. Tears also started to stream down uncontrollably from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lulu, don’t worry. When I decided to chop off your arm, I’d already decided that I’d love you and wed you as my wife no matter what became of you. You’ll always be the most beautiful in my eyes. I’ll kill whoever calls you ugly. I’ll take care of you well. Even if I die, I’ll make sure you don’t come to any harm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin was sobbing. Tears fell from his eyes with every word he said. All the promises in the world couldn’t compare to a real-life experience. As he braved life and death with Zhu Lu, he’d only managed to pass his Sincerity Adventure round after a few close brushes with death. He finally understood his own heart, and what the most important thing to him was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, another two beams of golden light shone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao quickly turned his attention to these two beams of light. While he was in low spirits because of Dai Huabin and Zhu Lu’s condition, he knew that—with the appearance of these two beams of light—it signified that Dai Huabin and Zhu Lu had successfully passed their rounds. This meant that they should be able to leave this place alive. What about the rest of them? The remaining few people were all closely connected to him. They were either his good friends or his seniors. Most importantly, there was also his lover!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two beams of golden light that had just appeared became clear. This time, the two people who’d appeared were in a completely different state than tragicness that had befallen Dai Huabin and Zhu Lu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were still close together, but they were embracing each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi seemed very delighted, and was in high spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ravishing Jiang Nannan was leaning against him in his arms with a blush on her face. She hugged one of his arms and wore a satisfied smile. Although there were tear stains next to her eyes, the two of them exuded a blissful aura.</span></p>

I’m feeling extremely great! Hahahaha!” Xu Sanshi looked at Huo Yuhao and immediately broke out in delighted laughter. However, he soon saw both Dai Huabin and Zhu Lu, and furrowed his brow. He shot an enquiring look at Huo Yuhao afterwards.</span></p>

He was extremely shocked by the condition Zhu Lu was in.</span></p>

He didn’t gloat over their misfortune, and quickly went over to the both of them before squatting down. He slowly released his gentle Xuanwu soul power.</span></p>

It was no longer flawed, and didn’t need to be activated with force. It was a pure Xuanwu!</span></p>

Not only did it remove the bloodstains, but it also cleaned up their wounds.</span></p>

At the very least, it would be able to remove the remaining poison in their bodies.</span></p>

There’s a healing and auxiliary-type teacher who’s a Titled Douluo in the inner courtyard. Perhaps she can help heal her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Dai Huabin seemed to be slightly disinterested, choosing only to hug Zhu Lu tighter.</span></p>

Another person had returned, which proved that another person had passed their test. It was a good thing to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan smiled and nodded at them. After that, she also saw Dai Huabin and Zhu Lu and immediately rushed over. However, she didn’t know how to treat them, and could only comfort them.</span></p>

In the past, she rarely smiled. However, she now seemed to be casually grinning. Even though she’d furrowed her brow after seeing Zhu Lu’s critical injuries, the resentment that was normally there was gone. She seemed more approachable, and her eyes were brighter too. She was different!</span></p>

It’s also the same with third and fourth seniors.</span></p>
