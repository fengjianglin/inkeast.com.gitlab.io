 <p><strong>Book 9: Escape</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 61.2: Icy Domain and the Golden Light</strong></p>
 <p><em><strong>Regarding the fact that there's no chapter 60: The Author omitted it, thus we have too.</strong></em></p>
 <p>However, when he went to the Soul Tool Department in the evening to study with Fan Yu, he finally received good news. This time, the core disciples of the Martial and Soul Tool Departments would jointly participate in the test. In other words, the two departments wouldn’t be separated. In the Soul Tool Department, the number of core disciples under the age of fifteen was scarce. The only ones that could participate and had some hope of being selected were He Caitou and Huo Yuhao. Thus, Fan Yu had directly removed all those students that didn’t have any chance of passing the preliminary round. With that, the number of participants had dropped even more. And since he was a core disciple of both departments, Huo Yuhao could use soul tools during the test! This was a great boost to his fighting capability.</p>
 <p>After consulting with the professors and receiving some pointers from Fan Yu, Huo Yuhao started to create a Class 2 soul tool that would suit him. He had only three days to improve his equipment.</p>
 <p>For the sake of saving time, as soon as he finished his class, he decided to bring all the parts back to the dormitory. He was planning to assemble his soul tool while acting as a protector for Wang Dong, who would absorb the soul bone from the auction in the meantime.</p>
 <p>As soon as he opened the dormitory door, he was welcomed by a burst of warm and comfortable golden light that almost made him jump out of his skin. He quickly closed the door behind him.</p>
 <p>In the middle of their dorm room, Wang Dong was earnestly inspecting the Golden Light Left Arm Bone, which was hovering in mid-air. He seemed completely engrossed by it and didn’t even spare any attention to Huo Yuhao’s return.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao sat beside him and also carefully observed the bone. Without the barrier of the stall, one could completely experience the awesomeness of this bone just by being near it.</p>
 <p>It hadn’t been priced at 9.5 million Gold Soul Coins for nothing! It looked like an artificial sun as it hovered in the middle of the room. It’s warmth filled light had spread to every corner of the room and dispersed every shadow from every corner and nook. Apart from it’s warmth, the golden halo also radiated a faint pressure.</p>
 <p>The most eye-catching parts were the fingertips. They was a pulsating strange reddish-gold light surrounding them which was continuously emitting a sharp ‘chi chi’ sound.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao arrived behind Wang Dong and placed his hands on his vest. After that, he slowly poured his soul power into Wang Dong, activating their Haodong Power.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s whole body shook as he finally came back to his senses.</p>
 <p>“I’m here. You can start.” Huo Yuhao whispered.</p>
 <p>“Fine.” Wang Dong didn’t waste time. He raised his left arm and activated the Haodong Power.</p>
 <p>He had already examined the Golden Light Left Arm Bone for more than two hours. The more he looked at it, the more incredible it felt. The bone also seemed to have felt his gaze. The energy within it had started to rhythmically pulse in sync with Wang Dong’s breath. This made Wang Dong slowly enter a strange meditative state.</p>
 <p>If he had to describe his relationship with this soul bone, the most apt description would be ‘like attracts like’.</p>
 <p>When the soul power of his left arm came in contact the left arm bone, the reddish-gold light rushed toward him and started to twine around his arm.</p>
 <p>Immediately, Wang Dong’s entire body was covered with the shining reddish-gold light. A rich, dense aura of warmth rose and surged about while Wang Dong exhaled deeply. Following which, he closed his eyes and stood there calmly, enjoying the fusion.</p>
 <p>At this point in the fusion process, the Haodong Power was irrelevant. Therefore, Huo Yuhao slowly stopped pouring his soul power into him. After stepping around in front of Wang Dong, he looked at his satisfied face and felt that it was somewhat unfair.</p>
 <p>They had both fused with a soul bone. But why was the difference so big?</p>
 <p>“Idiot. This is called compatibility. This soul bone has a very high compatibility with his body. Therefore, the fusion will also be very simple and quick. On the other hand, what was your cultivation level when you merged with me? Moreover, I was still alive when we combined. It’s already a miracle that you succeeded at all.” The Ice Impress said in a dissatisfied manner.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was startled, “Ice Impress! Skydream! Where did the two of you go?! Didn’t you hear me when I was calling you earlier? Why did the two of you keep ignoring me?”</p>
 <p>Be it when he and Wang Dong were in danger or when he was in that awkward situation with Ma Xiaotao, these two intelligent soul rings had acted as if they didn’t exist.</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm said lazily, “If you rely on us for everything, how are you ever going to become strong? We can help you raise your strength but at the end of the day, the one that has to make the breakthroughs is you. Moreover, the more your cultivation rises, the more you’ll need to rely on yourself. If you can resolve the situation on your own, we’re unlikely to intervene. And you have to remember that we’re only soul rings, not your bodyguards. Our strength has long since merged inside your body. If you encounter a dangerous situation, we’re as powerless as you in dealing with it. In the worst case, we’ll die together with you! That’s why you have to rely on your own power, and not on us.”</p>
 <p>Although Huo Yuhao had already left them very satisfied, nonetheless the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress knew that he would have to do way better if he wanted to become stronger and shock even them.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao hadn’t really blamed them for their actions. Therefore, he immediately said in a somewhat ashamed manner, “I’m sorry. I didn’t think that someone would ambush us. I’ll be more careful from now on.”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm said, “We have good news for you. You didn’t suffer in vain yesterday. Although that girl’s phoenix flames weren’t very pure, their temperature was still quite good. In addition, the benefits your body received from that Ten Thousand Year Whale Rubber were greater than what we had imagined. Therefore, we unsealed some more of our power and merged it with our soul rings and soul bones. Your soul power also increased a bit thanks to the Ice Impress giving you a part of her power. According to our calculations, all of your soul rings can now put out around 4200 years of power. The power of your skills has also slightly increased. However, you’ll need to train even more now. The stronger the soul skill, the larger its consumption of soul power. If you don’t have enough soul power, it will all be for naught.”</p>
 <p>As expected, it was very good news. Huo Yuhao was very happy. It was also the greatest benefit that these two sentient soul rings had brought him. Maybe, if he kept cultivating like this... one day, he wouldn’t need to use his imitation skill to have red soul rings! No one else could raise the strength of their soul rings, but he could!</p>
 <p>“Awesome, thank you very much. I won’t slack off. However, I can’t cultivate tonight since I need to act as a protector for Wang Dong.”</p>
 <p>The fusion between Wang Dong and the Gold Light Left Arm Bone went more smoothly than he had imagined. The entire process from start to finish was completed in less than six hours. The process came to an end as the last thread of reddish-gold light merged into his left arm.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao didn’t sleep for the whole night. While acting as a protector for Wang Dong, he had also been assembling his Class 2 soul tool. Since acting as a protector was distracting, he didn’t engrave the formation arrays. However, he still made a few accessories.</p>
 <p>“Huuuu” After a long exhale, Wang Dong slowly opened his eyes. The reddish-gold light wasn’t flickering through his eyes anymore.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao felt that Wang Dong’s disposition had changed a bit. Before, he had given off a gentle and refined feeling. But now, he seemed somewhat aggressive. It was rather similar to the feeling Ma Xiaotao gave off.</p>
 <p>“How is it?” Huo Yuhao asked quickly.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong nodded and replied, “I’ve succeeded.”</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you try out your soul skill?” Huo Yuhao asked curiously.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong said, “First, tell me about your soul skill. I’ll try mine afterward.”</p>
 <p>“You still remember!” Huo Yuhao said with a smile, “Fine, I’ll tell you. The name of this skill is Domain of Perpetual Ice. It can reduce the temperature within a certain range. That day, those guys were frozen and fell from the sky as a consequence of this skill. What about yours?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong glared at him and responded, “It’s better if you look.” With that, he excitedly raised his left arm. The wings of the Radiant Butterfly Goddess tore the back of his shirt and slowly spread out. Then, his left arm was completely covered in a reddish-gold radiance.</p>
 <p>The reddish-gold light was accompanied by a dragon’s roar as it pushed forwards. Afterwards, a layer of reddish-gold flames started to cover his wings. It seemed as if those already beautiful wings now had an additional outer garment, making them look even bigger. The entire room was filled with the aura of the Radiant Butterfly Goddess.</p>
 <p>“It’s called ‘Golden Light’, and it’s an auxiliary-type skill. It can be used with any of my soul skills. I’m also unaware of its concrete ability. I’ll need to test it out. But it should have the ability to increase the destructive power of my light element.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s eyes lit up. “This soul bone skill can give you an overall power up. I think I’ve heard Teacher Wang say that an ability like this was very rare!”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong, who was releasing the golden light, had an even more surprised look right now. “The restoration rate of my soul power seems to have increased as well. Just like you can feel your soul power slowly reducing when you release your martial soul, right now, I can feel my soul power slowly increasing. Although it’s not very clear, I can still feel it.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao grabbed Wang Dong’s hand. Their soul power mixed, transforming into Haodong Power. Immediately, Huo Yuhao also felt a dense light aura entering Wang Dong’s body, slowly helping him recover his soul power. At this time, his soul power was abundant. Therefore, it was difficult to feel the recovering soul power clearly.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao manipulated his soul power and released several skills, such as Spiritual Detection, Spiritual Sharing, Spiritual Shock, and Spiritual Interference, to consume their Haodong Power.</p>
 <p>Under these circumstances, the feeling became clearer. That dense light aura started to quickly pour into Wang Dong’s body. What made them even more surprised was that after once this light energy had poured into his body, no matter what skill it was, they all had an overall increase in power. The soul power of Huo Yuhao’s Mysterious Heaven Technique was fairly calm and didn’t cause any trouble either. Moreover, after mixing his power with Wang Dong’s and activating the Haodong Power, Wang Dong was also able to directly make use of this power. And now, under the effect of the Golden Light, they could even recover their Haodong Power.</p>
