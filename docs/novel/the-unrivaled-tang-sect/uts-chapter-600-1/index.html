 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao smiled as he said, “I didn’t expect us to meet again so soon.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and said, “Elder, your cultivation is unpredictable! I didn’t expect you to find us even though we’ve been so careful.” Although it was easy to put on makeup, Huo Yuhao naturally understood that they could no longer hide their identities after Long Xiaoyao discovered them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao laughed and said, “What if I told you this was a coincidence. Would you believe me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s lips twisted a little.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I don’t think I need to answer such a dumb question.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He raised his cup of malt wine to express his sincerity before gulping the wine down. The bitter yet fragrant taste of the malt wine immediately overwhelmed his chest area. It was very comfortable, but the bitterness didn’t disappear for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Ye Xishui was one of their targets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the waiter had already delivered the food that Long Xiaoyao wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandpa Long, you haven’t been here for a long time! Quickly, come and taste this delicious piece of beef tenderloin that our chef has chosen.” The waiter passionately put the food in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, help me thank him.” Long Xiaoyao chortled and started to cut up the beef tenderloin with a small knife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The waiter retreated, and Tang Wutong couldn’t help but ask, “You’re already so old, yet you’re still eating meat. Aren’t you afraid of being a laughing stock?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao laughed, “Eating is a joy in life. It’s something we have to do everyday from the day we are born until the day we die. I love meat. If I can’t even eat meat, what’s the point of living?” As he spoke, he started to gulp down wine and meat together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little pensive as he looked at Long Xiaoyao and said, “Right now, I actually believe that our meeting is a coincidence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao chuckled and said, “That’s why I said that we are fated, are we not? Share whatever you are seeing with me. I know you have that ability.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t help it, and shared what he was seeing with Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao was definitely more familiar with the imperial palace than he was. He immediately discovered something wrong with the four corners of the palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao was perplexed as he asked, “Oh? What’s that? Four corners are brightly lit?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “If I’m not wrong, they should be high-energy compression array soul tools. Elder Ye is also a Class 9 soul engineer. You should have heard of such a soul tool before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s expression immediately changed. “What did you say? They’re high-energy compression array soul tools? No, impossible. The Sun Moon Empire only has such soul tools outside the city. Why are they in the palace?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “I was supposed to check out the palace today. However, I had an ominous feeling before I entered. That’s why I’m here. After that, I went to observe. Elder Ye seems to have just gone in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s expression immediately turned grim. He took a big gulp of malt wine and squinted. “The Sun Moon Empire’s power has really exceeded our expectations. Continue observing.” He didn’t immediately leave after discovering the high-energy compression array soul tools. He continued eating his beef and drinking his wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he wasn’t anxious, there was less of a need for Huo Yuhao to be anxious. However, he maintained his Spiritual Detection out of respect for Long Xiaoyao. He didn’t check things out further. In his heart, he couldn’t wait for Xu Tianran and Ye Xishui to fight. That would fit his interests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A huge piece of beef tenderloin was quickly consumed by Long Xiaoyao. He even had another cup of wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao seemed to enjoy it a lot. He was all smiles as he looked at Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although Mu En is gone, he should be laughing even in the afterlife since he’s got a disciple like you! It’d be great if I had a disciple like you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it were someone else, he would immediately give up everything to become Long Xiaoyao’s disciple. However, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were already both the disciples of the Dragon God Douluo Mu En. Naturally, they wouldn’t do that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re exaggerating.” Huo Yuhao hurriedly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao shook his head and said, “I’m not. I’m being serious. When Mu En and I were your age, we were too inferior compared to both of you. There are even a few fellows from the Tang Sect who aren’t faring worse than us at their age.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t know how to react. He only smiled. In fact, he couldn’t determine whether Long Xiaoyao was a friend or foe even up until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Teacher said that he’s secretly protecting me. However, he’s also a supreme elder of the Holy Ghost Church! He’s always been by Ye Xishui’s side, helping her commit evil. Without him, the Holy Ghost Church wouldn’t have been able to develop so quickly over the past few years. Its success is closely tied to the Dragon God Douluo, Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao sighed. “Little Huo, do you look down on me and think that I’m a disgrace to have earned my reputation along with your teacher?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was astonished. He honestly replied, “There was once a period of time when I did think that way. However, I learned more after that. I guess you must have some things that you can’t say.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao smiled, and seemed to be very happy. “Very good. At least you’re not lying to me. That’s a virtue, even though white lies are important sometimes. You seem to be disapproving with your words. Do you think that I should not be committing evil even if there are things that I can’t say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took a mouthful of the malt wine and tried to hide his awkwardness. “Elder, you’re really very sharp. Nothing escapes your eyes. I apologize for my actions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao shook his head and replied, “There’s nothing to be apologetic about. Almost everyone thinks the same way as you. Even my friends and family think the same too. It’s just I really have no choice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He retracted his smile. What replaced it was a look of unhappiness and pain that couldn’t be wiped away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me tell you. There are many things which aren’t that simple. I’ve not told this matter to anyone before. If I don’t say it now, I might not get a chance again. Do you want to listen to it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Can we say no?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were both curious about his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They nodded at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao sighed and revealed a lost look in his eyes. “We’ll have to go way back to the start. Then, Mu En, Ye Xishui and I met one another when we traveling outside. Mu En and I met the earliest. We only knew each other through fighting. He had the Radiant Holy Dragon, while I had the Darkness Holy Dragon. We were each the other’s nemesis. That’s why we were foes the moment we met. Our cultivations were similar, and our ages were also around the same. How could we not be competitive? Within a year, we fought seven times. Each time, the victor was different. Eventually, I lost one more time than him. Among the seven fights, I won three and he won four. He won against me, most notably during the finals of the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament. He won against the team that I led. It was also then that I first met Ye Xishui. She was the only female soul master that could challenge us in terms of cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he said that, a smile appeared on Long Xiaoyao’s face. Whatever happened in the past was undoubtedly the best things that had happened in his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After fighting for close to a year, we became closer because of one matter. We met a village that was harmed by evil soul masters. The evil soul masters were on a killing spree. They were using human souls and corpses to cultivate. We passed that village from different places. When we saw the tragic state it was in, we couldn’t help but intervene. When we finally killed all the evil soul masters, we realized that we were helping one another. Suddenly, we laughed, and became good friends from then on.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mu En is a composed person. I’m more rebellious. To be honest, I was really slightly more handsome than your teacher then. Haha!” Long Xiaoyao laughed. He was even laughing very heartily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong couldn’t refute this point. Although Long Xiaoyao was already very old, he was still very big and tall. It was also clear how he looked when he was younger. Huo Yuhao even felt that the Darkness Holy Dragon was more handsome than him when he was younger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao followed with, “We started to travel around the continent and faced many experiences. We also teamed up together quite frequently. Then, we were astonished to find out that our martial souls were complementary even though their types were completely different. We even managed to unleash a fusion skill once. Darkness and light can actually come together. Don’t you think it’s very magical?”</span></p>

Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong stared at each other. This was really new information for them. Neither Elder Mu nor Elder Xuan had told them about this matter. Could darkness and light actually fuse?</span></p>

It turned out that Elder Mu and Long Xiaoyao knew each other from the tournament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mu En and I analysed the situation. We believe that we were able to use fusion skills because of the connection between our martial souls. Even though darkness and light were opposites, there was something we shared. It’s that our martial souls are both dragons. We only completed our fusion because of this similarity in our lineages. However, our martial souls were only fifty percent compatible. An extremely destructive force could be generated when darkness and light clashed as we fused our martial souls. However, it couldn’t increase our cultivations. Compared to your fusion, we were a long way off.”</span></p>
