 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “That’s not a problem. However, I just want to know what you’re checking for. What are you trying to feel in me?” He was clearly unconvinced that Tang Wutong only wanted to sense his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong pursed her lips and answered, “Did you tell me the reason when you did this to me before? You only patronized me with a few words.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright. Do it then.” Huo Yuhao only wanted to leave now. Furthermore, he was also confident that Tang Wutong wouldn’t harm him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surface of the lake was already frozen solid. Tang Wutong directly walked off of her lotus leaf towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan and Han Ruoruo didn’t stop her. Everyone was watching quietly. Huo Yuhao was also unaware what Tang Wutong was going to do, much less the rest of the people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The distance between them closed quickly, Tang Wutong stopped in front of Huo Yuhao. She nodded at him and said, “I’m going to begin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t answer, and only quietly spread his arms. It actually looked like he was about to catch her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s face turned red. After hesitating slightly, she lifted her hands and placed them on his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s hands were soft and delicate. One could be aroused even touching her tender palms. Huo Yuhao was startled, and tried to force himself to detach Wang Dong’er from his thoughts. However, he realized that he couldn’t do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong and Wang Dong’er were simply too alike. Even if they were different people, it was almost impossible to not link them together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t Huo Yuhao’s first time sensing her soul power, and she gradually poured her soul power into his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Precisely because he had experienced it before, he knew that Tang Wutong’s soul power was extraordinary. Although it wasn’t like his Ultimate martial soul, Huo Yuhao felt that her soul power was even stronger than his Ultimate Ice soul power. Her soul power contained something that wasn’t in his soul power, something that seemed extraordinary and seemed to have been enhanced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for what it was, Huo Yuhao couldn’t say in detail. However, he was certain that it existed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 22pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t resist at all. He allowed Tang Wutong to freely pour her soul power into him and touch his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his cultivation increased, the quality of Huo Yuhao’s soul power was not that far from Tang Wutong’s, especially after he absorbed the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, even though there were still some qualitative differences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Huo Yuhao suddenly saw Tang Wutong smiling. He was a little stunned when he looked at her, as he didn’t know why she was smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was at this time that a pair of huge golden wings appeared behind Tang Wutong. Soul rings also started to surface from her feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black, black, black, black, black, black, red, and red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were actually eight soul rings. They were even fully complementary. There were six ten-thousand-year soul rings and two hundred-thousand-year soul rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was astonished at this moment. He also didn’t know that Tang Wutong was actually a Soul Douluo.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She actually has eight rings already. She went into closed-door cultivation earlier so that she could obtain eight rings?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, even if she has eight rings and wants to demonstrate her abilities to me, what’s the point of doing so?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were dense scaly patterns on her wings, which were dragon wings. Tang Wutong’s martial soul was the powerful Radiant Dragon God’s Butterfly. Although they were dragon wings, they were still shaped like butterfly wings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Huo Yuhao was confused about what Tang Wutong was doing, her forehead suddenly lit up. A golden trident was exuding a strong glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt instantly felt dizzy when he saw the glow from the golden trident. However, there was a weird sense of closeness, as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An astonishing scene appeared. Tang Wutong’s wings fluttered gently, and streaks of golden light started to spread out like fog. As these streaks of light quickly spread, they actually surged towards the trident on her forehead, and were quickly absorbed by the golden trident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was shocked as he looked at Tang Wutong. He was the closest to her, and her soul power was inside him, and he could feel it most acutely. However, he couldn’t understand what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t just Tang Wutong’s wings that had experienced changes. Even the soul power that was pouring into his body was experiencing changes. Some of the changes were more obvious: the something in her soul power that Huo Yuhao had sensed earlier was rapidly weakening, whereas that familiar and close feeling he had sensed was becoming stronger and stronger. The intense discrimination of his soul power was also gradually disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her soul power and martial soul are actually changing? Is this even possible? Don’t tell me that this is her self-invented soul skill?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a genius, and believed that he had a deep understanding of soul masters, since he was the person who had invented Spirits. Moreover, there were also the Snow Empress, Ice Empress, and Skydream Iceworm within him. Much of their knowledge had been imparted to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao didn’t get a reply when he tried to call to them. All of them, including the Ice Bear King and the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass, were asleep. They didn’t respond at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slowly, Huo Yuhao’s eyes opened wider and wider. Tang Wutong’s wings were gradually changing...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, her scales became illusory, as if they had been absorbed by the wings. The dragon scales gradually disappeared. The original golden glow also slowly dimmed. The edges of the wings started to turn a dim blue. Furthermore, that color was slowly intensifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This, this…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul power that Tang Wutong poured into him slowly started to change. It was becoming more and more complementary to his soul power, and even started to entangle itself with it. After this, it even…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slowly! Gradually! Fused!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was in a daze right now.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fuse? It actually fused? Even though the speed of fusion is slow, it’s still fusing! It’s slow, but continuous!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s as if… it’s like it was before…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Haodong Power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s heart was shaking. He had only patronizingly raised his hands, but now he subconsciously tightened his grip on hers. The way he looked at her also started to change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The draw from Tang Wutong’s forehead was becoming stronger and stronger as golden light fused with the golden trident. The wings behind her back and the scales on her wings had completely disappeared, and were quickly turning blue. There was now a V-shaped golden pattern covering the blue of her wings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was no longer the Radiant Dragon God’s Butterfly. It was…the Radiant Butterfly Goddess!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s heart was completely gripped right now. At this moment, the pain in his heart had completely disappeared. What replaced it was only a strong sense of suffocation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was his first time experiencing what a miraculous recovery was. At this instant, the seemingly pitch-black night sky had finally brightened up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong looked at Huo Yuhao. There seemed to be boundless love and yearning in her captivating eyes. She smiled, and her discomfort seemed to have disappeared. What was left was only that teasing look. However, there was a crystal-clear tear in her eyes at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the boat, everyone, including Elder Xuan, stood up. They were all stunned. Huo Yuhao didn’t know what was going on, and neither did they. No one could guess what had actually happened to Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, the last streak of golden light was absorbed by Tang Wutong’s golden trident. What was left was only the combination of blue and gold, the combination that he was most familiar with. The combination that he had been thinking of all this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Am, am I in a dream?” Huo Yuhao was in a daze as he looked at Tang Wutong. His voice was trembling madly. It was trembling so much that it didn’t even seem like he was talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Idiot,” Tang Wutong snorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Idiot? What a familiar word!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao only felt a stinging feeling in his eyes, and tears flowed out uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, there wasn’t any derogatory connotation to this call. It made him feel as if the entire world was blissful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the negative emotions in his heart seemed to have been split apart and swept away at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to say something, but there was something in his throat. He couldn’t say a single word more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, soul power surged from Tang Wutong’s hands. It was very strong, and instantly surged into Huo Yuhao’s body. During this process, Huo Yuhao’s Mysterious Heaven Technique was subconsciously fusing with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! This was the Haodong Power that they both possessed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last time they had fused was on the Sun Moon Empire’s battlefield. Back then, Huo Yuhao was not even a Soul Emperor. Now, they were both Soul Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The immense soul power raged through Huo Yuhao’s body. The soul core on his forehead was stimulated, and opened up. His soul power was being enhanced at an alarming speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was unprecedentedly strong. Huo Yuhao only felt that countless whirlpools seemed to have appeared in his fluid soul power. Every whirlpool was crazily absorbing and compressing soul power, making him stronger and stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was in control of his soul power. It started to take form as it flowed from his right hand through him, out from his left hand, and entered Tang Wutong.</span></p>
