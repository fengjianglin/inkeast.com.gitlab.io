He couldn’t help but ask, “You didn’t rest well last night?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “I didn’t rest at all. I was discussing soul tools with a teacher until morning. Senior Mo Xuan, it seems like you didn’t sleep well either?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan laughed bitterly too. “My mind was filled with soul tools! You gave me a huge biscuit, and this biscuit is absolutely delicious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Huo Yuhao was a little lost, he quickly understood after he heard Mo Xuan’s words. “Senior Mo Xuan, you want to learn how to use soul tools, am I right? That’s not a problem. I’ve already suggested it to the academy, and Elder Xuan, Dean Yan, and Dean Xian have all approved it. The academy is about to start teaching everyone how to use soul tools.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan’s eyes lit up. He knew he hadn’t made a wasted trip after hearing this news!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Huo Yuhao spoke, he walked into the hall. It was still early. Even if everyone was up, they were still washing up and having breakfast. The front courtyard was very quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao offered Mo Xuan a seat and poured him a cup of water. After that, he said, “Senior Mo Xuan, you can ask me anything you want. As long as I know, I will answer you.” Although he was tired, he had a good impression of Mo Xuan, and was willing to give him a hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan also said without any hesitation, “Yuhao, you don’t have to keep calling me senior either. I feel very embarrassed in front of you. As a senior, I’m not that capable. If you treat me as a friend, you can call me directly by my name.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and replied, “Alright then. Mo Xuan, you can ask me anything if you have any doubts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan said, “Yuhao, can you tell me what level I’ll be able to reach if I start learning about soul tools now? You should know that my martial soul is slightly special. When I exhibit my soul skills, I don’t really need to control them, since they’re all domain-type soul skills. I’ve also learned many things in the academy, but I’m restricted by my martial soul. This knowledge only serves to enrich me. I want to be a soul engineer. I want to be like all of you, fighting against our enemies and not hiding behind everyone’s backs.” When he reached this last sentence, he sounded much more agitated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao thought for a moment before asking, “Senior Mo Xuan, how old are you now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan said, “Twenty-five.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “You are already pretty old if you want to start learning about soul tools. All the aspects of knowledge regarding the creation of soul tools are very complex. You need to have a strong foundation first. It’s very difficult.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan was anxious after hearing his words, “However, didn’t you tell me that…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao lifted his hand to interrupt him and said, “Don’t be anxious. Let me finish speaking. You are indeed a little too old to learn about creating soul tools. However, it’s not too late for you to start using them. For soul masters like the two of us, using and creating soul tools are completely different things. My suggestion earlier was for you to try using soul tools to protect yourself and increase your fighting strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan continued to probe, “What standard can I reach if I only choose to use them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “If you are just using them, I recommend you use all-terrain soul forts because of your situation. Not only will they help you raise an all-around defense, but they are also very strong, since they are quite large. With sufficient Milk Bottles, you’ll greatly enhance your survivability and fighting stamina on the battlefield.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Xuan Ziwen’s research of Sealed Milk Bottles was completed, many soul tools could be greatly transformed. This was especially applicable for soul tools that were sizable. Even though it would take some time to charge them, they could be used for a long time without worrying about when the soul power in the Milk Bottles would be depleted. Furthermore, a soul master wouldn’t have to worry about the depletion of their own strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the appearance of such Milk Bottles and the Tang Sect’s techniques, it was no longer a dream for ordinary people to use soul tools in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan nodded and said, “Does this also mean that my fighting strength will increase as such soul tools become stronger? How long will it take me to learn how to use them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “You’ll need at least a month to learn basic control of them. If you want to master them, you’ll need at least three months. Controlling soul tools is a matter of practice. You are a Soul Emperor, meaning that you’ll have sufficient time to practice every day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan clapped his hands in excitement and said, “Great, I’ll learn how to control this all-terrain self-driving fort then. After I return, which teacher from the Soul Tool Department should I find to help me with my learning?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stumped by this question, and replied helplessly, “You won’t be able to learn all this in the academy now. The academy can only start from the basics, so that you can learn how to use a greater variety of soul tools in the future. Furthermore, the all-terrain self-driving fort was the product of my research on all-terrain exploration soul tools when I was in the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. I made refinements and eventually came up with it. There should only be one of it in existence here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan was in a daze. “One only? Can you sell it to me then? I know it’s not going to be cheap, but I’ll try my best to come up with the money.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “I’m sorry, Mo Xuan. It’s not that I don’t want to sell it to you, but because there’s still a lot of confidentiality surrounding the techniques that were used in the creation of this soul tool. We must keep it a secret. In addition, there’s still further research and development to be done. It’s a first model for us. If we give it to you, we won’t have anything to work with anymore. Let me drop you a suggestion; I’ll give you priority to get one when Tang Sect starts to mass produce it in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan was filled with disappointment. “How long will I have to wait? I still have to learn how to use it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t answer this question. Xuan Ziwen was the only one who could answer how long it would take to produce this soul tool. There were many materials involved in making an all-terrain self-driving fort. There were even a few problems regarding its production that had to be rectified in various aspects. Furthermore, mass production would also reduce the quality of an all-terrain self-driving fort, since cheaper materials would be used for production. In addition, all this could only be completed after continuous tests. Huo Yuhao couldn’t give him an exact time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan furrowed his brow upon seeing how Huo Yuhao was being put in a spot. He was like a helpless person drifting in the ocean right now, who had found a life buoy; but the life buoy belonged to someone else, and he couldn’t use it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao asked, “Actually, you can strengthen your foundation by starting to learn how to use basic soul tools first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan replied, “I understand what you mean. I’ll learn how to use basic soul tools. However, your self-driving fort is too attractive. I’m already too eager. Yuhao, do you think this could work…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He paused for a moment at this point, as if he were very determined. He said, “Let me join the Tang Sect. In this way, I’ll also have the responsibility of guarding the Tang Sect’s secrets. I can also learn about the self-driving fort at the same time. Will this work?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao jumped in shock. “Mo Xuan, are you certain? Although we’ve just been re-established, we are still a sect. It’s easy to enter a sect, but it’ll be slightly more troublesome if you want to leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan said, “Since I’ve chosen to join the sect, why would I want to leave? However, will the Tang Sect be willing to accept a trashy person like me, who has no fighting strength?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Trashy? Stop kidding. There are no trashy characters in our inner courtyard. If you are willing to join the Tang Sect, I’ll welcome you with open arms and legs!” Huo Yuhao was delighted, and his fatigue seemed to have disappeared. Although he didn’t know the effective range of Mo Xuan’s Halo, he guessed that it must be very strong given how greatly the academy valued him. Strong soul masters would also be very useful for his future plans!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan asked, “After joining the Tang Sect, does that mean that I can…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded his head immediately. “Of course. You don’t have to only use it in the Tang Sect either. I’m the only one in Tang Sect who knows how to use it. When we are in the inner courtyard, I can teach you.”</span></p>

I’ll learn it first! When you come up with a better one in the future, you must sell me one!”</span></p>

You dragged someone else over? Inner courtyard too? Mo Xuan, why does he sound so familiar? Don’t tell me that he’s the one that can enter the Sea God’s Pavilion when he obtains eight rings? Yuhao, how did you do it?” Bei Bei spoke extremely quickly. He looked at Huo Yuhao as if he were looking at a freak.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao had brought several members into the sect. They included Na Na, the soul engineers who were victimized by the Holy Ghost Church, Ji Juechen, Jing Ziyan, the two Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears, and even the chief researcher of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. What could he not do?</span></p>

He naturally understood more about the situation in the inner courtyard then Huo Yuhao, so he naturally knew more about Mo Xuan than Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

Mo Xuan was just attracted by my all-terrain self-driving fort. However, you know that this thing can’t spread. I didn’t say anything before he offered to join the Tang Sect. Can’t he do so?”&nbsp;</span></p>
