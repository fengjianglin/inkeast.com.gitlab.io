 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong turned her head and looked at Huo Yuhao. She asked seriously, “If you used the Yin Yang Complement, how confident are you? Also, have you ever thought of the fact that you’ll have to cultivate a third soul core? Otherwise, you won’t become a Titled Douluo. If you use Resonance instead, you’ll use the same method when it comes to your third soul core. It’s just more difficult compared to your second soul core. However, how are you going to do it if you used the Yin Yang Complement? At least, I don’t have a clue. Di Tian has been famous for hundreds of thousands of years, but he only has two soul cores. Doesn’t he want a third soul core? He must not have succeeded so far. This shows how difficult it is to cultivate a third soul core after using the Yin Yang Complement to cultivate a second soul core.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” After listening to Tang Wutong’s words, Huo Yuhao nodded. He definitely knew that her words were very logical. However, he was indignant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wutong, whichever method you use, a third soul core has always been a myth. When I chose to form my first soul core, I did it to increase the speed of my cultivation. I’m not sure if I can continue to create miracles when it comes to my third soul core. However, I believe that I can challenge the Beast God even if I don’t become an Ultimate Douluo if I use the Yin Yang Complement to cultivate my second soul core. Don’t forget that I’m also a Class 9 soul engineer. When I become a Transcendent Douluo in the future, I can try to become a Class 10 soul engineer. That’s why I really want to try.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong nodded and said, “How confident are you then? Or rather, what can you rely on? If it’s too dangerous, I won’t let you try at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “Honestly speaking, I’m a little confident. I’ve been cultivating every day. You should be able to sense how strong my body is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his words, Tang Wutong turned slightly red. “Who’s sensing your body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao also chuckled, “See, thinking isn’t healthy. I’m talking about my physical strength. I’ve taken a lot of treasures. I’ve also been nourished by the Life Gold. My life energy is much stronger than most ordinary soul masters. I’m confident in this aspect. While almost all the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence in my body has been absorbed, there’s still some left in my spirit. Once I try for my second soul core, this strength can be tapped into. Forming a soul core requires a lot of energy. It should be able to satisfy this requirement. Also, my spiritual power is strong enough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ve been tirelessly cultivating over the past two years. I’m also astonished by the improvements to my spiritual power. I’m not sure about the exact level of my spiritual power now, but I feel that I’m at the tier of a Transcendent Douluo. This will help me with the control of my soul power, which far exceeds that of ordinary people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really want to give it a go. Even if it’s dangerous, I’ll invite Elder Xuan to protect me. I’m sure I can deal with any danger in time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that he was so persistent, Tang Wutong nodded after pondering for a moment. She replied, “Alright then. You can give it a go. However, you must not force the issue.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was delighted. In fact, if he couldn’t force it, he wouldn’t want to hide anything from Tang Wutong. Even if there was a possibility that they would be separated, he would rather give up on his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong revealed a slight smile on her face. “In that case, I’ll choose the same path as you when I reach Rank 98 in the future. You’ll need to impart your experience to me then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little helpless as he commented, “You’re so competitive!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong replied, “I’m not competitive. I just cannot lag behind you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao didn’t stop her. Given her abilities, she wasn’t any weaker than him, especially in terms of her talent. Huo Yuhao could subtly sense that her abilities and potential had become a little unpredictable ever since she had returned as Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Tang Wutong became a Titled Douluo, it was when Huo Yuhao was creating a Class 9 soul tool with Xuan Ziwen. Huo Yuhao didn’t know how she made a breakthrough, but he knew that she owned her own Spirit after that. Her ninth soul ring was her Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for cultivating her second soul core, it was still too early. She had to try first before she could determine anything. If Huo Yuhao opposed her now, he was just looking for trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their journey was very peaceful. The Star Luo Empire’s aerial surveillance soul tools couldn’t possibly detect them. The two of them were close to the Ming Dou Mountain Range by noon time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ming Dou Mountain Range was a very important location. Here, there were many more aerial surveillance soul tools. Furthermore, the Star Luo Empire’s army had also been re-deployed. Even though it was difficult to tell what the re-deployment was like, it seemed like there had been major changes. Without a doubt, these changes were made in accordance to the Sun Moon Empire’s fighting strategy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they were still fifty kilometers from the Ming Dou Mountain Range, Huo Yuhao deliberately held onto Tang Wutong and slowed down. They were then discovered by the aerial surveillance soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was to avoid any unnecessary trouble. After this, both of them drifted in the air and waited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, the Star Luo Empire reacted very quickly. In just a short period of time, a group of soul masters flew towards them using flying-type soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were ten of them. Perhaps it was because the Star Luo Empire had managed to get an upper hand over the Sun Moon Empire when they used such small groups, but they had started to fancy them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This group of soul masters was very friendly. Evidently, they had been waiting near the aerial surveillance soul tools. In addition, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong came from the mainland. It was more likely that they were friendly instead of hostile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao retrieved the letter for this mission that Elder Xuan had passed to him. He was immediately recognized and led towards the Ming Dou Mountain Range by this group of soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For some reason, Huo Yuhao felt different every time he came to the Ming Dou Mountain Range. He was about to meet the White Tiger Duke again. This time, he was much less hateful than before. However, there was some reluctance on his part to face the White Tiger Duke again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every time he thought of how the White Tiger Duke had hugged him and flown into the sky, he would have some kind of weird feeling. Even if he was unwilling to admit it, he knew that he was proud to have such a father. Without the White Tiger Duke, the Star Luo Empire’s borders wouldn’t be in such a state. In addition, the pressure on the Heavenly Soul Empire wouldn’t have fallen so quickly either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was indeed a cornerstone figure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong whispered, “You’re a little nervous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao forced a laugh, “No I’m not!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong chuckled and said, “How dare you deny it? Your hands are already full of sweat. Don’t worry. I’m by your side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” After hearing her words, Huo Yuhao felt much more relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The main peak of the Ming Dou Mountain Range was where the Death God Douluo and Di Tian had clashed. Right now, the White Tiger Duke’s commander tent was located on this main peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were escorted there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, the mountain had been through some changes. It was very flat now. The edges of it bristled with soul tools, which made it seem as if there were soul formations present. Among them were Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons. They were even present in the greatest numbers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slightly further back were other tents. The White Tiger Duke had chosen this mountain to place his commander tent because the view was the best from here. The situation in the Sun Moon Empire could be most easily observed from this mountaintop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of surveillance, the Star Luo Empire had indeed put in a lot of hard work. At least in terms of defense, these surveillance soul tools had helped greatly. On a few occasions, some small-scale penetrations by soul engineers from the Sun Moon Empire were discovered, and dealt with in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they landed, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were directly led into the tent by the group of soul masters that had received them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he even entered, Huo Yuhao unleashed his Spiritual Detection, as he often did. There were more than ten people in the tent. Each of their auras was also very dominant, and fairly strong. However, none of them noticed Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao held onto Tang Wutong as he walked into the tent. Once he entered, he became the focus of everyone’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a huge table in the center of the tent. The White Tiger Duke was standing at the edge of the center of the table. When he saw Huo Yuhao, a surprised look flashed across his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dai Yueheng and Dai Luoli were both there as well, behind the White Tiger Duke. Dai Yueheng was dressed like a general, while Dai Luoli was dressed as a bodyguard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was familiar with many of the people around the table. Among them, the one who caught his attention the most was Du Busi. He was actually here.</span></p>
