 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body glowed with a layer of faint light as he hovered in midair. Immense spiritual power expanded with his body at the center like an enormous pool of water that stretched over the entire Great Star Dou Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m coming, Di Tian!” Four simple words became like tidal waves of consciousness as they travelled into the Great Star Dou Forest. Huo Yuhao’s consciousness traversed the entire forest, and that frightening spiritual will caused all the soul beasts to tremble fearfully, including the hundred thousand year soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the Great Star Dou Forest’s core region, at the Lake of Life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An enormous head suddenly emerged from the bluish-green lake water as water rippled and splashed in all directions, and dense life energy permeated the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The creature’s large golden eyes gradually opened, and a gigantic frame gradually rose through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re finally here? I’ve waited for you for a long, long time.” A deep voice resonated in the heavens, and waves of sound rolled through the air as the Great Star Dou Forest’s skies began to contort. The sky’s color slowly changed, as the originally radiant sunlight was immediately covered by dark clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hovered in midair, and he was unmovable against the dark clouds’ overbearingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have also waited for this day for a long, long time.” Huo Yuhao stared towards a certain direction calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A pillar of smoke and mist rose from that direction. It was just a tiny sphere in the beginning, but the smoke swiftly magnified like an enormous smoke dragon rising into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lively Great Star Dou Forest became completely quiet in this moment, and not a single sound could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clouds and smoke condensed as the Beast God, Di Tian appeared. Di Tian’s long hair was draped over his shoulders, and he placed his hands behind his back as he appeared before Huo Yuhao just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian’s deep eyes were trained on Huo Yuhao’s body. He stared at this unassuming youth, and he nodded slightly. “I knew that this day would come when I didn’t capture you on that fateful day. I just didn’t expect it to come so quickly. The power of destiny has covered everything about you. I searched for you for over a year, but wasn’t able to find a single trace. You dare to seek me out today, so you must have some level of confidence?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled faintly as he stared back at the Beast God. They were like old friends who hadn’t seen each other for a long time, and Huo Yuhao answered, “You’re like a towering mountain before me, and I will never reach the pinnacle if I don’t cross it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian smiled coldly and said, “Then we shall see if I’ll keep the Great Star Dou Forest’s destiny behind, or if you’ll step over me to search for your God Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t surprised that Di Tian knew about his pursuit of the God Realm. The Beast God wouldn’t be known as such if he couldn’t feel Huo Yuhao’s intentions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Up.” Di Tian growled as he took a step forward. Silver light flickered, and he disappeared into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled faintly, and he also stepped into space with a single step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Battles between individuals of their level were a lot simpler, but more dangerous than anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The originally clear skies darkened almost instantaneously. Dim light rays portrayed a strangely beautiful picture, and there wasn’t any pressure at all. Instead, the skies appeared to be sublimating in some exalted fashion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two beams of silver light emerged through these dark clouds almost at the same time as Huo Yuhao and Di Tian appeared ten thousand meters above the ground at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not even Titled Douluo could reach such an altitude. The air at this altitude was at extremely low temperatures, and also extremely thin. There were also vigorous gales billowing through the skies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normal living beings appearing at this altitude would immediately be ground to dust and obliterated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao and Di Tian looked like they were stepping on level ground as they appeared, and nothing seemed to change. Furthermore, the distance between them was identical to back when they had first met each other above the Great Star Dou Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian nodded in Huo Yuhao’s direction. “I haven’t had such fighting spirit like I am feeling today, and nobody has challenged me for many years. The truth is, I’m very lonely.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “I can feel that your yearning towards life isn’t that strong. Why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian smiled faintly and replied, “You wouldn’t ask me that question if you’ve lived for a few hundred thousand years. I’m familiar with every speck of dust within the Great Star Dou Forest, and I’ve seen every detail that has happened in the world. I am already sick and tired of this place. It is duty that has kept me here so that I cannot leave. Otherwise, I would rather use my future life to pursue new and mystical things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? What is considered new and mystical to the Beast God?” Huo Yuhao asked a little curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A look of yearning appeared in Di Tian’s eyes. “I wish to pursue worlds outside the Douluo Continent. I travelled the world when I was younger, and did you know that our world is a giant sphere? If you fly in a single direction, you will ultimately circle back to where you started. The ocean takes up most of our world, and there are barely a few patches of land. The Douluo Continent is the most advanced one, in addition to the Sun Moon Continent that came afterwards. Of course, only the Douluo Continent remains, and the Sun Moon Continent is no more. I was born in the Douluo Continent, so I am happy to see this result.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared at him in astonishment. “Our world is round?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian nodded and said, “Yes. Furthermore, all the stars that we can see every night are all spheres, including the sun and the moon.” Di Tian was like an intellectual who had accumulated his knowledge over a hundred thousand years in this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Therefore, I wish to see other planets and stars aside from our own. I’ve already attempted to fly even higher. The pressure and restrictions in the air decrease after you breach a certain altitude, but there is a barrier in place. You can only search for other worlds if you break through that barrier. I don’t know if I can accomplish that in my lifetime, but I do wish to try. Perhaps, that barrier is what the God Realm has restricted our world with. If I can break through that barrier, perhaps I will have a chance to enter the God Realm. I can almost feel that the God Realm is likely to exist on another star, perhaps one that exists above and superior to us. That place can master more powers and mystical things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why didn’t you try?” Huo Yuhao asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian shook his head and replied, “I can’t. Life and death are terrifying things, but death is nothing to me. However, I’m not just living for myself. I have to protect the Great Star Dou Forest, and I have to protect the dragons’ last pure bloodlines. Therefore, I cannot take that risk because I have to stay alive. Even if I have to stay alive, alone and lonely.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Frankly speaking, your appearance has given me a pleasant surprise. I have seen what other humans do not have on you, and there hasn’t been anyone across tens of thousands of years who has been able to break through into the God Realm by relying on his own strength, and to ultimately obtain the God Realm’s approval. And you finally have this opportunity. If not for the fact that you carry the Great Star Dou Forest’s destiny, I would almost be willing to help you, in the hopes that you can return in the future and tell me what you’ve seen on the other side. That would be most meaningful for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Unfortunately, you have fused with the Three-Eyed Golden Lion, and this means that we can only be on opposite ends. I will not kill you, and if I can defeat you today, I will seal you away and keep you in the Great Star Dou Forest. With your current cultivation rank and physical strength, you will have no problem surviving for a thousand years. Furthermore, I will use the Lake of Life’s water to nourish your body, and find some way for you to reproduce. Then, I will use your descendants to pass on the power of destiny.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will find a hundred thousand year soul beast to be your wife, so that your descendants will possess a soul beast’s characteristics, and your descendants can live even longer, while your power of destiny will always be passed on to your descendants. I will kill you when that happens, and I will fuse your Skull of Destiny into your descendants who possess a soul beast’s characteristics. His long life and fusion with the power of destiny will undoubtedly guarantee the Great Star Dou Forest’s peace and safety. I’ve contemplated this for a long time, and I feel that dealing with this in this fashion will achieve the best result.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian was speaking very seriously, like he had already dealt with this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression didn’t change, and he listened quietly to Di Tian’s speech.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The stronger you become, the lonelier you get. The Beast God is living an unhappy life after all, and he can’t even pursue the things he wishes to. However, I have a lot of respect for you. You hold onto this life because you’re bound by duty, and that is enough to earn my respect.” Huo Yuhao bowed faintly in Di Tian’s direction as he spoke to show his respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gradually straightened his body after his bow, and his eyes began to change along with his posture. His calm eyes suddenly grew bright, and they were filled with incredibly sharp luster. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But everything you’ve planned is based on a single prerequisite: you have to defeat me!” Huo Yuhao’s voice travelled far into the distance, and those soundwaves tore a gap through the dark clouds. Radiant sunlight shone upon the great earth once more, and onto Huo Yuhao’s body such that his entire frame turned golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian nodded and answered, “Yes, I have to defeat you. Then, let’s begin.” Di Tian slowly raised his right hand as he spoke and pointed his palm in Huo Yuaho’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao made the same action and raised his right hand. He radiated with incredibly strong light at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A golden sun glowed from behind his back, and this sun’s light was so intense that it surpassed the sunlight from the sky. The golden backdrop made Huo Yuhao seem like a God descending from the heavens.</span></p>
