 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You were extroverted, handsome, and loved to show off. I fell in love with everything about you. Mu En was also great, but he was too much like a stone. He’s not my type at all. Hence, you were the one who I had loved all this while.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, I could not choose you. Zhongli Wu’s father would never allow me to choose you because you were not a member of Shrek Academy. This was exactly why I was forced by him to choose Mu En instead of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing what Ye Xishui had said, his mind turned completely blank. He had not expected the biggest misery in his life to have originated like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui was still smiling, even though tears were streaming down her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Afterward, we met again. It was during that time when I was tasked by Zhongli Wu’s father to separate you. He told me how dangerous it was for the Holy Ghost Church to be up against two of the most gifted soul masters of my generation. Hence, I had to turn you against each other. That was the only way we could stop both of you from affecting the development of the Holy Ghost Church.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hence, I proposed that plan and used my body to bait you. After giving you my first time, I created a painful conflict for the three of us. However, only both of you were truly in pain. I had always known what I was doing. I was the Sacred Lady of the Holy Ghost Church! Hahaha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Y-You…” Long Xiaoyao pointed at Ye Xishui as he spat out blood from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui stared at him gently and said, “Xiaoyao, please don’t be angry. You will only die too quickly for me to finish what I have to say. Perhaps you will be less angry after you have heard what I have to say.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After what happened then, I left. However, I did not regret what I had done. I had given my body to the person whom I truly loved. I knew that both you and Mu En would have to live a life of misery after that. However, I had no choice. Do you know that Zhongli Wu’s father would have to kill both of you if my plan had failed? Compared to watching him kill both of you, I would rather watch both of you suffer in misery! After all, you are my love, and Mu En was a big brother whom I looked up to! How could I not know how nice he was to me? Both of you have always been incredibly important in my heart. Hence, I needed to do that to protect both of you from the Holy Ghost Church.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And I succeeded. Both of you ended up becoming Ultimate Douluo. Even though both of you were in pain and misery, we were at the very least still alive. Isn’t that right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After a few decades, Zhongli Wu’s father forced me to bear him a son before he died. He told me how that was the only way he could hand over leadership over to me without any worries. &nbsp;Following which, he helped me become an Ultimate Douluo. That was when I completely became the enemy of Shrek Academy. As the Sacred Lady of the Holy Ghost Church, I could never really be with either of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know how much I wanted to be with you that time we met after Zhongli Wu’s father died? However, I knew I could not. The reason is that I was already the Leader of the Holy Ghost Church. As the leader among all evil soul masters, I would ruin your reputation if I were to get together with you. I could only force you to follow me and protect me. This would allow you to continue to be regarded as the Dragon Emperor Douluo, instead of a member of the Holy Ghost Church.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am so happy that you have continued to follow me and protect me even after a hundred years. I might be an immoral and evil soul master, but I am still human. Do you really think I cannot see the feelings you have for me? However, I didn’t dare to get together with you. I couldn’t bear to see your name destroyed because of me. Hence, I could not let you know about the love I have for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now, I can finally exclaim my love for you. Xiaoyao, I have always loved you and you alone. Even though you have followed me and suffered because of me for more than a hundred years, I must tell you that I am definitely deserving of your love. The reason is that I have borne a son for you. Do you know that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“W-What did you say?” Long Xiaoyao’s jaw dropped after hearing what Ye Xishui had said. His body began to tremble.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A son? Xishui has borne a son for me?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it had already been more than a hundred years. Even if he was a powerful soul master, he would have probably died after a hundred years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You probably did not expect that. I knew you would have been very shocked after hearing what I had to say. To be honest, just like you, I have not seen him for more than a hundred years. I don’t even know if he’s still alive. I can’t go and see him, because I can’t bear to let him know that his mother is an evil soul master, and the Leader of the Holy Ghost Church. I only wish for him to lead a healthy life and be a normal human being. In fact, I don’t even want him to be a soul master. Hence, I gave him the surname of Yan—my surname before I joined the Holy Ghost Church.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, fate works in mysterious ways. Our grandson was actually able to get into Shrek Academy by his own merit. He eventually became a disciple of Mu En. If I had not known that his martial soul was the same as my second martial soul—the Radiant Phoenix, I would not have known that Mu En had accepted our grandchild as his disciple. In fact, Mu En did his best to nurture him, and he ended up as the Dean of the Martial Soul Department.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?!” Both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong could not help but express their disbelief. If not for Ye Xishui’s confession today, who would have known that Yan Shaozhe was actually Long Xiaoyao’s and Ye Xishui’s grandson?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re lying. You’re trying to sow discord among the people within the Academy!” Tang Wutong exclaimed in rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui smiled as she looked at Long Xiaoyao, who had already been stunned by everything she had said. “Is there a need for me to sow discord when things have already come to this stage? Besides, as an Ultimate Douluo, do you think I have to go around and spoil relationships? I am who I am. I say what I say. Of course, I will not go around spreading lies. Shaozhe should be our grandchild or great-grandchild, judging from his age. However, I have never tried to contact him. I have only gone to check on his bloodline and confirm that he is our descendant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pulled Tang Wutong back and shook his head. Tang Wutong simply could not believe what she was hearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao frowned as he looked at Ye Xishui. “Is this all real? I really can’t believe it. Why? Why didn’t you tell me all of this earlier?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui spoke plainly, “This is because I was the Sacred Lady of the Holy Ghost Church! I was the Leader of the Holy Ghost Church! I am the Supreme Leader of the Holy Ghost Church! What could I have told you? I have already done so many immoral and inhuman things. I have the blood of hundreds of thousands of lives on my hands. What would have changed if I told you all of this? So that you would fall deeper in love with me? So that you would become an evil soul master? So that we would drag all of our descendants into the Holy Ghost Church? No. I could not have said all of this to you. In fact, I can’t even share them with anyone else. I could only bury all of it in my heart. I can only dream of the momentary sweet moments I had in my dreams. These sweet memories are what prevent me from becoming the true destroyer of the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Look at this!” Ye Xishui raised her arms as a gentle golden flame rose around her body. “This is my real trump card. No one would have expected an evil soul master with the Blood Soul Demonpuppet to possess a second martial soul. Even Zhongli Wu’s father didn’t know that I had this martial soul. I did my best to hide it from everyone. The people from the Holy Ghost Church would definitely kill me if they knew I had this martial soul. Hence, I have hidden it for close to two hundred years. I had not expected it to be useful today. By using the phoenix’s ability to rise from the ashes, I was able to save both of our lives.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao shook his head and said, “I should not have entered. If it was just you alone, you might have been able to survive. You would not have had to ignite your life energy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui shook her head and said, “No, if you hadn’t entered, I would really have died. My heart would have died. I really wanted you to come in. The only reason why I chose to enter the trap willingly is that I had already become tired of this world. I needed to find a place where I could truly belong. I had planned all of this carefully. Do you think that Xu Tianran can actually trick me? Do you think his trap would have been successful if I hadn’t entered willingly? I was using this last chance to see if you still loved me, just like a hundred years go. I am so glad I was right. Xiaoyao, thank you for not disappointing me. I am really, really happy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s breathing was becoming more pained as he stared at Ye Xishui. However, he remained silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui lifted her hand and stroked his face gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong? Why are you keeping quiet?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have made my life so miserable with all your lies!” Long Xiaoyao looked up into the sky and bellowed. At that instant, tears streamed from his old eyes. He would never have expected his struggles to be so meaningless. He did not know that he was bearing responsibility for a crime he had never committed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, he did not feel relieved or happy. He just felt as though he was empty. That sensation was a lot more painful than what he had gone through before.</span></p>
