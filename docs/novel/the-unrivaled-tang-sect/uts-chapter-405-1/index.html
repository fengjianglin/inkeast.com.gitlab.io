 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

At the same time, he retracted some of the suppression that he had forced on Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt more relaxed at this point. Even though he had made a good start, he didn’t dare to slack off. He was clearly aware that the Beast God might erupt any time if he said or did anything wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things were also very quiet down below. Elder Xuan, Elder Mu and the other strong individuals from Shrek were watching tensely. Di Tian’s sudden silence left them slightly weirded out, but they didn’t make any moves, seeing that the Beast God hadn’t killed Huo Yuhao yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Body Douluo Du Busi had already crawled back to his feet. He looked very miserable right now, not expecting the Beast God to be so strong. When Di Tian unleashed his full strength, Du Busi had felt that he was completely irresistible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The teachers from Shrek Academy were quickly organizing the students, while the Shrek City Defense Army meditated and rested. No one knew what was going to happen next, but every bit of soul power they recovered would earn Shrek an extra glimmer of hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A streak of white light shone from Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny. In the next moment, a petite figure appeared in front of Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a young lady who looked to be around fourteen or fifteen years old. Her dress was a spotless white as it swayed in the wind. Her genie-like deep blue eyes oozed a boundless, chilly intent, but there seemed to be a lack of quick-wittedness within them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is…” Even though Di Tian was experienced and knowledgeable, he was still stunned when he saw the Snow Lady. After all, she was released from Huo Yuhao’s eyes! Furthermore, he could tell that this wasn’t some sort of soul skill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s martial soul had been switched. One red and four orange-gold soul rings slowly rose around him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he looked at the different glows that came from his soul rings before looking at the Snow Lady in front of him again, Di Tian’s golden eyes revealed a confused look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am a different soul master. I possess twin martial souls, and this is my second martial soul, the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion.” Huo Yuhao could also make the Ice Empress and Skydream Iceworm appear, but he didn’t do so. When he had faced Di Tian earlier, he could sense the Skydream Iceworm’s hatred towards him. It was unforgettable! Undoubtedly, Di Tian was the mastermind who had forcefully tried to snatch the Skydream Iceworm’s million-year accumulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Ice Empress, Huo Yuhao wanted to hide her existence, because the Ice Empress was conscious. If he revealed anything suspicious, things might turn counter-productive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian nodded as he sensed the aura of Ultimate Ice coming from Huo Yuhao’s body, “It’s indeed the aura of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion. You are indeed blessed by Ultimate Ice. Is this the Icesky Snow Lady? Can your soul ring produce a summoning-type soul skill?” After finishing this last sentence, he also became a little uncertain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “From the colors of my soul rings, you can tell that this isn’t a simple soul skill. Can’t you tell who she is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a thought from Huo Yuhao, the Snow Lady moved. She lifted her right hand, and a streak of deep-blue sword light shot out like a bolt of lightning towards Di Tian’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the sinister chill approached, Di Tian’s eyes shone with golden light before the sword light was crushed. However, he immediately opened his eyes wide as he realized that it was a familiar chilly intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is this, is this the Snow Empress’ Unparalleled Chill? You, you are the Icesky Snow Lady?” Di Tian couldn’t help but exclaim as he looked at the Snow Lady in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady drifted in the air, but she didn’t move from her position. She naturally wouldn’t react to Di Tian’s question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian’s gaze quickly shifted to Huo Yuhao’s body, and it turned sharp. “How is this possible? Why is the Icesky Snow Lady in your body? What is the relationship between you? She seems to be unaware?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded gently. “The Snow Empress’ situation represents hope for the future between humans and soul beasts. I met her at…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao started to recount how he had first encountered the Snow Empress’ embryo, and transformed the Snow Empress into a Spirit. He didn’t even conceal the truth about Electrolux’s existence. He even went so far as to talk about his spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t easy to earn the Beast God’s trust. Huo Yuhao had no choice but to do this. Di Tian would have certainly sensed the presence of the undead army earlier. He needed to prove that everything he said was true beyond the shadow of a doubt. Without his spectral demiplane, he couldn’t have summoned an &nbsp;army of a hundred thousand undead, given that he was only a Soul Sage. He only hid the existence of the Ice Empress and Skydream Iceworm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian listened silently to Huo Yuhao’s story, but his emotions were undulating throughout. However, he hid them very well, and Huo Yuhao couldn’t tell anything from his emotions or the look in his eyes. What Huo Yuhao was certain about was that the Beast God heeded his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, you still failed in the end. The Snow Empress lost her spirit and her awareness. How can this Spirit that you talk about be considered a success?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao calmly replied, “Yes! You are right. I can’t guarantee that the conversion into a Spirit can be successful. However, how can we determine the success of this experiment just through one try? We can only ascertain the possibility of success with more attempts. However, at least we’ve found a new route that we can take!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Snow Empress gave me four soul rings. I didn’t kill any soul beasts for these four soul rings. They were willingly offered to me by the Snow Empress. In addition, the existence of my Spirit is more beneficial to me than having soul rings. This is what I mean when I said that a problem of interest can only be resolved with interest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If a soul master can obtain a Spirit, he won’t need a soul ring at that particular rank. In addition, it’s even more beneficial for him. Don’t you think he’ll agree to this arrangement?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At the same time, a Spirit can bring more than just one soul ring to a soul master, and it can even be controlled by a human and a soul beast together. A soul master might pursue a higher-tier soul ring, but what about soul engineers? Furthermore, if a top-tier soul beast is used to fuse with a soul master to create a Spirit, and this soul beast is compatible with me, why wouldn’t I be willing to obtain more soul rings from it? These are what we have been researching. It’s a pity that we can’t complete this research by ourselves. The reason is very simple: we find it very difficult to find soul beasts that are on the verge of death, and are willing to trust us!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To a certain extent, the Snow Empress’ Spirit failed because the Snow Empress’ embryo was stuck in a special situation, in which it was on the verge of exploding. At that time, it was already difficult for us to ensure that she wouldn’t die. However, I’m confident of succeeding if we establish a pact. This is why I hope to receive the help of soul beasts for my future research in this aspect. If you’re willing to personally find a few soul beasts who are in this state to fuse with a few of our human soul masters that have reached their bottlenecks, you can help to prolong the lives of those soul beasts. Even though they might only be able to survive for another hundred years by following a human soul master or soul engineer, they’ll at least be able to experience this world in a different way. Their lives can be extended for a slightly longer period of time, which should be better than just dying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If this research is successful, soul masters will have more choices in the future. Every soul master can even wait until their soul power accumulates to a sufficient standard before fusing with a Spirit. I even hope that if Spirits can provide enough soul rings for us, we can let these Spirits leave these soul rings behind of their own accord. When soul masters and soul engineers need them at some stage, they can actively fuse with these soul rings. In this way, humans and soul beasts might not remain enemies in the future, but friends that rely on each other. I’d be satisfied if we could achieve such a result.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t continue speaking. He knew that his ideals were slightly contradictory to those of both soul beasts and humans. The Beast God needed time to think and understand his intentions. He stopped talking and waited quietly. When he flew up from the southern city wall today, he had already disregarded his own life. No matter what others thought, he believed that he was the one who had brought this calamity to the Great Star Dou Forest. If he couldn’t stop this calamity, he was willing to die for Shrek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao, who was much calmer than he had been in the past, had another thought. The greatest barrier to the research on Spirits was what he mentioned earlier; there weren’t enough dying soul beasts that were willing to cooperate. If he could convince the Beast God, it would be extremely beneficial to his research on Spirits!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian remained silent for a while. After some time, he slowly lifted his head. “I’ve never heard of the things you’ve mentioned to me. I don’t know if you’re trying to trick me. However, I can tell you that I’ll risk everything to destroy Shrek City if you are lying to me. This time, we’ve indeed suffered great losses. However, Shrek City will no longer have the protection of the Golden Tree if there’s a next time. Are you willing to follow me into the Great Star Dou Forest to attempt your research? You need to prove your words with actions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m willing.” Huo Yuhao replied without any hesitation.</span></p>
