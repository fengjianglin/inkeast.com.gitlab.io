 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was one of the evil soul masters who went after the Beast God with Zhongli Wu. That endeavor could be considered a huge failure, especially with the number of casualties they had sustained. However, he was the only one who managed to emerge unscathed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Similar to Di Tian, he also possessed dark-type power. When they were going after the Beast God, he was able to develop a much deeper understanding of dark-type powers by sensing Di Tian’s aura, as well as observing how he controlled his dark-type power. After returning from the hunt, he not only did not sustain any injuries, but also improved his soul power, and had become a Transcendent Douluo. He managed to make a breakthrough past a bottleneck which had restricted his development for several years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Huo Yuhao was actually facing an evil soul master who was a Transcendent Douluo for his first battle. On top of that, the evil soul master specialized in dark-type power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark clouds that hung over the sky rolled towards Huo Yuhao and instantly enveloped his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After reaching the rank of Titled Douluo, the execution of soul skills was no longer the sole deciding factor in battles. Aura, soul skills, self-created soul skills, and identifying weaknesses were all important factors which could decide the outcome of a battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stood there without moving the whole time. He could definitely feel the immense pressure exerted on him by his opponent. In fact, this pressure felt strangely familiar. This was because the Beast God was the last person to exert that much pressure on him, and helped unlock his potential!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though this evil soul master was also skilled in dark-type power, he was a long way from matching Di Tian’s powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark-type powers…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao revealed a faint smile as the visor of his Icy War God’s Armor descended over his face. His entire body was now fully enveloped by his armor. Following which, the Icy War God’s Armor emanated a familiar dark blue light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Icy War God’s Armor was not just any armor. It was a human-shaped tool which was controlled not by Huo Yuhao’s body, but by his invincible spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Xuan Ziwen was making the Icy War God’s Armor, he had considered Huo Yuhao’s impossibly strong aptitude in spiritual power, and hence adjusted the armor such that it demanded an unbelievably huge amount of spiritual power from its user. Hence, a normal human being would never be able to activate the Icy War God’s Armor. Once he or she managed to activate it, the person would find his or her spiritual power emptied by the armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire Icy War God’s Armor was controlled by one’s intent. Because of how the dark clouds had completely enveloped Huo Yuhao, he was no longer able to see anything in the dark. Even his powerful Spiritual Detection seemed to have been trapped in a marshy swamp of darkness. Formless pressure was surging towards him from all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, would this power be sufficient to restrict Huo Yuhao?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Spiritual Blast!” Huo Yuhao enunciated those words slowly. Even though he did not shout them, the two thousand powerful spectators around him could hear his words audibly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, everyone present felt as though their spiritual power had been influenced by Huo Yuhao’s attack. Even the dark clouds that had enshrouded Huo Yuhao started to surge violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An intense vibration started to travel through the dark-type clouds as Wu Yun started to feel a mystical energy coming into contact with the soul power he had released into those clouds. Even though his soul power was not directly affected by this mystical energy, the spiritual power he had used to control his soul power was being disintegrated by the mysterious energy. The clouds which had broken free from his control started to rise back into the sky. This strange sight resembled the mushroom clouds which usually formed after huge explosions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A figure instantly flickered from within the mushroom cloud into the sky as the dark blue light on his body gave away his identity. Yes, he was none other than Huo Yuhao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After ascending into the sky, Huo Yuhao, who was wearing his Icy War God’s Armor, seemed like a God who was about to descend to the land of mortals. His gaze was already locked onto Wu Yun, who was now enveloped by the dark clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A transparent crystal at the forehead of the Icy War God’s Armor suddenly cracked. Following which, a streak of purple-golden light was emitted as a mystical sight formed before everyone’s eyes. Initially, the streak of light was purple-gold when it was just emitted. However, it gradually turned rose gold in the air. Then, when it penetrated into the dark clouds, it mysteriously changed into a pure golden color. A streak of light was somehow able to change colors three times in the air. How mystical was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A loud grunt could be heard as the dark clouds started to tremble violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, a streak of dark blue light tore across the sky as it surged into them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark clouds seemed to be melting like snow the moment they came into contact with the dark blue light as they disintegrated into fine black smoke that scattered everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yun’s figure was revealed. He was currently rapidly retreating as he started to show signs of panic. A pair of black wings had formed behind his back. However, the wings were not part of a flying-type soul tool. They were given to him by his martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His martial soul was the Darkness Crow. It was dark-type martial soul, which was extremely rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wings behind Wu Yun’s back seemed to be alive as the feathers on them emitted black lasers that intertwined to form a net in front of him. They were trying to block the streak of dark blue light that was going straight for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unparalleled Chill, Empress’ Sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dak blue light just straight through the net. Even though the net did not break apart, its original black color turned dark blue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A figure silently appeared at the tip of the dark blue sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had disappeared from the sky, and had seemed to use the sword light as a bridge to appear in front of Wu Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yun’s movements seemed to be very messy. It was apparent that he had been affected by the blow landed on him by Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny. However, he was still able to retaliate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two yellow, two purple, and five black rings on his body gave him the confidence that he could still retaliate against Huo Yuhao. His sixth ring, which was black, suddenly expanded as his entire body suddenly became illusory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His sixth soul skill, Darkening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though his consciousness had been a bit blurred by Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock, he was still able to activate his abilities. Darkening would allow him to negate seventy percent of all physical attacks and soul power attacks instantly. However, it would also mean that he would not be able to attack in that short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yun needed the five seconds of buffer time to shake off the effects of Huo Yuhao’s previous Spiritual Shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao did not attack him at the first instant possible. Instead, he exclaimed a single word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Explode!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A light flickered within the Eye of Destiny on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, Wu Yun’s entire body started to tremble intensely. His body, which had just started to undergo Darkening, was somehow returned to its original state under the effects of the mystical Spiritual Blast. On top of that, a black figure also exploded out from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing this, even Zhongli Wu could not help but gasp in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this spirit detachment? When did Huo Yuhao launch another spiritual attack on Wu Yun?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao naturally did not launch a second spiritual attack. He had only released his Spiritual Shock once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though it was just a single attack, the power of a Spiritual Shock released with the Eye of Destiny must not be underestimated. Its power was fully released in a single instant only because Huo Yuhao had feared that Wu Yun had some alternative defensive means. He had only chosen to detonate the Spiritual Shock when Wu Yun was injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was undoubtedly the best time to detonate Spiritual Shock right now. Wu Yun was not a soul engineer, and hence did not possess any defensive soul tools which could block spiritual attacks. Even though he was already a Transcendent Douluo, he was facing Huo Yuhao, whose spiritual power was on par with an Ultimate Douluo’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yun’s body flew backward in an uncontrollable fashion. At that instant, all the characteristics of his martial soul that his body had adopted all vanished. The black image which had been ejected from his body was trying its best to return. However, why would Huo Yuhao give him a chance to do that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An image flickered as Huo Yuhao vanished once again. When he reappeared, he was at a position between Wu Yun and his spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao swung his left hand backward, while he threw his right hand forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mystical vortex suddenly appeared above Wu Yun’s spirit. The spirit, which was rapidly flying towards his body, suddenly stopped in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom!” A soft sound could be heard as Wu Yun’s body flew backward once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s attack on Wu Yun’s body did not seem to be particularly strong. After all, Wu Yun was already a Transcendent Douluo. His body was definitely stronger than any normal rare metal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yun’s body flew back by about fifty meters. Even though his spirit had been detached from his body, his body still possessed certain reflexes, which allowed him to slow himself down as he tried to regain his balance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without looking him in the eye, Huo Yuhao faced his spirit as a light flickered across his eyes. A streak of rose gold light suddenly shot out from Huo Yuhao’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was another Spiritual Shock!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom!” The spirit instantly disintegrated into countless grains of light, which started to surge back towards Wu Yun’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Huo Yuhao did not try to stop them from reuniting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirit of a Transcendent Douluo was already considered very stable. Even after striking it with two waves of Spiritual Shock, Wu Yun’s soul could still not be completely destroyed. Even so, his soul was definitely heavily damaged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his spirit fused back into his body, blood started to spurt from Wu Yun’s mouth and nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He immediately lifted his head, and the hood that had covered his head fell down. His fairly good-looking face was revealed to the spectators. Other than the fact that his face was a little pale, he looked no different from any normal human being.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he suddenly raised his hand and pointed at Huo Yuhao as though he wanted to say something. Nonetheless, he seemed to be unable to speak for some strange reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, a mystical vortex suddenly appeared behind Wu Yun. The vortex was a combination of blue and gold colors. The moment the vortex appeared, Wu Yun’s body immediately took on the same combination of colors as the vortex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boooommmm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yun’s body was instantly shattered and powderized. His already shattered soul was destroyed in this huge explosion. There was nothing left of it at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the start till the end of the battle, the entire process only took a short while. Wu Yun, the Transcendent Douluo who possessed the Darkness Crow martial soul, and the first evil soul master to represent the Sun Moon Empire, had fallen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A heavy silence fell upon everyone present as Huo Yuhao stood calmly where he was before turning around to face the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
