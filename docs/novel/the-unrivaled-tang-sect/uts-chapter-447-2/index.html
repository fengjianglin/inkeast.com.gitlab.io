Even though he tried his best to steer away from such thinking, he would be overwhelmed with fear every time he had such a thought.</span></p>

Don’t leave me alone in this world to suffer. Dong’er, I really miss you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tears flowed down the corners of his eyes.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao wasn’t even clear-headed right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The curtains to his tent were pulled open, and a tall and slender figure walked into his tent. As she heard Huo Yuhao’s groans, her body turned slightly stiff. After that, however, she continued to walk towards Huo Yuhao. Her movements were very slow, as if she found it difficult to walk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she suddenly picked up her pace as she came closer to Huo Yuhao’s bed. She quickly came to his side and sat down by his bedside.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao’s senses were normally very acute, but right now, he actually didn’t know that there was someone else in the tent. He continued to squirm and groan in pain. His face was very pale, and buckets of tears and sweat had already fused together as they flowed down his cheeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Delicate fingers gently caressed his forehead. The movement of the fingers seemed a little stiff and rigid.</span></p>

The fingers seemed to be trembling slightly, and there was a tinge of warmth from them. The lady in the tent was shuddering a little, and was also in a slight state of shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dong’er, don’t leave me.” Suddenly, Huo Yuhao reached out and grabbed her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was astonished, and wanted to retract her hand. However, his grip was very tight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t struggle, but she could sense that his hands were icy-cold. It was icy-cold to a terrifying point. It was as if he had lost all the warmth in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Don’t tell me that he’s always in such great pain after he uses his Haodong Palm?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was weird, but Huo Yuhao calmed down after grabbing her hand. He stopped shivering as much, but he was still mumbling to himself. However, his pain had evidently been reduced significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s really pitiful! I never thought one could turn out like this from loving someone too much. However, why did he turn his love into a skill? Why doesn’t he go and find his lover?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far outside the tent, there was a person squatting in a dark corner. This person watched as she walked into the tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A slight smile spread across his face. He slowly stood up. It seemed like he didn’t need to stand guard anymore. She didn’t come out, even after a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person walked out from the corner. Wasn’t he the Eternal Defense, Xu Sanshi?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was suffering from the backlash of his Haodong Palm, and his body was very weak. Xu Sanshi understood this the best. This was why he followed Huo Yuhao back and stood guard outside his tent as a means of protecting him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, that lady had been in the tent for a long time without leaving yet. It seemed like he didn’t need to carry on with his protection for the rest of the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He silently left without making a sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had calmed down. His breathing had become more rhythmic, and he was no longer shivering. At times, he would mumble to himself, but he was evidently in less pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He used both his hands to grab tightly onto her tender fingers. It was as if he were grabbing hold of some life-saving grass. He wouldn’t let go of her hands. Slowly, a satisfied grin surfaced on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had fallen asleep. Following this, moonlight shone in from outside the window. From where she was seated, she caught a view of his profile. She was only here because she was worried about him, and curious about his condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she discovered that she was unable to leave right now.</span></p>

He didn’t do anything else either. He only tightly grabbed hold of her hand and squirmed in place . He was falling deeper and deeper into his sleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is the generational talent that everyone is in awe of?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bitter look appeared across her face.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he’s actually this fragile behind the surface. It seems like he has given too much to attain whatever powers he has.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But why is he able to calm down after grabbing hold of my hand? Is it because he feels comforted?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She retrieved a handkerchief with her other hand and dabbed at the perspiration on his head. Even she didn’t know why she did something as intimate as his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He appeared evidently less tense after she wiped off his sweat. It was as if she possessed some kind of magical power that helped him to calm down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His hands started to regain some warmth, and he stopped holding on so tightly. His body also moved with greater ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She continued to wipe away his sweat. Slowly, she placed her handkerchief to one side, and started to gently caress his hair.</span></p>

The lines on his face are smooth, and his eyelashes are long. There’s some rosiness to his cheeks right now and the life energy that he’s exuding seems to be stronger than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unwittingly, she became a little dazed. Just as she was in a daze, he slowly weakened his grip on her hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh… I can finally leave.” She gently retracted her hand, which was already covered with sweat. However, she subconsciously clenched her fist, as if she wanted to preserve the warmth that she felt in her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After she retracted the hand that she had placed on his head, she silently stood up. He was still sleeping very calmly, and didn’t move at all.</span></p>
