If the strength of a Spirit can be sealed during the fusion process, a soul master can add another soul skill when he reaches the next bottleneck and undergo a second fusion. If this continues, a Spirit can add many soul skills to a soul master. Our hunting of soul beasts can naturally be greatly reduced like that. You’ve already proved that a soul master can obtain many soul rings from one Spirit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was in awe. Elder Xuan was indeed deserving of his title as the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion. He managed to point out a clear path for Huo Yuhao using simple words. Huo Yuhao was sorely lacking in terms of experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and replied, “I will do my best. In addition, I’m willing to contribute the Pact-Sealing Spell to the academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” As Huo Yuhao spoke, everyone was stunned. All the elders had a shocked look in their eyes. As they looked at each other, they could see the amazement in each other’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan had been ready to dismiss the meeting, but after hearing his words, he sat down again and said, “Yuhao, you have to think this over carefully.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan’s expression was very serious as he said this. All the elders focused their attention on Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied with a sincere look on his face. “Elder Xuan, elders, I’ve thought over this carefully. I’m an orphan with no family. Everything that I have now was given to me by the academy. I would not be where I am today if the academy didn’t nurture me. I received the best education and care here. It’s also here that I felt familial warmth. The results of the research will be very beneficial in settling the conflict between soul masters and soul beasts. If it really succeeds, it’ll definitely alleviate the dispute between us and soul beasts. How can I do this alone? I don’t only wish to offer the academy the Pact-Sealing Spell. I also hope that the academy can develop Spirits and make it a future developmental path for all soul masters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan said, “Yuhao, you have to understand that it’ll no longer be yours once you give it up. Furthermore, have you thought of how valuable it is? I can tell you that it’s priceless. The academy can complete it for you, but we can’t repay you for such valuable research. I’ll feel uncomfortable! You’ve already contributed countless valuable blueprints for soul tools to the academy. How can we still take something so valuable from you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and replied, “Elder Xuan, I don’t know what to say. However, I believe that it’s a good thing for the academy to control the method of developing Spirits. If it’s only in my hands, it might be a bad thing for me. That’s why I don’t just hope to give it to the academy. I further wish that the academy can announce it to the world in the near future. The research of Spirits will be completed by the academy, and not by me alone. I can avoid a lot of trouble this way! The Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament is about to begin in a few months. I’m going to compete in it with the team, and I’ll need to use my Spirit then. If any outsiders know that I control the sole method of their creation, it might be very dangerous for me. I still want to contribute more to the academy and the Tang Sect. I’m sure you and the other elders won’t watch as I put myself in a perilous spot, right? The academy can take this burden for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the elders started to smile as he sounded very relaxed with his words. However, they couldn’t hide their admiration for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Huo Yuhao had proposed to give the spell to the school, none of the elders had asked him to hand his research over. Why? It was too valuable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like Elder Xuan had mentioned, Spirits were priceless in the eyes of soul masters. With such a secret, Huo Yuhao could become a master of his time no matter where he went. Even though what he said was true, how difficult would it be to find a strong backer with such valuable research?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan looked at all the elders and asked, “What do all of you think? I can only say that the academy did nurture Yuhao, but the contributions that he has made to the academy have far superseded what the academy has given him. Right now, he still wants to offer such valuable research to the academy. Truthfully, I feel very pressured as the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion!” After he finished speaking, Elder Xuan also couldn’t help but smile. However, he seemed very comforted as he looked at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the elders were also silent at this point. For such valuable research, it was really too much to take it for nothing. However, what could the academy give Huo Yuhao? He didn’t lack for anything now, since he possessed an Ultimate martial soul and was an advanced-level soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao thought of something quickly and said, “Elder Xuan, we can do it this way. I’ll give this research to the academy, and I’ll give it directly to my benefactor, Teacher Mu En. I’ll represent Elder Mu as the previous Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion and pass this information down to the academy. Since teacher has already passed away, the academy should naturally inherit everything that he’s left behind. I’m sure this works, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan waved his hand and said, “Isn’t that just self-deceiving? Alright, you don’t have to say anything more. I’ll accept your gift on behalf of the academy. However, this research will always be recognized as yours inside the Library of the Sea God’s Pavilion even though we’ll claim it to be the academy’s research to the outside world. Furthermore, I’ll confirm you as the Heir to the Sea God’s Pavilion with my current identity as the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion. Does anyone have any objection?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was shocked. Heir to the Sea God’s Pavilion? This also meant that Huo Yuhao would succeed Elder Xuan when he left his position as the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion. The Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion held the highest authority in Shrek Academy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Xuan, you shouldn’t do this. I’m not qualified…” Huo Yuhao said anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Considering how old Elder Xuan was, he only had at most twenty years left as the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion. The person who was most likely to succeed his position as the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion was Yan Shaozhe. Yan Shaozhe was also more than a hundred years old. It was going to be Huo Yuhao’s turn a few decades after him. Huo Yuhao would only be fifty or sixty years old then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan smiled and answered, “Why would you not be qualified? Ask all the elders about your contributions to the academy and whether they think you’re qualified. I’m sure that no one around has contributed to the academy more than you. Even in terms of reward, you should be getting more than anyone. Furthermore, I haven’t told you one thing. When Elder Mu was still around, he already confirmed you as the Heir to the Sea God’s Pavilion. I didn’t announce it because you were still too young. However, you forced my hand this time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao subconsciously took a look at Zhang Lexuan. He had always thought that she would be the Heir to the Sea God’s Pavilion. She wasn’t recognized as the top talent in the inner courtyard for nothing. Although she had just passed thirty, she already had eight rings. She wasn’t far from a Titled Douluo either. Why were the internal courtyard students so submissive towards her? It wasn’t because she was pretty, but because she was truly capable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan smiled. “You don’t have to look at Lexuan. Lexuan will be nurtured as a substitute Heir to the Sea God’s Pavilion. While the position of the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion is very important, he doesn’t have the right to decide everything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan smiled at Huo Yuhao, but her expression didn’t seem to change at all. Huo Yuhao’s spiritual senses were very acute. He could sense that there was indeed no change in her emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does anyone have any objections?” Elder Xuan turned to the elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were none.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had already demonstrated his abilities in the Sea God’s Fate. As he teamed up with Wang Dong’er, they managed to suppress five inner courtyard students. Even though there was some kind of elemental suppression, the elders still recognized his abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Twin martial souls and an Ultimate martial soul. He was a true talent. He even treated the academy as his family and gave such an important research to the academy. Even the strict elders couldn’t find any fault with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan said, “Alright, since there are no alternative propositions, we shall vote. Those who agree with me, please raise your hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides Huo Yuhao, the rest of the Sea God’s Pavilion’s members raised their right hands. This meant that Elder Xuan’s proposition had their unanimous approval. From the start, Huo Yuhao wasn’t just a simple member of the Sea God’s Pavilion. Although his identity wasn’t announced outside of the Sea God’s Pavilion, his position in the academy was still enhanced significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan said, “Yuhao, you can pass your research to me directly after you record it. I’ll keep it in the Library of the Sea God’s Pavilion as a code-red secret document. Whoever wants to read it in the future must seek permission through a conference first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the elders agreed with Elder Xuan’s suggestion. This research was too important, while the Library of the Sea God’s Pavilion was the most tightly-guarded place in the academy. It was the most appropriate place to store the research.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded immediately and felt more relieved. He only had one feeling at this point – it was good to have a family. With the academy around, he wasn’t alone. He had been under alot of pressure because this research was too valuable! It was undoubtedly the best choice to pass it to the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dismissed.” Elder Xuan dismissed the conference.</span></p>
