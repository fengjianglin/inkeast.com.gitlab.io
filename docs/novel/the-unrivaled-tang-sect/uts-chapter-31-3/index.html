 <p><strong>Book 5: The Championship Fight</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 31.3:&nbsp;The Golden Path VS Netherworld White Tiger&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>Naturally, not all Evil Eyed White Tigers could fuse with a Netherworld Civet. However, since ancient times, there would always be a pair, or even two, appear within each generation. Furthermore, one of the most important prerequisites for a descendant to assume the position of the White Tiger Duke was for said descendant to successfully marry a woman from the Zhu Family. Currently, Dai Huabin was the only son of the White Tiger Duke’s first wife within his generation that could perform a martial soul fusion with a daughter of the Zhu Family.</p>
 <p>The fusion of the Evil Eyed White Tiger and Netherworld Civet would create the enormous, eight-meter long, two meter tall figure that had just appeared in the Assessment Arena. It was Dai Huabin and Zhu Lu’s fusion skill—the Netherworld White Tiger!</p>
 <p>The enormous white tiger appeared somewhat transparent, and gave off the impression that it was a completely illusory existence. However, Dai Huabin and Zhu Lu’s figures had already disappeared. The White Tiger’s huge body squatted slightly, then immediately used its terrifying speed to pounce towards Huo Yuhao’s trio, transparent ripples trailing behind it.</p>
 <p>As it leapt into the air, it raised its head haughtily. Its gaze that overlooked the entire world was filled with arrogance as it revealed its bearing as both the tyrant of the world, and the king among beasts.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Xiao, let’s begin!” Huo Yuhao shouted, turning around and spreading his arms towards Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>They hadn’t originally planned to go this far, as Huo Yuhao had been determined to wait patiently for the sake of his future. However, when their opponents had activated their fusion skill, they’d been left with no other choice. Huo Yuhao didn’t want to lose this match; he wanted to let his mother’s spirit in heaven see his diligence and strength, and let her see that he had a chance at avenging her.</p>
 <p>Dai Huabin and Zhu Lu had their last resort, so why couldn’t Huo Yuhao’s trio have one as well?</p>
 <p>Wang Dong had already spread his arms wide, and a strange light appeared in his eyes as he looked at Huo Yuhao. There was a gentle look in his eyes, yet it also seemed both encouraging and consoling. This strange light caused Huo Yuhao’s heart to beat fiercely, and his gaze to become even more determined. However, a faint smile also appeared on his face; a smile that only Wang Dong could see.</p>
 <p>Right. Just before the match started, they had tried activating their fusion skill, and had succeeded in doing so; they’d actually regained the ability to unleash their mysterious fusion skill after only three days.</p>
 <p>Up on the tall stage, the teachers were all holding their breaths. However, the most nervous person on-site was the referee; he was already prepared to intervene at any time.</p>
 <p>Aside from an extremely small number of teachers, an overwhelming majority of them had never expected a spectacular scene like this in a match between freshmen. A fusion skill—that was a martial soul fusion skill!</p>
 <p>The referee was already preparing to stop the Netherworld White Tiger. Although a fusion skill was extremely strong, the users were still far off from his cultivation rank. He was confident that he could save Huo Yuhao’s trio in the instant that the Netherworld White Tiger launched an attack. However, he hadn’t made a move due to Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s movements, as well as Xiao Xiao’s actions.</p>
 <p>A dark light simultaneously erupted from the three large cauldrons beside Xiao Xiao as they instantly shot towards the middle of the Assessment Arena. At the same time, both of her soul rings for her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron simultaneously lit up.</p>
 <p>Halos of black light emerged from Xiao Xiao’s body, but they didn’t simply stop like they had last time. Instead, they poured into the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldrons.</p>
 <p>The three cauldrons then fused into one, causing a violent boom to ring out. Following that, an enormous cauldron that was double the size of her normal fused cauldron filled the sky. There were strange runes faintly discernible on the surface of the enormous cauldron, which caused an indescribable pressure to surge forward from it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao’s face instantly paled, but she closed her eyes and pointed forward with her right hand. The enormous cauldron flickered, then immediately appeared in front of the Netherworld White Tiger, letting out an ear-deafening boom.</p>
 <p>“National Treasure, Cauldron’s Quaking Tremble.” This was Xiao Xiao’s most powerful control technique.</p>
 <p>This time, she didn’t attempt to use its suction ability. Xiao Xiao knew that her strongest skill—which was borne from the fusion between two of her soul skills—wouldn’t be able to stop the Netherworld White Tiger. She activated it as a single-use skill, allowing its power to explode outwards. Although its cost was high, to the point where her soul power was almost entirely drained in an instant, she wouldn’t suffer a backlash like she had previously.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao’s Cauldron’s Quaking Tremble violently distorted the air surrounding her to the point where even the naked eye could see it, and its tyrannical vibrations filled the ten-meter area surrounding it. Due to the accurate guidance of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection, it had been able to perfectly block the advance of the Netherworld White Tiger.</p>
 <p>After taking on the distorting ripples from Xiao Xiao’s skill, the enormous Netherworld White Tiger lit up with white light. After that, it turned sluggish for a brief moment. It had taken on the violent vibrations from Xiao Xiao’s skill, but its enormous body had barely been affected at all.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao’s face was filled with shock. She’d never expected the enormous White Tiger to only pause for a brief moment after taking on her Cauldron’s Quaking Tremble.</p>
 <p>However, an even more astonishing scene occurred in the next instant, as a strange golden column of light shot up from beside her. The only thing left in her eyes after seeing that enormous golden pillar was an image of resplendence—a resplendence that came from Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong!</p>
 <p>On one side was Huo Yuhao, whose eyes were releasing a pale golden light.</p>
 <p>On the other side was Wang Dong, whose dazzling wings were unfurled as he released his Radiant Butterfly Goddess.</p>
 <p>The instant they released their martial souls after hugging each other, the surrounding ten meter area instantly lit up. An unusual light then surged from their bodies.</p>
 <p>That light was very peculiar. It was a peculiar radiance that alternated between blue, purple, and gold. A dense, radiant aura served as the trunk of the light, but there were mysterious soul power undulations mixed within it as well.</p>
 <p>An enormous figure had appeared behind Wang Dong. It was a complete, magnificent figure of the Radiant Butterfly Goddess.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, an enormous yet illusory eye with a vertical pupil had appeared behind Huo Yuhao. This eye was pale gold, but there was a faint hint of purple within its pupil.</p>
 <p>The two enormous figures slowly approached each other in midair, and transformations began to occur as they got closer and closer to one another. The figure of Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eye gradually became even more arcane, and its entire body turned purplish-blue; the gold colour in it had completely vanishedw.</p>
 <p>As Wang Dong’s Radiant Butterfly Goddess approached Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eye, it violently combusted into a bluish-golden flame.</p>
 <p>The instant the Netherworld White Tiger neared them, the two enormous figures had already merged into a single entity above their heads.</p>
 <p>The instant that Xiao Xiao’s Cauldron’s Quaking Tremble unleashed its powerful restrictive abilities on the Netherworld White Tiger was also the instant that the combusting Radiant Butterfly Goddess spread its dazzling wings, slowly hugging the figure of the Spirit Eye.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, the figure of the Radiant Butterfly Goddess had vanished, leaving only the bluish-purple Spirit Eye, which released a brilliant ray of light.</p>
 <p>A dazzling bluish-golden flame instantly erupted from the figure of the Spirit Eye, then slowly descended towards the hugging figures of Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong, shielding them.</p>
 <p>The enormous Spirit Eye seemed extremely arcane, and it seemed as if there were a boundless world within it if one were to look at it carefully. Immediately afterwards, a terrifying tri-colored laser shot out from it.</p>
