 <p>Elder Mu revealed a look of disappointment on his face and said, “A person’s life is limited, even for Titled Douluo like us. I can feel that my time is coming. After I go, the academy will have to be supported by you and the various elders. Little Xuan, you’re too headstrong, and not composed enough. You must remain calm when you meet with something in the future and think of the academy.”</p>
 <p>Little Xuan was shocked and replied, “Elder Mu, you…”</p>
 <p>Elder Mu chuckled, “Don’t worry, I won’t die so soon. I must hang on for a few more years until these little fellows mature before I’m relieved enough to go.” As he spoke, his benevolent gaze landed on Huo Yuhao and the other two.</p>
 <p>“Huo Yuhao, come over here.” Elder Mu waved toward Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Huo Yuhao hurried towards Elder Mu and came to his side respectfully.</p>
 <p>Elder Mu smiled slightly and said, “Good kid, I’m pleased with your answer just now. You’re not old, but you’re very resilient. I was especially shocked by your development after you returned from the tournament. A soul master can be nurtured in all areas except attitude. You are good, very good.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao lowered his head and said, “Elder Mu, you overestimate me. I’m an orphan. I have no more kin since my mother passed away. I was only filled with hatred then. I met Teacher Xiao Ya and eldest senior in Star Dou Forest, and they sent me to Shrek Academy using the Tang Sect’s slot. I grew up with my mother in that freezing place since I was young. All I felt was humiliation and indifference. It was only after entering Shrek Academy that I feel a familial sense. The academy gave me warmth, fed and clothed me, and even educated me to become a soul master and a person. This is my family. Everything except family can change. I can do anything to protect and preserve the glory of my family.”</p>
 <p>His words were emotional. His eyes turned red as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan was a little shocked as he looked at him. Elder Mu grabbed onto Huo Yuhao’s right hand and said, “When I first saw you, I knew that you were a kid with a story. That’s because the expression in your eyes was different from most others. Your eyes might have been very clear, but they concealed your pain. Your pain has only disappeared recently. As you said, Shrek is your family. It’s also our family. I told Du Busi when I conversed with him earlier that you’re my disciple. He told me that he won’t target you as long as you’re in Shrek. I understood what he meant. When you graduate from Shrek, he may target you again.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was stunned. He didn’t expect that the Body Sect still hadn’t given up on him.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan couldn’t take it anymore. “Stupid kid, quickly acknowledge your teacher.”</p>
 <p>“Ah!” Huo Yuhao only reacted now. He knelt down immediately and bowed to Elder Mu respectfully. “Elder Mu, please accept me as your disciple.”</p>
 <p>Elder Mu laughed and said, “Good kid, stand up.” He grabbed Huo Yuhao’s right hand and pulled gently. A gentle strength was injected into Huo Yuhao’s body and lifted him up.</p>
 <p>Elder Mu was all smiles when he saw the sincere look in Huo Yuhao’s eyes. The more he looked, the more pleased he was.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t make the proposal to Huo Yuhao to become his disciple with his current status. He could only hint. Fortunately, Elder Xuan reminded Huo Yuhao from the side, so he didn’t miss out on such a great opportunity.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao tried to test the waters by asking, “Elder Mu, are you agreeable?”</p>
 <p>Elder Mu laughed. “Silly kid, it’s time for you to say it.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was delighted, and hurriedly said, “Teacher.” He wanted to kneel down again as he said it. But Elder Mu didn’t let him do so this time by using his gentle soul power to lift Huo Yuhao up.</p>
 <p>“You will be my closed door disciple from today onwards. I’m not very particular about the formalities. You don’t have to kneel in the future. A bow will do.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Huo Yuhao was still very respectful even though Elder Mu wasn’t very particular about formalities. If Elder Mu and Elder Xuan were not around, he would have jumped in excitement.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao were envious as they saw this scene, and walked up to congratulate him hurriedly.</p>
 <p>Elder Mu smiled. “The two of you are good too. Xiao Xiao, learn from Elder Xuan in the future. Let him analyze you – a special auxiliary-type battle soul master. As for Wang Dong, you’re a light-type soul master too. You can be my disciple in name temporarily.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong stuck out his tongue and said in a slightly brazen manner, “Elder Mu, this is unfair. I’m a light-type soul master just like you, but you accepted Huo Yuhao as your disciple although he isn’t the light-type. How can you be so discriminatory? I want to be your closed door disciple too.”</p>
 <p>Elder Mu couldn’t help but laugh as he saw Wang Dong’s indignant look. He said, “You little fellow! You’re the first person to make such a request in front of me. There can only be one closed door disciple.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong moved closer as he saw that Elder Mu wasn’t angry. He said almost naturally, “It’s okay! With your status, you can set a precedent! Who will dare to doubt you? Moreover, both Yuhao and I possess martial fusion soul skills, and are one together. Just take the both of us as the same person.”</p>
 <p>Elder Mu’s smile turned a little cheeky, “Oh? One together?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong blushed as he saw Elder Mu looking at him. He grabbed onto Elder Mu’s other hand and said, “Just accept me too. Otherwise, he will bully me in the future when he’s an official disciple but I’m just a disciple in name.”</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan was stunned as he saw this scene. In his memory, no one, including Yan Shaozhe, had ever dared to be so brazen in front of Elder Mu! But Wang Dong didn’t only just do this. He didn’t seem vexed as he looked at Elder Mu. On the other hand, he appeared delighted.</p>
 <p>Elder Mu smiled as he said, “Alright, alright. I can’t outtalk you. I shall accept you too.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was elated, and knelt down hurriedly before bowing to Elder Mu.</p>
 <p>Elder Mu lifted his left hand, and a wave of soul power dragged him up. Elder Mu said, “Little Xuan, did you see this? I was forced to accept two closed door disciples. Haha.”</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan chuckled and replied, “I see that you quite enjoy it. This is not bad either! Both these fellows are good. Since this is the case, I shall accept a closed door disciple myself too. I’m not much younger than you anyway!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao was quick-witted, and knelt down in front of Elder Xuan hurriedly. She bowed to him, “Teacher.”</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan lifted her up and chortled, “Little fellow, you must be outstanding when you’re under me. Don’t lose to those two fellows.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao laughed and replied, “Teacher, I will do my best. Just give me all the items that can enhance my strength.”</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan laughed, “Wow, did I accept a closed door disciple or a little troublemaker? You’re definitely not standing on ceremony!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao laughed, “We’re on the same side. What’s there to stand on ceremony between us, right? I bought you a chicken drumstick too.” After she ended her retreat, she had been cultivating with Elder Xuan, and was already very familiar with him. She was naturally extremely excited now that their relationship had been confirmed.</p>
 <p>Elder Mu revealed a stunned look on his face at this point and said, “Du Busi just left, but someone just came. It seems like it’s a good day today.”</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan squinted his eyes, and a sharp radiance flashed across them. He was about to make his move.</p>
 <p>Elder Mu lifted his hand and stopped him. He said, “The visitor is a guest. Just invite him in.”</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan was shocked and asked, “Into the Sea God’s Pavilion?”</p>
 <p>Elder Mu smiled and replied, “Yes, into the Sea God’s Pavilion.”</p>
 <p>Although Elder Xuan was shocked, he wouldn’t go against Elder Mu’s instructions. But he never recalled any outsiders being allowed into Sea God’s Pavilion before.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan had already disappeared from where he was as a radiance flashed. He arrived outside the Sea God’s Pavilion at the next moment. He looked into the distance and said coldly, “Since you’re already here, you don’t have to sneak around anymore. Come out.” As he spoke, he grabbed at the air, and a huge citrine hand appeared in the air. The hand opened wide and grabbed in one direction. Suddenly, countless thin black cracks appeared in air in that direction.</p>
 <p>Although these cracks couldn’t compare to Du Busi’s, they still existed.</p>
 <p>“Elder Xuan, this is not a way to receive your guest.” A dim golden radiance lit up. As a halo spread instantly, it rippled, and the distorted light rays canceled out Elder Xuan’s huge hand. A figure also appeared in that direction.</p>
 <p>The person that appeared wasn’t tall, but he was plump. His long, elegant robe was embroidered with gold patterns. He placed his hands behind his back and smiled at Elder Xuan. Wasn’t he the Hallmaster of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy’s Illustrious Virtue Hall, as well as the person in charge of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy?</p>
 <p>“It’s you? Jing Hongchen.” Elder Xuan was also shocked. Although he could sense his strong presence, he didn’t expect it to be the Hallmaster of the Illustrious Virtue Hall.</p>
 <p>Jing Hongchen smiled and said, “Elder Xuan, you shouldn’t be surprised. Since you want something from the Illustrious Virtue Hall, I’ve come to personally pay a visit to Elder Xuan and Shrek Academy.”</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan’s eyes flashed with a divine light as he thought to himself, “This Jing Hongchen came at such a coincidental timing! Did He come with the Body Sect, and only show himself at this point, or is it really a coincidence?”</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan didn’t reveal his thoughts, and spoke indifferently. “You’re a guest, please come in.” As he spoke, he turned around and walked into the Sea God’s Pavilion.</p>
