 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were already eight-ringed Soul Douluo, and improving one’s cultivation was an extremely slow and difficult affair once a soul master obtained their eighth soul ring. But they weren’t normal people, and their soul power possessed special characteristics that normal soul masters didn’t. In addition to the effects of their Haodong power, their cultivation speed was already faster than normal people. This time, they were overjoyed because their cultivation had directly improved by so much due to the Qiankun Fortune Pill’s effects. Huo Yuhao could faintly feel that if he and Tang Wutong took one entire pill each, they could possibly directly break through to become Titled Douluo. This pill’s effects were just too powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they were quickly jolted back to reality after feeling their improved cultivation ranks, and the reason was simple: the others’ situations were vastly different from theirs, and some were even in some trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong smiled at each other, and immediately felt the excessively dense medicinal aroma inside the conference hall as they subconsciously turned towards the other individuals beside them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their facial expressions changed a little with that glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek’s Seven Monsters were doing alright because their cultivation ranks were relatively higher. Even though their eyebrows were locked in a faint frown, they could still hold on, while the medicinal auras that they were emanating weren’t considered too dense. However, the others who had relatively lower cultivation ranks like Gao Dalou, Nan Qiuqiu, and Na Na were in trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden light on their bodies was the strongest, and golden light could even be faintly seen along their veins under their skin, while their bodies were trembling vigorously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All Tang Ya could do was worry as she looked on from the side. Her body was weak, and even though she still had her soul power, she couldn’t muster it at all because of those evil toxins. Furthermore, she didn’t even know how to deal with the situation at hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wutong, quick!” Huo Yuhao pulled Tang Wutong and arrived behind Gao Dalou in a flash. Gao Dalou’s cultivation was comparatively lower than the rest, and he was also a soul engineer, so his soul power was quite a far cry from the soul masters who had studied in Shrek Academy. The same was true for his bodily strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Qiankun Fortune Pill’s effects were just too strong. Gao Dalou didn’t have Haodong power, and the forceful medicinal effects wreaked havoc inside his body as they barged around hysterically. Even though they were refining and improving his passageways and increasing his soul power, the process was pummeling his body. His entire frame was swollen, like he was a bomb that could explode at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pulled Tang Wutong and arrived behind him swiftly. They reached out with one palm each and pressed them against his back, while they held each other’s hands at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Huo Yuhao had predicted, their Haodog power had a suppressive effect against the Qiankun Fortune Pill’s effects. Just like back when Huo Yuhao had first attempted to fuse his martial soul with Tang Wutong’s, this suppression was entirely hierarchical, like these forces and energies had their own ranks and hierarchy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The medicinal effects in Gao Dalou’s body immediately settled down after the Haodong power coursed through him, and he heaved a deep sigh of relief. Soul power flowed within his body as he swiftly absorbed the pill’s effects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, their Haodong power unwittingly absorbed some of the medicinal effects once it entered his body. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong didn’t want that to happen. Those bits and pieces that attached themselves to their Haodong power were parts that Gao Dalou couldn’t absorb at all. Differences in physiques also meant a world of difference in one’s ability to absorb natural treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Dalou’s situation stabilized after a few minutes. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong withdrew their palms as they arrived behind Na Na.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Na Na was already a Soul Emperor, but she also started off as a soul engineer, and she was just a close-combat soul engineer. In addition to her martial soul’s special characteristics, her body was relatively weaker. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong used the same method to help her stabilize her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them then judged according to how quickly their companions were absorbing the pill’s effects and their respective situations, and helped them resolve their problems accordingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The difference in everyone’s cultivations could be seen from how they were absorbing the pill’s effects. In the end, the other five who were part of Shrek’s Seven Monsters, Xuan Ziwen, and Ji Juechen didn’t need Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s help, as they completed the absorption by themselves. They helped everyone else to varying extents, and Ye Guyi was the best off among those who required help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a saying that kindness would always be rewarded. In the process of going to everyone’s aid, those leftover medicinal effects that everyone couldn’t absorb naturally entered Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s bodies. When everyone’s situations were stabilized, their cultivation ranks broke through to Rank 85 at almost the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao waved his right hand and released a layer of spiritual power as they separated the conference hall from the outside world, and the medicine’s fragrance permeated the air. This fragrance was also beneficial, and everyone could absorb some of its effects as they cultivated. They couldn’t afford to waste the Qiankun Fortune Pill’s effects, not even a little bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao directed the entire situation as he quietly observed Tang Ya.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya didn’t take the pill, but she had absorbed quite a bit of the pill’s aroma after all the time that had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao used Spiritual Detection, and observed that even though the Qiankun Fortune Pill’s medicinal aroma didn’t help her eliminate the toxins in her body, and neither could it awaken her martial soul’s power, it could refine and improve her body, and it strengthened her resistance and immune system.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, even though Tang Ya’s circumstance didn’t improve, the Qiankun Fortune Pill’s aroma slowed her deterioration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Simply put, the Qiankun Fortune Pill’s aroma strengthened Tang Ya’s physique, and caused her life energy to flow away at an even slower speed. In addition to the fact that the Life Guardian Blade was continuously supplying her with life energy, Tang Ya’s circumstances were already starting to change for the better. At least, her life would definitely be prolonged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was immediately elated with that discovery. In the end, Tang Ya hadn’t actually taken the pill yet. Of course, Huo Yuhao knew that she couldn’t directly take a single pill, as its effects were too strong, but that didn’t mean that she couldn’t take any at all. The effects would be the same as long as the pill was diluted like it was today before it was fed to her bit by bit! That way, her situation could first be stabilized so that they would have more time in the future to search for the Bluesilver Emperor so that her martial soul could be awakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh of relief with that judgment.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Teacher Xiao Ya’s problems are finally resolved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone who was absorbing the medicinal effects came to one after another with Huo Yuhao’s help. Those who had absorbed relatively less woke up earlier, and Gao Dalou was the first who recovered from his meditation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Dalou just bolted away after recovering. He had no choice but to run, as the Qiankun Fortune Pill’s effects forced out all the impurities in his body. He was covered with a layer of dirt and filth, and reeked terribly. He loved alcohol with his life, and his body wasn’t that strong in the first place. Even though he didn’t absorb much of the medicine’s effects this time, the improvements and ameliorations that he had experienced were the greatest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s circumstances weren’t that different from Gao Dalou, and they returned to their respective rooms after waking up one after another to clean themselves up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, and Ji Juechen were the last to wake up. They were even a little later than Xuan Ziwen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen didn’t say much after he woke up, but he gave Huo Yuhao a thumbs-up. His cultivation rank was the highest, and it didn’t seem like his body had improved much on the surface, as he had consumed many medicines in the past to refine and improve his body. However, he was clear that all the hidden problems in his body had been eliminated after consuming the Qiankun Fortune Pill, and his soul power was showing signs of improvement. This meant that if he worked hard to cultivate, he still had a chance to increase his soul power. That was absolutely an unexpected surprise!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, and Ji Juechen had the least impurities in their bodies. Even though their bodies were still a little sticky, they didn’t have to run away immediately after completing their absorption.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How do you feel, eldest senior brother?” Huo Yuhao asked Bei Bei concernedly. These three had completely absorbed the pill’s effects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei smiled faintly and said, “I feel fantastic.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi laughed heartily and said, “I don’t just feel fantastic. I feel like I’m on cloud nine! I can feel that my soul power has improved by five ranks, and I’m almost at the bottleneck to Rank 80. I suspect Bei Bei has experienced something similar.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded, confirming Xu Sanshi’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That isn’t the most important part. I can feel that my martial soul’s intrinsic quality has also improved, and my spirit has been nourished. My cultivation in the future should be much quicker and more efficient.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “If you’re reached the bottleneck at Rank 80, why don’t you guys try to add another Spirit? That should be fine, considering your spiritual power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi shook their heads at the same time. Bei Bei said, “We have a lot of chemistry with our Spirits, we don’t need another one. Furthermore, our Spirits have more abilities that they can bestow upon us, and that’s sufficient for us to increase our strength and abilities. When the time is right, we will naturally obtain our eighth soul rings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took a long breath. That was just the effects of a single Qiankun Fortune Pill! The entire group benefited from just a single pill. Xu Sanshi and Bei Bei had the highest cultivations among everyone else. Their soul power had increased by around five ranks, so how about their other companions who only had around six soul rings? Their cultivations had to increase by a lot more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was very happy. He hadn’t wasted his time over the past few months after all, as raising the Tang Sect’s overall strength was very important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eldest senior brother, when are you going to let Teacher Xiao Ya take the pill?” Huo Yuhao asked Bei Bei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei replied, “The Qiankun Fortune Pill’s medicinal effects are too strong. I don’t think Xiao Ya can take one by herself. Why don’t we do it like we have done today? We can divide the rest of the pills among everyone else.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “Any medicine is most effective when you first consume it. Teacher Xiao Ya’s situation is unique, and dilution is a must. Furthermore, she has to consume less every time than we did today, but she can do it continuously so that she can digest and absorb its effects. This time, I am confident of ensuring that Teacher Xiao Ya’s body won’t deteriorate any further.” With that, he told Bei Bei about what he had observed from Tang Ya’s body and his own judgment.</span></p>
