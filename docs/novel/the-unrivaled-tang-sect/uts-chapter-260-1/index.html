He could feel the love she had for him, she had become a lot gentler than before, and her love for him drove this personality change. Everything fell into his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could clearly remember that Wang Dong’er had shyly told him when she gave him the pouch that her first uncle had told her she could only give the pouch to him when she was completely sure that he was the one. This meant she was giving her entire life to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dong’er…” Tears trickled down Huo Yuhao’s cheeks. His eyes were full of the memories he had of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I miss you so much, Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er looked identical to Wang Dong’er, and she was standing right next to him. However, he felt as if Dong’er was so far away from him, as if she were on the other side of the world. He really wanted to take her into his embrace at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was stunned as she watched Huo Yuhao’s tears roll down his face. This wasn’t the first time she had seen him cry, but for some reason, she felt her heart grow cold this time.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s obvious that his tears aren’t flowing for me… is he thinking about her?</span></p>

But we look exactly the same! Why? Why is this happening?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao suppressed his emotions and wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes as he softly pulled away Wang Qiu’er’s arm that was holding on to his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re right, my chances of survival aren’t great.” Huo Yuhao began to speak, his expression once again calm and composed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was delighted. She was about to say something before Huo Yuhao turned towards the Delicate Silk Immortal and said, “You You, will I be able to leave this place in peace if I decide not to try?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You You said, “Yes. As long as you don’t touch anything else in this place, and you’re not afraid of the intense poisons outside, then you can leave as and when you want to.” There was no question that she had a lot of self-confidence in her speech. It was still hard to say exactly how many hidden dangers there were inside this valley. At the very least, You You was confident enough that she wasn’t afraid of Huo Yuhao bringing outsiders into the place. Perhaps there were more hundred-thousand year plant-type soul beasts in this place then everywhere else on the Continent combined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and told her, “Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned around and stared at Wang Qiu’er. Wang Qiu’er returned his gaze with a complicated expression in her eyes and said, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao nodded his head gently, but his eyes were still welling up with tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er took the initiative to grab his hand. Even though the Delicate Silk Immortal had said she wouldn’t stop them from leaving, there were still many other dangers in this place, and it was still a lot safer for them to maintain their martial soul fusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just when Wang Qiu’er began to infuse her soul power into Huo Yuhao, she realized that her soul power didn’t connect with his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Wang Qiu’er glanced at him in surprise. Huo Yuhao’s wrist suddenly flipped around at this moment, and he used the Tang Sect’s Arresting Technique to accurately pinch Wang Qiu’er’s carpal vein as he injected soul power into her. Wang Qiu’er immediately felt as if half her body had become extremely numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao then raised his right palm and sliced down onto her neck. Wang Qiu’er’s pretty eyes were fixed on Huo Yuhao with a look of incredulity, but her body still crumpled downwards like a rag doll. Not in her wildest dreams did she expect Huo Yuhao to attack her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pulled gently and supported her waist with his right hand as he carefully placed her flat on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was very apologetic as he said, “I’m sorry, Qiu’er. I know you won’t let me make this choice if I don’t do this to you. Yes, you’re right; it’s very likely that I will fail this test. However, if I don’t even have the courage to try it, I will be letting Dong’er down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His expression became extremely relaxed when he uttered the last few words. Huo Yuhao gazed into the horizon and said, “We are bound to do crazy things from time to time in our lives. Dong’er, my only hope is that I can see you again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whew… you’re such an idiot!” Skydream’s voice rang out in Huo Yuhao’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was momentarily stunned, and he frowned faintly as he replied, “Are you going to stop me too, brother Skydream? I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Skydream said plainly, “That’s enough, you don’t have to say anything more. Just do it. Why would I stop you? If the Ice Empress were the one that was injured, I wouldn’t cower away, either! Furthermore, you’re underestimating how strong your body is. Don’t forget that your body has absorbed Life Gold before, and you possess Ultimate Ice as well. You went through so much suffering when you fused with the Ice Empress back then, and the circumstances were so difficult, but you did it anyway. Your willpower is far superior to that of the average person, and I don’t believe you will die just from eating some herb.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “What if it’s poison?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Skydream grunted and said, “It’ll be perfect if it’s poison. Do you know the Delicate Silk Immortal’s identity? She’s so high up in the hierarchy that she can be considered above the other immortal-level herbs. I think most of the other plant-type soul beasts within the valley will listen to her command. I am also a soul beast, and I can feel that she doesn’t harbor any hostility against you. What’s more important is that the Delicate Silk Immortal possesses formidable resistance against poison. The reason why there aren’t any other plants growing around her is because she is the natural counter to all toxins. With her beside you, all you have to do is breathe vigorously even if you’ve been poisoned. It would be quite hard to die from it even if you wanted to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes grew a little slack. “Why didn’t you tell me that earlier? If I could have explained to that to her, then I wouldn’t have had to knock her unconscious. When she wakes up, I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Skydream’s tone was a little arrogant as he said, “I just woke up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, you win.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had been so sure he was going to die, but that negative thought was immediately converted into absolute confidence after he listened to Skydream’s consolations.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes! How can an herb kill me? I don’t believe that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s thoughts stopped here as he stepped before the Delicate Silk Immortal. He lowered his voice and said, “Please give me that herb. I am willing to undergo this assessment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe! That’s great! You’re so courageous. Let me think, what should I give you?” The Delicate Silk Immortal was clearly quite ecstatic, and her enormous pink blossom was tossing from side to side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao immediately became despondent.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s happening? Has she not decided upon the herb way before this? Why is she making an impromptu decision? This Delicate Silk Immortal is so eccentric…!</span></p>

She spoke with a scolding voice, “Don’t worry. I’ve been alive for far too long, so it’s normal that my memory isn’t fantastic. Let me take a look at you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A purple beam of light floated out from her stamen as she spoke and landed on Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao maintained his vigilance, but the Delicate Silk Immortal’s ability arrived with no warning, and he couldn’t detect anything with his Spiritual Detection, either. This meant the Delicate Silk Immortal was stronger than he was in every possible way, and if he wanted to stop it, he could only meet force with force, because he had no chance of avoiding it.</span></p>

The Delicate Silk Immortal withdrew it after a while and muttered to herself, “So, that’s the case. Let me give you this.”</span></p>

This purple beam fired into the distance, and reached one hundred meters across the valley before it landed in a patch of vegetation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The purple beam paused momentarily before it was withdrawn. Huo Yuhao had powerful eyes, and he could instantly tell that there was a single plant at the other end of it now.</span></p>

What was strange was that the plant had three snowy-white leaves in the center, and there were several drops of water in the middle of these leaves, as if they were the remnants of the morning’s dew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao knew nothing about this herb. He had no idea what it was, and the herb was quickly brought before him under the Delicate Silk Immortal’s guidance.</span></p>

This herb could be mortally dangerous to him, after all! Huo Yuhao’s eyes focused as he stared at the herb. “You You, how should I consume it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal answered, “First, let me ask you a question. You’ve come to the Icefire Yin Yang Well today, and no matter who told you about it, you must have a reason for being here. What are you doing here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao lowered his voice and said, “I’m here in search of a magical herb, called the Yearning Heartbroken Grass. I need it to save someone’s life.”</span></p>

I knew nobody would attempt to go through all those poison clouds for no reason at all. Lift your head and open your mouth.”</span></p>

It was impossible for him not to be hesitant about something that concerned his life or death. However, the thought that Dong’er could collapse in front of him and there would be nothing he could do about it flashed across his mind, and whatever hesitation he had before vanished into thin air. He gradually raised his head and opened his mouth, his eyes even more determined now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal controlled the herb and slowly brought it before Huo Yuhao. She tilted the plant, and the transparent dewdrop-like water droplets on its leaves immediately flowed into Huo Yuhao’s mouth.</span></p>

The plant became a pile of dust in no time, and all it left behind were a few seed-like pods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Purple light flashed, and these tiny seeds flew far away into the distance. Nobody knew what the Delicate Silk Immortal had in mind for them.</span></p>
