 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, those are times long gone, so let’s not talk about them anymore. Let’s go. Let me see what other unique and magical qualities your spiritual power possesses. Speaking of which, the Body Sect is also adept with using spiritual power, but there’s quite a gap when compared to you. Your spiritual power alone has the standard of a Titled Douluo, so you are absolutely worthy of participating in this operation with us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi’s cultivation and vision were incredible. Even though he only felt Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power for a brief moment, he could immediately make an accurate judgment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, let me lead the way.” Huo Yuhao pulled Tang Wutong as he spoke, and they rose into the air at the same time. They didn’t release their martial souls; they were just using soul power to channel the flying-type soul tool behind their backs. Wings stretched out behind them as they gradually hovered in midair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other fifteen Titled Douluo rose into the air one after another, but they experienced another strange scene as they flew into the sky. They realized to their surprise that, with Spiritual Detection, Huo Yuhao actually presented a flight course in their minds, and everyone’s flight course was different. These Titled Douluo flew according to the charted flight course, and immediately formed a circular formation in the sky as they enveloped Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong in the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Great multitasking,” Du Busi praised once more. He didn’t hide his admiration for Huo Yuhao at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded in his direction before he channeled his spiritual power once more, and passed precise forward paths to the Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone flew up at the same time, and they proceeded in the direction of the Sun Moon Empire’s under Huo Yuhao’s command.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The air contorted faintly just as they surged into the sky, and all seventeen people disappeared into the air just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was surprised yet again. The other Titled Douluo felt a flash in front of their eyes before everyone else disappeared around them. But strangely, through Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection, they could feel everyone’s precise locations in their minds. This also meant that what they could see with Spiritual Detection was vastly different from what they could see with their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is… mass concealment?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi attempted to use his spiritual power to sense the people around him, but the Body Douluo was truly astonished this time. The reason was because he realized that, even with his spiritual power, he had to unleash his spiritual power to the highest possible level if he wanted to sense the others’ locations. Afterwards, he still had to judge according to the exact locations that Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection provided before he could make out the details, and only then could he feel some faint spiritual undulations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for everyone else, which included the Heavenly Sun Douluo, they couldn’t feel anything at all. They felt like everyone had just vanished into thin air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo no longer underestimated Huo Yuhao at all. What he had accomplished right now was far more important and effective than any of the Titled Douluo were in this operation. With an ability that could conceal everyone from sight, they could reach the Sun Moon Empire without expending too much effort. Furthermore, once they completed their task, retreating would also be a lot easier. They would have a better guarantee of their safety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was the one who had suggested that Shrek Academy send Huo Yuhao on this operation, because he had the best understanding of his mighty reconnaissance, investigation, and concealment abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Titled Douluo were all full of praise for the White Tiger Duke’s decision in this moment. They no longer underestimated Huo Yuhao, were instead full of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their speed began to gradually increase under Huo Yuhao’s control, and they began to rise high into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone could feel that Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was stretching far into the distance. Nobody felt much in the beginning, but their expressions began to change when it reached more than three thousand meters into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before this, they had some doubts when the Body Douluo had remarked that Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power had reached a Titled Douluo’s standard, and they had thought Du Busi was exaggerating things. But now they began to understand that Du Busi wasn’t exaggerating at all. How could anyone sustain Spiritual Detection over such a large area without possessing strength of a Titled Douluo’s spiritual power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three thousand meters was just the beginning. Afterwards, Huo Yuhao reached four thousand meters, then five thousand, then six thousand. When Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection stretched all the way to ten thousand meters, the Body Douluo couldn’t help but blurt out, “Kid, your spiritual power has the standard of a Transcendent Douluo!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled faintly and replied, “You flatter me, sir. I’m just cutting some corners with my soul skill.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi chortled, but said nothing more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a soul skill, but it was a hundred thousand year soul skill! The higher Huo Yuhao’s cultivation was, the more he could feel and experience exactly how powerful the hundred thousand year soul skill that his brother Skydream had bestowed upon him all those years ago was. Those four hundred thousand year soul skills consolidated his Spirit Eyes’ foundations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was very modest, but nobody dared to underestimate him anymore. Titled Douluo could reach accurate conclusions from just a single glimpse, and even though they didn’t know how formidable his fighting strength was, they could be sure that this youngster’s potential in the future was boundless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection, which could reach an incredibly far distance, quickly began to have practical uses. Large masses of all kinds of surveillance soul tools had already appeared in his vision, and the Titled Douluo could sense them all through Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These surveillance soul tools covered between three thousand and five thousand meters of airspace, and it was an all-round detection with all kinds of surveillance soul tools. They covered almost all the space below five thousand meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The effect of Huo Yuhao taking the Titled Douluo further up was presented in this moment. They had no choice but to keep flying up, because unless they were higher in the sky, they couldn’t pass by all the dense and tight surveillance soul tools without being detected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Passing through the border was undoubtedly the most difficult part, and everyone understood that. They continued rising through the air under Huo Yuhao’s guidance with Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who could participate in this operation were the best of the best in the world of soul masters. There weren’t any who were at Rank 90; every single Titled Douluo was at least Rank 93. There were at least half who were also Transcendent Douluos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, going five thousand meters into the air didn’t trouble them at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Huo Yuhao wasn’t satisfied with just five thousand meters. He continued bringing everyone higher into the sky after reaching five thousand meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Any height above five thousand meters was practically forbidden to humans, and the further they went, the more gaps between their cultivation ranks began to show.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nothing much happened to the Transcendent Douluo, but those who weren’t yet Transcendent Douluo gradually began to slow down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what astonished them was that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, who were holding each other’s hands, didn’t decelerate due to the cold or because the air was thin. They seemed like their situation wasn’t that much different from the various Transcendent Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They surprised everyone yet again as they continued taking them up. Huo Yuhao stopped rising only when they reached over six thousand meters in the sky, and only then did he bring everyone towards the Sun Moon Empire’s territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was already a Class 9 soul engineer. He and Xuan Ziwen had conducted a series of research and experiments regarding all kinds of surveillance soul tools over the past two years, and therefore, he couldn’t be more familiar with these soul tools. High altitude aerial surveillance soul tools could only conduct surveillance downwards; only a very small minority could survey both up and down at the same time. This type was extremely dangerous for everyone here, so that was the reason why Huo Yuhao continued to go up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All soul tools would be much less effective above five thousand meters, and that was the same for high altitude aerial surveillance soul tools. Even though two years had gone by since then, these two years weren’t enough for surveillance soul tools to be advanced to another level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, two years later, according to Huo Yuhao’s accurate judgment with Spiritual Detection, all the surveillance soul tools, whether they were on the ground or in the sky, were insufficient to reach altitudes of more than six thousand meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As casual as the Transcendent Douluos were, they still aided the other Titled Douluo to rise to greater heights at the same time as they continued forward and flew towards the Sun Moon Empire’s territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Admiration was starting to appear in those Titled Doulou’s minds. The reconnaissance and concealment abilities that Huo Yuhao had displayed was just one part of it; the other was the absolute strength that the two of them were displaying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rank 93 Titled Douluo had a lot of trouble flying at six thousand meters, but Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong appeared extremely casual from the beginning to the end. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao was the main control-type soul master, and he was leading all the other Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was multitasking, yet he could maintain flight at such a high altitude so casually. That was sufficient to prove his and Tang Wutong’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, these Titled Douluo didn’t know that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had Class 9 flying-type soul tools behind their backs! This pair of flying-type soul tools allowed them to conserve soul power as much as possible, and allowed them to fly at extremely high altitudes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo was already filled with astonishment. He didn’t just stop underestimating Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, but he even treated them with caution and wariness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Typically, one had to be at least a Titled Douluo to fly at more than five thousand meters. Furthermore, going another thousand meters above five thousand was another challenge altogether. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong didn’t need anyone’s help to fly to six thousand meters, and even if their flying-type soul tools were special, that was sufficient to display their abilities. This meant they were at least Titled Douluo.</span></p>

The White Tiger Duke did say that they were around twenty years old. That’s just hard to imagine, and I can’t see them straight anymore. Shrek Academy has managed to nurture Titled Douluo who are only a little more than twenty. They have lived up to their name of being an academy of monsters!</span></p>
