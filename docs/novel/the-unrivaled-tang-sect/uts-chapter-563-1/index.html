 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dark Dragon’s Sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A purple light formed a powerful beam and slashed downwards. The sky was torn apart as every ounce of gravity was destroyed and ground into dust. The Godly Taotie Bull’s enormous body was somehow immobilized by the torn-up sky, as it found itself unable to dodge the sword. Following which, the frightening Dark Dragon’s Sword was about to reach the area between the Godly Taotie Bull’s horns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boooommm!” A deafening sound exploded in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two yellow glows, which were circulating around one another between Elder Xuan’s horns, had actually blocked Di Tian’s sword. However, the Godly Taotie Bull’s enormous body was now falling rapidly from the sky. It fell from five thousand meters to two thousand meters. Because it was about a thousand meters tall, it looked almost as if it were about to crash into Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Godly Taotie Bull let out a deafening roar as yellow plumes of clouds separated from its feet and struggled to support its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian continued to float where he was as he pointed the gigantic sword in his hand at Elder Xuan. His eyes were extremely frightening, as they resembled that of the Devilgod himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was absolute power. The absolute power of the world’s strongest individual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan suddenly felt powerless. Di Tian had already controlled all spatial power. Most importantly, he had realized the power gap between a second soul core built from the Resonance technique and a soul core built from the Yin Yang Complement technique. The density of Di Tian’s soul power was not something his soul power could compare to. The frightening dark aura continued to devour his earth-type elemental energy greedily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he knew that he could not retreat. He must not allow Di Tian to disturb Huo Yuhao at this crucial moment. If not, Yuhao might never be able to push past his current bottleneck. He might even die instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan closed his eyes as the flashback of Elder Mu reminding him of his wishes before his death flashed across his eyes. His enormous Godly Taotie Bull body did not fly straight up into the sky. Instead, it waited down there patiently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The figure revolved, and the Godly Taotie Bull disappeared. Elder Xuan reappeared as his powerful aura vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian’s face revealed a faint smile. In his eyes, Elder Xuan was about to give up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Elder Xuan were to even give up on his own Martial Soul True Body, what else would he fight Di Tian with?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Di Tian started to become worried again in no time.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is Elder Xuan really going to consent like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A primordial aura started to radiate from Elder Xuan’s body. A low but resonant dragon roar echoed in the sky as a layer of pale yellow flames rose around Elder Xuan’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That ancient aura contained the authority and might of the Dragons. Even Di Tian’s heart couldn’t help but contract under the pressure of that aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was not the first time he had sensed this aura. Previously, when the Great Star Dou Forest had started the beast wave, he had experienced it firsthand. Even with his power, he was only able to break free from it after a few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, he was sensing the power of the Taotie from Elder Xuan's body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xuan Zi, are you crazy? You actually want to fight with your life on the line?” Di Tian was both furious and shocked by what he was seeing. “I have repeatedly gone easy on you, yet you don’t seem to know how to retreat. Do you really think I don’t dare to kill you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was usually impossible for Elder Xuan to draw upon the power of the Taotie within his blood. However, if he burned his soul power and forced his soul core to release all of his power, it became possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not fatal for an Ultimate Douluo to burn his or her own soul power. As long as their soul core remained intact, the Ultimate Douluo would have a chance of recovering. However, burning one's soul power was still extremely demanding on one's body. It would definitely take a long time for the cultivator to recover and recuperate. Right now, Elder Xuan was burning his soul power as he tried to summon that bit of pure Taotie power within his blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because both the Taotie and Di Tian were Dragons, Elder Xuan could only stand a chance against Di Tian by harnessing the power of the Taotie to delay him from confronting Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan did not know how long he could withstand the furious attacks of Di Tian. However, he knew he had to do what he could to fight for as much time as possible for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian became increasingly worried as he saw how Elder Xuan did not plan on revealing anything to him. Now he was certain that Huo Yuhao must be doing something which could not be revealed to the rest of the world. In addition, Elder Xuan must know what was going on in order to put his life on the line to defend him. From the balance of interests, this meant that whatever Huo Yuhao was doing was of equal value to the life of an Ultimate Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian was the Beast God, and he possessed the domineering Golden Eyes Black Dragon King bloodline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he was not exactly sure what was going on, he was certain that this would not be a good thing for the Great Star Dou Forest. If not, Elder Xuan would not have tried to evade his questions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After coming to this realization, Di Tian was able to toss away all of his former reservations as a frightening golden glow lit up in his eyes. The soul beasts who were familiar with him would recognize this. This was Di Tian’s scariest state. This meant that he had developed murderous intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gigantic Dark Dragon Sword rose once again as it brought strong winds and heavy clouds in the sky. The dense purple-black clouds seemed to turn the entire world dark, while Di Tian slowly took on a dark purple color in mid-air. His entire body seemed to have turned into the same color as his Dark Dragon’s Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mystical sight started to form behind Di Tian’s back. A black sun and a purple moon appeared behind him as they overlapped and illuminated one another. Di Tian’s frightening aura began to surge once again at an incredible rate. This gave the surrounding people the impression that the dark clouds in the sky were about to fall and crush everything beneath them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe, Xian Lin’er, and the others all revealed shocked expressions. This was the real aura of the Beast God—the most powerful individual in the world!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is Di Tian about to go all-out on Elder Xuan?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even with their collective abilities, they felt as if they would not even be able to stand a chance against Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan seemed to be unfazed by the mystical sight forming in the sky. He continued to float in mid-air indignantly as the faint yellow flame around his body became increasingly intense. A mystical faint figure also started to form behind his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This faint figure had the head of a human, but the body of a goat. Its head was extremely large. It was the Taotie—one of the nine sons of the Dragon God! The Godly Taotie Bull’s Taotie bloodline was finally unleashed by Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Beast God’s aura seemed to weaken a little in the presence of the Taotie’s aura. After all, the Taotie’s bloodline power had the ability to suppress and curb the abilities of the Darkness Dragon bloodline.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, Elder Mu and Elder Xuan had to work together to activate the Taotie power to seal him. This was something that Di Tian remembered very clearly. This time around, he was not prepared to let the same thing happen again. He did not know how much more time Huo Yuhao needed to be done with his thing. What if he were to be done when he was in the midst of being sealed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian let out a cold grunt as he—the most powerful individual in the world—suddenly knelt in the direction of the Great Star Dou Forest in front of everyone. He sheathed the Dark Dragon Sword behind him, and appeared to be paying respects to something in that direction. The way he was paying respects resembled the gestures people made in military ceremonies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What is he doing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could there be someone in our world who is worthy of Di Tian’s reverence?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That would be unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan was equally startled by what Di Tian was doing. While he was trying to muster his Taotie aura towards Di Tian to suppress his Golden Eyes Black Dragon King’s aura, Di Tian was bowing in the direction of the Great Star Dou Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why is he doing that? Unless he has some other motives?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, the color of the sky above the Great Star Dou Forest suddenly changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky suddenly took on the seven different colors of the rainbow without any warning. The colored lights rotated amongst one another as though a God were about to descend from the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the lights appeared, they were actually able to dye the dense purple-black clouds that Di Tian had released with their colors. Following which, Di Tian’s aura transformed overwhelmingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His aura was originally extremely domineering. However, under the influence of the rainbow lights, Di Tian’s aura seemed to become grander and more majestic. When he stood up again, his golden pupils had become silver. Even though the sword in his hand did not change, the thousand-meter radius around him seemed to have undergone some sort of spatial transformation, as it turned into a silver domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What is this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan would not be the only one who did not know what this was. Even if all the past leaders of Shrek Academy were to witness this, they would also not be able to identify what power Di Tian was using now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only thing that Elder Xuan could distinguish was that this was not Di Tian’s own power. He seemed to have borrowed power from some other entity. Nonetheless, what did he actually borrow?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he was still in shock, an authoritative force suddenly descended from the sky. The gigantic Taotie that was behind Elder Xuan started to tremble before exhibiting the tendency to bow down to this authoritative force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This can’t be it.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first thought that entered Elder Xuan’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, both he and Elder Mu had used the power of the Taotie to suppress Di Tian. The authority in the blood of the Taotie—one of the nine sons of the Dragon God—was enough to force the Golden Eyes Black Dragon King to bow down to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at this instant, the situation seemed to have been reversed. The Taotie was now about to bow down to Di Tian, who was in the sky. How could this be happening? What kind of power did Di Tian borrow?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This instantaneous transformation not only startled Elder Xuan, but the people in Shrek City, as well as the Sun Moon Empire’s troops, were also startled by the sight before them. None of the powerful cultivators had expected this to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though they might not know how Elder Xuan’s Taotie should have suppressed Di Tian, they were still surprised that Di Tian was actually able to borrow power from a mysterious source within the Great Star Dou Forest. This was a frightening revelation. Was there another powerful individual hidden within the Great Star Dou Forest? Or was there some hidden treasure or source of power that no one knew about?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian stared coldly at Elder Xuan as he raised the Dark Dragon Sword above his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan discovered that the earth-type elemental energy which he was supposed to control with ease was suddenly beyond his control. It was cowering in fear from the aura Di Tian was emitting. It was as if a subordinate was bowing down to his or her superior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could Di Tian—an individual who possessed dark-type elemental energy—affect earth-type elements?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan’s heart sank as he realized how he would be unable to seal Di Tian even if he were to continue burning his soul power. When Di Tian landed the blow from his sword, it would definitely be earth-shattering.</span></p>
