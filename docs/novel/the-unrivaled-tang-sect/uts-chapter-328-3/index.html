At the point of collision, blue and golden light scattered. There were bolts of lightning, arc-shaped glows, and the impacts of shockwaves. All these caused the protective barriers around the stage to undulate with rings of light, and the spectators were unable to see what was happening on the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who won, who lost?!</span></p>

This duel was too important to them. If Wang Qiu’er won, it would prove that she was the strongest dragon-type soul master in this tournament!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lights lasted for seven to eight seconds before they slowly faded away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figures of Wang Qiu’er and Yu Tianlong were also slowly revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was panting heavily. The golden light on her body had become weaker, and there was a streak of blood at the edge of her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Tianlong’s condition was even worse than hers. The scales on his right shoulder and chest had rolled up, and he was bleeding profusely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked like he had been bitten by the golden dragon. His face was very pale.</span></p>

Yu Tianlong’s eyes were filled with a crazed look, perhaps because he was agitated after being hurt. He roared out, “I haven’t lost!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Intense bolts of lightning appeared once again. However, they were no longer black, only bluish-purple like before. He wiped his left hand on his chest and right shoulder. A patch of bluish-purple lightning flashed past, and he sealed his wounds, accompanied by the smell of burning flesh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His face contorted because of the intense pain. However, he grit his teeth and bore the pain stoically. He took a step forward with his left leg and flew up. He opened his arms wide, as if he wanted to hug Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s expression was still very cold. Her competitive will didn’t seem to waver because her opponent had gone crazy. She also moved her left leg forward and leapt into the air, not giving in at all as she barreled towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Tianlong’s arms expanded, and he slashed towards the sides of Wang Qiu’er’s body with his Lightning Dragon’s Claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had once tested this attack before; even a huge granite boulder was blown to ashes after he hugged it with this attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being dealt a huge blow by Wang Qiu’er, he forgot all about his romantic feelings. There was only a burning competitiveness in his heart. He wanted to win!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er smacked her hands to her sides and resisted his attack forcefully. She was also very adept at using her trademark attacks!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two booms sounded at the same time. The Golden Dragon edged out the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon once again. Even though Yu Tianlong had already tried his best for this attack, he still didn’t manage to gain any headway as his claws clashed with Wang Qiu’er’s shining, golden hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er grabbed onto his dragon claws and pulled them backward. She seemed to be pulling Yu Tianlong into her embrace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Yu Tianlong saw her lifting her right knee in front of her chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Subconsciously, he wanted to lift his leg to kick her. However, her arms shook at this moment, and two waves of force spread through his arms. Yu Tianlong screamed in pain, and his arms were abruptly dislocated even though he was protected by the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following this, Wang Qiu’er’s golden knee touched his chest, but she pointed it down immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was merciful towards him. When her knee hit his chest, she let go of his claws. Yu Tianlong was smashed to the ground. His entire body caved into the floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Wang Qiu’er hadn’t let go of his hands, his arms would have been torn off as she struck him in the chest with her knee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Victory had been decided at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er drifted back to the ground in front of Yu Tianlong.</span></p>

As he looked at the gloomy sky above, there was an indignant look on his face. However, he had indeed lost this fight. Wang Qiu’er had even let him off twice, even though she could have seriously hurt him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She hadn’t torn his arms off, and she hadn’t struck the center of his chest. Otherwise, his sternum would have been shattered.</span></p>

She’s really too strong! I’ve lost. I can’t beat her. While our abilities aren’t too far apart, she’s able to repress me in every aspect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Tianlong shut his eyes indignantly. Blood still flowed from his nose and mouth. However, the crazed look on his face slowly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Zhan walked forward quickly and checked Yu Tianlong’s condition. After he did so, he immediately gestured.</span></p>

When Wang Qiu’er’s right knee struck Yu Tianlong to the ground, all the main team members and substitutes from Shrek’s team jumped up in excitement. They couldn’t be bothered even when they flipped the chairs and tables and quickly rushed out of the resting area.</span></p>

As members of Shrek’s Seven Monsters, they also carried Shrek’s glory on their shoulders! Seeing that Shrek’s team had entered the finals once again, they couldn’t help but recall everything that had happened in the last tournament. They too had toiled to win that tournament! All of them were feeling emotional at this point.</span></p>

Ever since Wang Qiu’er had saved Huo Yuhao, she had experienced great emotional changes with regards to Wang Qiu’er. She knew deeply that nothing was going on between Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er. On the stage that day, she had claimed that Wang Qiu’er was her sister. After that, she experienced even greater emotional changes. As she witnessed how Wang Qiu’er defeated Yu Tianlong, she felt as if she were the one on the stage. For an instant, she even thought that she had turned into Wang Qiu’er and fought Yu Tianlong herself.</span></p>

Qiu’er has really led Shrek into the finals through her individual abilities. Qiu’er, you’ve led your teammates to this stage entirely through your own determination and abilities! I know how much you must have sacrificed. Your abilities have also improved. You deserve to enter the final match!</span></p>

She didn’t seem very excited. She was just as cold as ever.</span></p>

Although his injuries weren’t light, he wasn’t too gravely hurt, as Wang Qiu’er had taken mercy on him.</span></p>

I’m lost convincingly. My abilities are indeed inferior to yours. However, this doesn’t mean I’ll always be lousier than you. I’ll exceed you one day!”</span></p>

From now on, I’ll be your servant for three years.”</span></p>
