 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, Huo Yuhao was stunned to find out that this pill furnace was easier to control using the Haodong Power compared to when he used his own strength. In addition, the effect seemed to be better too. The strong medicinal composition in the furnace seemed to submit to the Haodong Power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t just because the Haodong Power was much stronger than Huo Yuhao’s individual soul power. It seemed like the Haodong Power contained some kind of strength that the essences of the medicine had no choice but to submit to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the medicinal fluid inside the furnace had fully taken form. Huo Yuhao was down to the last step of the cultivation, which was forming the pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What this meant was that the essences inside the furnace had to be compressed further to turn them into pills. This process was the simplest compared to the other steps, but it was the most draining too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao started on this step, the Class 9 furnace seemed to be unable to take it, and needed to release some pressure first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, the medicinal essences were stabilized with Tang Wutong’s help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As their soul power flowed in their bodies, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong both shone with golden light. The bright and transparent golden light caused the glow emanating from their bodies to become stronger and stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On Huo Yuhao’s forehead, his Eye of Destiny was already opened. In the center of his pupil, a whirlpool formed by his soul core was spinning rapidly. However, on a closer look, it was clear that this rapidly-spinning whirlpool was no longer as black and deep as before. Rather, it was formed from black and white. The mysterious black and white continuously formed the images of Yin and Yang, and a weird spiritual undulation was revolving around Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Tang Wutong, the golden trident on her forehead was very clear. It exuded an elegant yet domineering aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their Haodong Power formed a massive golden whirlpool with their bodies at the center. This whirlpool was spinning rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The diameter of this golden whirlpool was around three meters, but it didn’t expand further. Within it, there was immense soul power. At the core of this whirlpool, a crystal entity that resembled that of a soul core seemed to have taken form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A soul core from a martial soul fusion? Regarding this, even Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were unsure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their soul core presented itself in a jujube-like shape. Not long after their Haodong Power consolidated, it appeared. As they cultivated further and further, this soul core also became more and more evident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong could only sense that there was an extremely terrifying compressed soul power contained within their soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had been cultivating over the past few months, but hadn’t had a chance to fight yet. After all, Huo Yuhao was very busy with his learning and research. However, he deeply believed that their martial soul fusion had to be a hundred and twenty percent now, if it had been a hundred percent before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chi——” The vent holes were sizzling again. Following this, the entire furnace turned a blinding gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strong golden lights flashed, and a fragrance swept over the entire place. After this, the lights retracted once again before shooting into the sky. The temperature in the entire laboratory rose quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A large number of rare metals started to soften under this high temperature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stretched out his hands in front of him, and an icy-blue glow was instantly released from his body, turning into a massive barrier that engulfed the golden lights. This helped to isolate the extremely high temperature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dim light shone, and Huo Yuhao revealed an icy-cold and mysterious look on his face. He pointed at the furnace with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While it seemed like a simple action, it actually helped to stabilize the furnace, which was shaking tremendously. This wasn’t the effect of his Ultimate Ice, but a result of his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Spirit Eyes’ soul core released unprecedently strong spiritual undulations, and immense spiritual pressure descended, compressing the medicinal energy that was stirring in the furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, Huo Yuhao only felt that his emotions were like a hill and he was like a mountain, as he suppressed the undulations of the medicinal energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Emotions, was this the power of emotions?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he saw the God of Emotions, Huo Yuhao’s use of his emotional strength wasn’t deliberate. It only happened because his yearning for Wang Dong’er was too intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, his action was deliberate. He had actually succeeded. Right now, his emotions were terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he fused such power into his spiritual power, Huo Yuhao only felt that his spirit, spiritual power and emotions had fused into one entity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immense soul power undulations were released under such conditions, fusing with the strange spiritual undulations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong, who was seated by Huo Yuhao, had already opened her eyes. She was completely astonished. Whatever Huo Yuhao felt, she felt the same too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of strength is this? It’s so powerful.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that instant, she only felt that Huo Yuhao had become a mighty mountain in front of her. He was immovable, and completely domineering. Even she felt that he was irresistible, even though she had fused with him to generate their Haodong Power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden light from the furnace slowly turned golden-red before gradually dimming. The medicinal energy that was seeping out finally retracted into the furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao let out a long breath, and his emotions also became less intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pills were done!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even as the mighty feeling disappeared, Huo Yuhao was still Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong pulled her palms back and took a deep breath. She slowly stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Was it successful?” She asked softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao turned around and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao then stood up and came in front of the pill furnace with Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong said, “It seems like your strength seemed to change earlier? What kind of strength was that? It can actually suppress medicinal energy. At that moment, I could even sense that you didn’t use much of the Haodong Power either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao asked, “Do you still remember my Three Ultimate Haodong Skills?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong revealed a warm look in her eyes when she heard the words ‘Three Ultimate Haodong Skills’, and nodded. How could she not remember? Before she regained her memories, she had personally witnessed him using them. Back then, Huo Yuhao had used his Three Ultimate Haodong Skills to astonish the Death God Douluo. She only truly understood that strong sense of yearning after she recovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and gently hugged her waist, saying, “The reason why my Three Ultimate Haodong Skills are so strong is because I fused everything in my life into them. During the fusion process, the catalyst was my emotions, my yearning for you. This helped me to discover the profundity of emotions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The same soul master with the same abilities can unleash different fighting strengths under different emotions. If he can properly control his emotions and fuse them with his abilities, he can greatly increase their power. Earlier, I tried to fuse my emotions and the spiritual power of my Spirit Eyes together before using everything I had to ensure a complete fusion. In that way, I was able to unleash two hundred percent of my abilities through my emotional undulations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong appeared pensive. “Such a self-created soul skill isn’t simple! I shall try it too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao lowered his head and said, “In fact, I don’t think it’s as effective as the original Three Ultimate Haodong Skills, even though I’ve managed to comprehend some of the mysteries within them. You should know that I relied on my Three Ultimate Haodong Skills to kill an evil Soul Douluo when I was still a Soul Emperor. Come, I’ll let you sense my emotions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, a strong sense of love mixed with his spiritual power spread towards Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was stunned. Following this, her ears turned red. She seemed to be tearing up a little as she looked at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She couldn’t resist his love at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, everyone’s waiting outside. Quickly, open the furnace.” Tang Wutong said softly as she leaned against Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately stepped back. The mysterious, sealed power on Tang Wutong’s body was too terrifying. He had tried to resist it before, but the final result was that he got bruised. Furthermore, the more he resisted, the more tragic he became.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had used the furnace until he was very familiar with it. He touched the furnace a few times before it released a layer of soul power undulations. Following this, the temperature of the furnace rose again. It was releasing the heat and pressure inside it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao waved his right hand, and a layer of Ultimate Ice formed a meter away from the furnace, dissipating the heat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This lasted for ten minutes before the heat inside the furnace was fully dissipated. Huo Yuhao mimicked a lifting action, and the cover of the furnace slowly rose with a creak. The medicinal fragrance that had disappeared earlier immediately swept the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fragrance was only released for an instant, but Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong felt as if their pores had been opened. They were greedily absorbing the essence of heaven and earth into their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something even stranger appeared. A layer of light surged out of the furnace and formed a smooth glow. Within this glow shone lights that resembled the intersection of sunrays and moonlight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Qiankun Fortune Pills were completed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao lifted his head to look inside the furnace. He also didn’t know how many pills he could cultivate. He had used almost all the materials he had, as he had wanted to maximize the effect of the medicine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he looked at the Qiankun Fortune Pills, he couldn’t help but reveal an astonished look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pills were milky-white and smooth. Every pill was covered in fog, and was the size of a fingernail. There weren’t many of them. It seemed like there were only seven pills. Yes, there were exactly seven pills.</span></p>
