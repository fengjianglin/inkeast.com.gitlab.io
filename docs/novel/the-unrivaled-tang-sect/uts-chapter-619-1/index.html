 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian had an eight hundred thousand year cultivation! His abilities were unparalleled. Their palms shone at the same time. Golden and black lights clashed instantly.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were originally only a hundred meters apart from each other. However, after they clashed, the gap between them immediately widened significantly, as if they had sparked each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strong ball of light formed at the center of where they were earlier. After this, a terrifying energy storm caused space to shake tremendously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A huge black hole instantly appeared at that position. It was more than three thousand meters in diameter, and it was devouring everything furiously, such that the clouds below were rising towards that black hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some strange also happened. Below the black hole, there seemed to be a black and golden tornado. It only lasted for ten seconds, but it was an abnormal phenomenon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Di Tian were several thousands of meters apart now. Di Tian appeared very surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">’</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">ve formed your third soul core?

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuaho nodded slightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes. Otherwise, why do you think I dared to challenge you?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The breakthrough was already at its most critical moment. The strength of the Ice and Snow Empresses were almost fully drained. Huo Yuhao’s third soul core had already taken form in his dantian, but it was circulating on its own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting in the cave, Huo Yuhao could sense a lot right now. He knew that the next fusion was going to be the most critical one. If it succeeded, he would improve by leaps and bounds. If he failed, both he and Tang Wutong were doomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he had a choice, Huo Yuhao would rather not choose to cultivate his third soul core forever. He wasn’t willing to take the risk with Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Dragon Emperor Douluo and Death God Douluo had poured too much soul power into their bodies. If they didn’t absorb the soul power, they were mostly likely going to die. If they couldn’t control the soul power, they would die even faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why they were in closed-door cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What he had to do now was let his third soul core fuse with his other two soul cores. A new chain was also to be formed during the collision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he hadn’t absorbed the Evileye Tyrant King’s spiritual power and raised his spiritual power to a new tier, Huo Yuhao would really be lacking confidence. Right now, he had some confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He immediately relied on his spiritual intent to slow down the circulation speed of his three soul cores. The slower they were, the less likely it was for mistakes to occur during the fusion later on. This was undoubtedly the best choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he slowed down his three soul cores, Huo Yuhao started to adjust them slightly again. He increased the circulation speed of his first soul core, which was his spiritual soul core, whereas he slowed his other two soul cores down even further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this way, things became a little messy between his intersecting first and second soul cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their fusion was built on a foundation of balance. This was how Huo Yuhao had completed the Yin-Yang Complement ,method. Right now, the balance was affected when their speeds were altered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His soul power undulations became a little unsteady. However, Huo Yuhao made a strange choice. He silently drew out the spiritual power in his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spiritual soul core was at the core of his spiritual sea. As he drew out his spiritual power, a part of his spiritual soul core slowly separated itself from his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The immense spiritual power in his spiritual sea was the origin of his spiritual soul core. Without the support of his spiritual sea, his spiritual soul core couldn’t possibly stay stable. Only someone like Huo Yuhao with such immense spiritual control could do something like this. If a Titled Douluo tried this, he would most likely have died by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His soul power bulged a little. After this, Huo Yuhao started to struggle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under his control, the spiritual power which he drew from his spiritual soul core started to sink towards his chest, whereas his second soul core rose as it was pushed by his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, he was trying to switch their positions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the best method if he wanted to cultivate his third soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After absorbing the Evileye Tyrant King’s immense spiritual power, Huo Yuhao’s soul cores were already a little unbalanced. This was because his spiritual soul core was too strong, and his Ultimate Ice soul core paled in comparison. This was why the strength of his spiritual soul core would devour that of his Ultimate Ice soul core just as they collided to form his whirlpool-like soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to this, Huo Yuhao was forced to separate a part of his spiritual sea from his spiritual soul core. Right now, he was relying on the strength of his spiritual soul core to complete this fusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His two soul cores shifted positions. The pain made him feel as if his organs were being torn apart before being put back into place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Huo Yuhao was already prepared, he still felt excruciating pain when he got to doing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His two soul cores passed each other. At that instant, blood streamed out from all his pores. Given his physical strength, he was still unable to bear such excruciating pain. On his forehead, his Eye of Destiny had already uncontrollably opened. However, it was dim inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Eye of Destiny had fused with his spiritual soul core! Now that his spiritual soul core was being moved away, it greatly influenced his Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he still persisted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His two soul cores were finally separated. His Ultimate Ice soul core was heading up, and his spiritual soul core was heading down. The energies that clashed generated unstable soul power. A low-pitched blast could be heard coming from Huo Yuhao’s body. This was because his soul power wasn’t stable, leading to minor ‘explosions’ in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, his Ultimate Ice soul core was pushed to where his spiritual soul core had been, and his spiritual soul core was also moved to his chest. Both soul cores were guiding each other. They wanted to return to their original positions. The chain between them was like a taut rubber band. Once it was released, it would immediately catapult both soul cores back to where they were originally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao actually opened his eyes right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If anyone could see the look in his eyes, he would discover that distorted lights were shining inside of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was shaking as he lifted his right hand. He pressed it against his Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was normally a very simple action, but it appeared very difficult for him now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Huo Yuhao’s right hand was high enough. He used force and pressed his right hand against his Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A weird ball of light shone. Huo Yuhao groaned slightly. He already sounded like a wild beast. At the same time, he removed the last layer of protection around his third soul core. The force generated from the circulation of his third soul core instantly appeared. Strong traction was immediately unleashed. The spatial whirlpool-like soul power it generated immediately clashed with the spiritual soul core at his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also at this moment that unprecedently strong spiritual power was unleashed from Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny. There was a strong suction force. At the same time, Huo Yuhao released control of his first and second soul cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both soul cores immediately sprung back to where they had been .</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the strength of his third soul core was guiding his spiritual soul core. The strong suction force caused his third soul core to be wrenched out from his dantian. It left its original position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If there was one word to describe the situation in Huo Yuhao’s body right now, that word was ‘messy’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His three soul cores had shifted positions. Whether it was his spiritual power, Ultimate Ice soul power or spatial-type energy, everything was a mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there was one thing that was in order as his three soul cores circulated, and that was his spiritual soul core, which was trying to return to his brow, and his Ultimate Ice soul core, which wanted to return to its original position too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was even accelerated because of the great suction force that was suddenly generated by his Eye of Destiny, such that his spiritual soul core instantly sprang back into its original position. It stuck closely to his Eye of Destiny, and unprecedentedly strong spiritual power was unleashed. At that instant, Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core and Eye of Destiny fused completely with his spiritual sea. His spiritual power was enhanced even further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the mountain peak that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were on turned pure gold because of this terrifying spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that traction was simply too strong, such that his Ultimate Ice soul core immediately sprung away again. His third soul core also sprung up once again this time. The energy between both soul cores caused them to clash with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two soul cores were obviously circulating in different directions. Something strange occurred. Under Huo Yuhao’s precise control, they instantly fused through the Yin-Yang Complement method. However, they weren’t where they were supposed to be. Rather, they were close to Huo Yuhao’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three soul cores formed a strange triangular shape.</span></p>
