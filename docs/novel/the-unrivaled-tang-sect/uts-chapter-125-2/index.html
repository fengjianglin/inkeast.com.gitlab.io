 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The might of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion then vanished like a flash in the dark.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfurling his wings, Wang Dong once again revealed his powerful evasion skills in midair. Guided by the Spiritual Detection, over 90% of the soul tool attacks targeting him would miss completely. However, Wang Dong’s figure was gradually approaching the Hongchen siblings.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Meng Hongchen had finally caught her breath. She had just used her fourth soul skill, Ice Feeding. By using fire as a catalyst, she was able to stimulate her Icetoad poison and turn it into pure energy that could feed her body, causing her attack power to reach a completely new level.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she wouldn’t be able to use the Icetoad for a short period of time after using Ice Feeding. On the surface, it seemed as though Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had spent more energy than their opponents. However, the string of collisions had greatly affected Meng Hongchen as well.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She could no longer use her Icetoad poison, and her Ice Feeding hadn’t even increased her attack power, but merely allowed her to regain the ability to move. Why wouldn’t she have spent a large amount of energy? Furthermore, the freezing caused by the Ultimate Ice had caused her injuries from Dai Yueheng’s attack to resurge faintly.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao sighed inwardly. If their previous attack that relied on their opponents looking down on them had succeeded, winning this match would’ve been much easier. However, it now seemed that it wouldn’t be possible to win this match without a fight.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Hongchen siblings now felt a tremendous amount of pressure coming from Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. The most terrifying opponent that one could face was one that was completely unreadable. However, these two youths who were even younger than them had damaged the conviction they had in winning.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister, come. Let’s finish them off. We can’t hesitate any longer.” Xiao Hongchen let out a deep shout.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Hongchen hesitated, “But, your body…”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do these injuries amount to?” Xiao Hongchen said arrogantly, “Let’s show them our strongest attack. Quick. We can’t lose this match. We can’t give them a chance. Once we beat them, we’ll be the pride of our academy, and the heroes of our empire.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, all of the soul tools on Xiao Hongchen’s body suddenly switched off and fell to the ground. The soul tools themselves turned back into metallic dust, and he didn’t even bother to care about the formation arrays that had fallen to the ground. Instead, he spread his hands out towards his sister.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rapiers in Meng Hongchen’s hands vanished as she turned around and threw herself into Xiao Hongchen’s embrace. Immediately, a pillar mixed with golden and ice-blue light surged into the air and instantly covered their bodies.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not good.” Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were simply too familiar with their movements. That was clearly the starting sign of a martial soul fusion! They had already evaluated the Hongchen siblings highly, but they’d never thought that the two soul engineers would actually be able to use a fusion skill. Furthermore, they were using it at this extremely critical moment.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When two Soul Kings used a fusion skill together, how powerful would their attack be? They were clearly trying to take Huo Yuhao’s duo out in one shot.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s take them on!” Wang Dong let out a shout. Because he was overly excited, there seemed to be a few traces of delicateness contained in his voice.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took a deep breath. He could no longer hesitate at this moment. Otherwise, their last chance of winning would disappear.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immediately dispelling the Ice Empress’ Armor, Huo Yuhao hugged Wang Dong. At the same time, the aura of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion returned to his body, leaving only his Spirit Eyes.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’s wings quietly vanished, causing the dazzling bluish-golden light in the sky to disappear. Wang Dong hugged Huo Yuhao from the back, then descended to the tournament stage. At this moment however, a pitch-black hammer appeared in his hand. This was his second martial soul, the Clear Sky Hammer.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were about to fall to the ground, but at this moment, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s bodies released a dazzling light.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an indescribable light of nothingness that caused everything contained within it to vanish from sight. The only thing left was an illusory figure. This illusory figure looked somewhat strange, and its entire body was transparent. Its face couldn’t be clearly seen, but its hands formed the shape of a heart.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figure looked like an adult male, and if anyone had seen the initial display of Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s Heavenly Emperor’s Hammer, they would’ve discovered that this void-like figure was identical to that of the aforementioned skill.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Heavenly Emperor’s Hammer was formed by the fusion between the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion and the Clear Sky Hammer. On the other hand, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong weren’t using the Golden Road that was formed by the Radiant Butterfly Goddess and the Spirit Eyes, nor the Heavenly Emperor’s Hammer. Instead, they were using the mysterious fusion between the Spirit Eyes and the Clear Sky Hammer.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything passed by quickly as both parties unexpectedly released their respective fusion skills together. This was the first time that this had happened in this year’s Continental Advanced Academy Soul Duelling Tournament.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The audience felt as though their hearts were about to jump out from their throats. A scene like this would be rarely seen even in a hundred years!</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How many soul masters in this world could possess a fusion skill? The fact that two pairs of them had appeared at this moment was simply too shocking.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Elder Xuan from Shrek Academy was already clenching his fists tightly. Were it not for the fact that he was distracted by suppressing the black flames of the Dark Phoenix, he would’ve had an even more excited expression.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The excitement from this event was so great, to the point where even Wang Yan couldn’t even bear to look at it. He covered his face with both hands, only revealing his eyes. He was the only person who knew how many fusion skills Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong possessed, but even he had never seen the true might of those fusion skills. Nobody knew just how Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were able to create a miracle like this.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen were in perfectly good conditions today, he would never have allowed Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong to take the stage. However, Xiao Hongchen was heavily injured, and Meng Hongchen was somewhat injured. Only thus did a chance of Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong winning come into existence.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Wang Yan would never have thought that the Hongchen siblings would be able to bring a fusion skill out. This was a practically unimaginable even in the world of soul engineers. It could even be said that Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen were the first pair of soul masters from the Sun Moon Empire who were able to do so.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over on the city wall, Emperor Xu Jiawei had an astonished expression on his face. Who would’ve thought that the finals of this tournament would actually turn into a duel between two fusion skills?</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the most depressed and pained person in the entire arena was the referee, the Heavenfiend Douluo. At this moment, he naturally couldn’t stop both parties from using their fusion skills. However, just what level would the might of both fusion skills reach? He wasn’t clear about that! In the event he wasn’t able to rescue the losing party in time, resulting in a casualty, the burden placed on him would be far too great. He was very clear that the four people who were standing on the battlefield were very different from the previous people who had died.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pillar of light that Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen floated into began to transform. The pillar of light solidified in mid-air, turning into the enormous shape of a toad. Mysteriously, a change in color suddenly occurred to the toad while it solidified.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the gold of the Three-Legged Golden Toad and the ice-blue of the Vermillion Clear Icetoad completely vanished, leaving a red light that emitted a metallic glint. The scarlet-gold that covered it made the enormous toad that was over five meters tall incomparably dazzling. Its eyes were a shade of black that was as deep as an abyss.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As it widened its mouth, a violently spinning scarlet-gold whirlpool could be faintly seen. It seemed as though the toad could spit out the whirlpool at any time.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Hongchen’s voice rang out across the entire field. Even at a time like this, he didn’t forget to play the part of a hero who was trying to save the battle.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take this blow, youngsters. We’ll let you witness what a truly powerful fusion skill is, our Hongchen’s Yearning.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right. Hongchen’s Yearning was the name they had chosen for their fusion skill by taking the family name of the two siblings. If one looked carefully at it, one would discover that the reddish-golden toad was three-legged. However, its eyes were flashing with the same light as that of the Vermillion Clear Icetoad the instant it was about to spit out the reddish-gold whirlpool.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this exact moment, a change also began to occur to the illusory figure that Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had formed. His eyes lit up.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since his entire body was in a void-like and transparent state, the flash in his eyes was especially obvious. This was a pair of eyes that couldn’t be described using words. Its dazzling gold seemed to absorb and coagulate all of the starlight in the skies. The instant that mysterious golden luster appeared, the light on the entire tournament stage actually darkened. The drizzling rain in the sky instantly paused, and every single drop of rain remained in its descending state, unable to fall any further.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strange vertical eye slowly opened on the void-like figure’s forehead, and a light filled with the aura of life instantly illuminated the entire arena. Faintly, a glorious golden hammer appeared out of nowhere, then shattered into countless smaller hammers above the void-like figure. Then, these smaller hammers transformed into golden light, causing a golden halo to appear on the void-like figure’s forehead.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything that was occurring seemed to slow down, but spider web-like cracks appeared within the air on the tournament stage wherever the golden light passed. It seemed as though space was going to cave in.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the Heavenfiend Douluo was left dumbstruck at this moment. This was because he clearly felt that his movements had uncontrollably slowed down. Not only that, but he felt his chest depress. Right after that, it seemed as though an enormous hammer had suddenly pounded his spiritual sea, instantly sending his mind into a field of white. The deepest part of his spiritual sea suddenly shook violently, making it seem as though all of his memories were able to burst apart,</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the reaction of a Titled Douluo, and even he couldn’t resist at all. This was because at that moment, the Heavenfiend Douluo Huang Jinxu simply didn’t know how to block that mysterious golden light. Naturally, this was because he couldn’t make a move to disturb the match as a referee.</span></p>
