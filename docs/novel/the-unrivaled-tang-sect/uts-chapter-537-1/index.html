 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What about Xiao Xiao? In fact, she also possessed twin martial souls! Yes, Xiao Xiao, the girl who usually kept a low profile, was a soul master with twin martial souls. Among Shrek’s Seven Monsters, she was the third person, other than Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, who had twin martial souls. They were the cream of the crop among the new students of Shrek Academy back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Xiao Xiao rarely sparred with anyone, that did not mean she was weak. Under the powerful effects of the Qiankun Fortune Pill, her cultivation had improved tremendously. Also, she was the direct disciple of Elder Xuan, who was an actual Ultimate Douluo! If he was willing to hand his teachings over to Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, why would he not teach his final disciple?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, amongst everyone present, Huo Yuhao was undoubtedly the person who had the most confidence in her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how Huo Yuhao had given his consent, Ji Juechen said, “Alright, let’s do it then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou became anxious as he tried to grab Xiao Xiao’s arm. “Xiao Xiao, you shouldn’t! This is too dangerous. What am I going to do if something bad happens to you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao replied casually, “Then go and find another person!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou was angered by her words. “What do you mean by ‘find another person’? I only want you. Besides, you have already done that to me. You must take responsibility.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words hit everyone like a bolt from the blue. After hearing He Caitou’s words, Xu Sanshi immediately pulled Jiang Nannan back as they returned to listen to the juicy gossip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei’s eyes also widened in disbelief, while Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong looked at Xiao Xiao with a surprised expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao immediately became the center of attention. She started blushing as she glared at He Caitou in a vicious manner. “Can you not spout rubbish? You’re spoiling my spiritual state. You’re going to be responsible if I lose later. And stop asking weird questions like who will be responsible for you and who did what with you. If you continue to ask stupid questions like that, I will ignore you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing Xiao Xiao blush, He Caitou frantically said, “How can you fight against Juechen when you’re so flustered now? Come, let’s go and cultivate by the side to calm your mind and heart down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he was about to pull Xiao Xiao away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his pull was ineffective. Xiao Xiao’s feet seemed to be rooted to the ground. Of course, He Caitou would not use his real strength to pull her away. However, he could sense the determination in her to spar with Ji Juechen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he lowered his head to look at her, he was surprised by the look on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao’s eyes had grown calm, and the flustered look on her face had disappeared. What was left was a look of calmness and determination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiao Xiao, you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Caitou.” Xiao Xiao’s voice was very gentle. “I know you treat me well and are afraid that I will get hurt. I understand how you feel towards me. But you must know that I will not only become your wife in the future. At the same time, I will still be a member of Shrek’s Seven Monsters! All these years, I have seen how Yuhao has fought countless battles in the north and the south. All of you have also been busy with projects within the Tang Sect. But what about me? Under your protection, I have been like a bird who is unable to spread her wings. I know you care for me and dote on me. But I do not want to be a flower in a greenhouse. And I have the abilities to not be a flower in a greenhouse. I can stay strong without your protection. I am not just your lover and partner. In times of war, I can be your companion who can fight alongside you and help everyone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have never cut myself any slack on my training in all these years. And I train hard because I want to help everyone on the battlefield. But all of you have subconsciously excluded me from any dangerous or challenging tasks. I want this to stop, and I want to prove to all of you that I, Xiao Xiao, also possess the ability to become a true member of Shrek’s Seven Monsters. So please don’t stop me, Caitou! Let me prove it to you, alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao’s words silenced everyone as they started to ask themselves if that was truly the case. Jiang Nannan empathized with her words most strongly. Other than Tang Wutong, she was the only female among Shrek’s Seven Monsters along with Xiao Xiao. Even though Tang Wutong was able to fight alongside Huo Yuhao and had experienced so much, both Jiang Nannan and Xiao Xiao were always living under the care and protection of everyone else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, after hearing Xiao Xiao’s words, which resonated strongly in her heart, she let go of Xu Sanshi’s hand and walked towards Xiao Xiao. “Xiao Xiao, I support you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao held Jiang Nannan’s hand and smiled. She was truly beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou was a little dazed after staring at her beautiful smile. It took him a while before he shook it off and revealed an understanding smile. He sighed before saying, “I am sorry, Xiao Xiao. I must have neglected your feelings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao let go of Jiang Nannan’s hand before walking towards He Caitou. She actually dove into his embrace in front of everyone. “No, Caitou. I am really fortunate and blissful to have you. To be honest, I actually hesitated back then when I chose you. But afterwards, I understood how right I was to have chosen you. Caitou, I really enjoy receiving the care and concern you have for me. But I am so sad to see how hard you work every day. I really want to help you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou hugged her tightly as he stared at her lovingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen, who had been standing by the side, suddenly slapped his forehead and muttered, “Why do I suddenly feel like I’m the antagonist of this show?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his words, everyone burst into laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei smiled and replied, “Brother Ju, you are truly the biggest antagonist in our Tang Sect. Who asked you to challenge people to fights every day?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen sighed, “I don’t really have a choice. In order to improve, I must find people to spar with. I am terribly sorry if I have inconvenienced you. But I will not change my ways, and will continue to challenge all of you to fights.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then bring it on.” Xiao Xiao escaped from He Caitou’s embrace, and her eyes were already burning with her desire to win.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen nodded and said, “Xiao Xiao, I will not go easy on you because you’re a girl.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who needs you to go easy on me? We don’t even know who will be victorious yet.” As she spoke, she moved to a position that placed her moderately far away from Ji Juechen and opposite him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, no one would stop them from sparring. They slowly moved back to give them space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong whispered into Huo Yuhao’s ear. “If Xiao Xiao loses, it will be my turn next, okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled. “Are you itching to get into a battle after dealing with the two evil soul masters?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong waved her little fist in front of Huo Yuhao and said, “Nope. I just want you men to know that us ladies are not that easy to bully. We are not weaker than men.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled. “Why do I have the feeling that I am your real target instead of Brother Ji?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong raised her head and replied, “If I were to challenge you to a duel, would you accept it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was shocked. “You’re not being serious, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong replied, “Why not? Yuhao, don’t you feel like you can’t find your own limits after our previous closed-door cultivation? It’s bad for us to not be able to accurately determine how strong we are. We will not be able to decide on the most effective way to deal with our enemies. Actually, Brother Ji’s cultivation method has many areas that are worth learning from. Regardless of what abilities we possess, we are only able to truly understand those abilities by sparring and exercising them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao mulled over her words before saying, “What you say makes sense. But I don’t think I can get myself to attack you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong burst into laughter and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll go easy on you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you so certain that you can beat me?” Huo Yuhao asked with raised eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course,” Tang Wutong answered proudly, “Don’t forget I’m already a Titled Douluo, while you’re still a Soul Douluo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But I also have a soul core,” Huo Yuhao replied, “this makes me pretty similar to a Titled Douluo!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong said, “If you don’t agree with me, you can always challenge me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “So be it. Let’s do it after Xiao Xiao and Brother Ji are done.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During their conversation, the way they stared into each other’s eyes seemed as though they were about to launch into a brawl. But it only stayed that way for a short while before both of them burst into laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! No matter what, they would never really fight with one another. Nonetheless, both of them were still fairly competitive. In fact, they were both really excited at the prospect of sparring with one another. It was exactly because they understood each other so well that they could not be certain who would emerge victorious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen and Xiao Xiao faced each other and, without communicating, both of them took a few steps back. Since it was a proper spar, it had to be fair. Both of them retreated until there were about fifty meters between them. Xiao Xiao specialized in mid-range combat, while Ji Juechen was most adept at close quarters. If the distance was too far, it would not be fair to Ji Juechen. If it were too close, it would be unfair to Xiao Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fifty meters was just nice for both of them. Both Ji Juechen and Xiao Xiao stood upright and stared at each other. Xiao Xiao once again radiated a calm aura, as though she was becoming one with her surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Ji Juechen was not the only one who felt that Xiao Xiao’s abilities were unpredictable. Even her other companions could sense it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei could not help but nod.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right! Regardless of whether it’s Xiao Xiao or Jiang Nannan, all of us have grown a lot. Even they are no longer little girls who everyone needs to protect. They can all take on the world themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao’s soul rings started to rise from her feet. Her first soul ring was yellow, but the subsequent ones were all black. All seven of her rings hung quietly around her as a flute appeared in her hands. The first martial soul which she released was not her main martial soul, the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron, but her second martial soul—the Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute.</span></p>
