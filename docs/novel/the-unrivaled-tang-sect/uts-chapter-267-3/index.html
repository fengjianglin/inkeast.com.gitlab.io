<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Hence, Huo Yuhao started with the recovery of his hands first.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">He distributed his soul power inside himself, concentrating it on his dantian. Huo Yuhao felt the Extreme Chill Icespring origin energy of heaven and earth brought by the Snow Empress. His cultivation had been reduced to three rings, which meant that he could only use the energy of three rings in battle. But he was still a soul king!</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Huo Yuhao first started to open up the meridians of his lower limbs.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">His powerful spiritual energy slowly entered his dantian and intermingled with his soul power. As his torso passageways were blocked, his soul power had not been able to undergo circular cultivation for a long time, causing them to appear sluggish. However, as Huo Yuhao directed his cultivation, his foundation was strong, and under the guidance of his spiritual energy, it slowly came back to life.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Huo Yuhao’s methodology was simple. First, he allowed his soul power to enter his legs, which helped to gradually open up the rigid passageways in his legs. Then, he made it do a simple circulation from his legs to his central meridians. This circulation allowed his soul power to come back to life.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">While this could not increase his level of cultivation and was not helpful to his absorption of the origin energy of heaven and earth, this allowed his soul power to circulate non-stop. Soon, his legs regained their feeling</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">After an entire day’s worth of circulation, Huo Yuhao could slowly and awkwardly raise his two legs. Wang Dong’er was so happy that she wept. At the very least, his legs could move! Every energy field in his lower limbs regained its feeling.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">This was only the first day of recovery, and he had already obtained such good results. This made Elder Xuan, Elder <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuang</span>, and Wang Dong’er extremely happy.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Through the circulation of his soul power, Huo Yuhao slowly withdrew the soul power in his legs, and then combined them with the soul power in his meridians. This allowed him to control more than two-thirds of his soul power.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Of course, he could not use his soul power straightaway. His passageways were battered by both the extreme chill of the origin energy of heaven and earth and the extreme heat of the Blazing Sunspring. They were already weak and messed up. All Huo Yuhao was trying to do was establish a foundation in his own body.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">He next started treatment of his arms.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The passageways in his arms had been moderately injured due to the burns on his hands. Even after some self-recovery, they were still chaotic.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">In comparison, the soul power in his arms could not be compared to that of his dantian. It could not even compare to his legs. However, Huo Yuhao had one advantage, which was the advantage of the soul bones in his arms. His left arm had the Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone, and his right arm had the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear's Right Palm Bone.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">With these two soul bones, while the flesh and skin of his hands were severely injured, the bones in his hands were safe. If not, if his bones had melted, he would have become a true cripple.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">It was not easy to open his meridians and remodel them. Actually, it was a very painful thing to do. However, at this point, Huo Yuhao was not fighting alone.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">They had a complete plan for what to do. Under Elder Zhuang’s assistance, Huo Yuhao forced open every single meridian. As blood spurted from his hands and countless wounds appeared, he was able to force them back into their original positions and fuse with his body once more.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">After this was done, Elder Zhuang used his powerful healing soul skills to help Huo Yuhao’s hands recover their vital energy. Then, the elder sent the blood back into his body.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The pain Huo Yuhao experienced throughout this process was nothing. In only a day’s time, he was able to move his hands again, although, due to the interference from his torso’s damaged nerves, his arms were unable to move for now.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The start was good. However, what came next was more worrisome.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">According to the plan, the next step was also the most crucial step. They had to first expel the Fire Poison left in Huo Yuhao’s body by the Blazing Sunspring. Only then could he start the next step of his recovery. Otherwise, if the Fire Poison, which was close to his heart, suddenly kicked in, Huo Yuhao would die.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">How would he take it out?</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">They would open his chest to take the poison out.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">------</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">“Yuhao, are you ready?” Elder Zhuang asked.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">It was morning, and Wang Dong’er helped Huo Yuhao clean his body. He then lay supine on his bed. When she was washing him, Wang Dong’er’s hands could not stop trembling. No matter what he said, she could not be mollified.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The operation today was too important. If it succeeded, Huo Yuhao would make a complete recovery. If it failed…</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">“I’m ready,” Huo Yuhao nodded at Elder Zhuang while smiling slightly at Elder Xuan and Wang Dong’er.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Elder Zhuang said, “There can be no error. If there is, you will die.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Huo Yuhao chortled, “There will be no error. I’m sturdy, and I won’t die so easily. Elder Zhuang, Elder Xuan, don’t worry. Get ready to start. Snow Lady!”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">At his command, a ray of orange light appeared from his forehead. Was that not the Snow Lady?</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The Snow Lady was different compared to before. Initially, she had resembled an infant, but now she had grown up visibly. She looked like a girl who was over two years old. The only thing that remained unchanged were her deep blue eyes.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">“Eeeyaaa! Dad, dad…” the Snow Lady cried out, shocking everyone.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">She, she could talk, in human speech!</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Huo Yuhao said in surprise, “Snow Lady, you can talk?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Snow Lady pointed to Huo Yuhao’s chest and said seriously, “Dad, dad, pain.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Huo Yuhao smiled and shook his head and said, “Daddy is not in pain. I’ll get better soon. In a while, it’ll all depend on you.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The Snow Lady nodded her head vigorously and said, “Dad… Dad, no pain, no fear.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Huo Yuhao chortled and said, “Get ready, I’ll guide you.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The Snow Lady opened her eyes wider &nbsp;and gently nodded her head.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Huo Yuhao’s eyes turned purple. A layer of purplish-gold light appeared, completely enveloping the Snow Lady.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The Fire Poison from the Blazing Sunspring was an extreme form of flame. To heal it, one would need a very powerful form of ice to protect Huo Yuhao’s body. Furthermore, only a powerful type of ice could draw out the Fire Poison. Huo Yuhao’s soul power was mostly in his torso, and hence, he could not use it. The only way to do so was through the Snow Lady.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The Snow Lady floated next to the bed and knelt down next to Huo Yuhao. With her small hand, she slowly touched Huo Yuhao’s bare chest.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">One could see that the center of Huo Yuhao’s chest, particularly the area near his heart, was dark red. The air above this dark red patch of skin twisted and turned.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The Snow Lady’s left hand was pressed at the location between the dark red skin and Huo Yuhao’s heart. The moment her hand touched it, a faint mist appeared. The temperature of the air around it fluctuated quickly. Cold and heat interchanged with each other, and Huo Yuhao’s face turned red and white.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Everyone held their breath. This moment was too important. Due to the extreme nature of the elements involved, no one could save Huo Yuhao but himself.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The Snow Lady slowly raised her right hand. A transparent, icy-cold dagger formed in her hand. Its tip was razor-sharp, and it was pointed straight at Huo Yuhao’s chest.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Wang Dong’er turned her head away, not daring to look anymore. She clutched her fists tightly and in her mind, all she could think about was how she was responsible for it. Yuhao, Yuhao, you have to live!</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The Snow Lady did not make everyone wait long. Everything was calculated with precision by Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The dagger came down.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in"><em>Pu-!</em> The dagger pierced into Huo Yuhao’s chest.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Under the guidance of the Ultimate Ice, the Fire Poison in Huo Yuhao’s body spurted out immediately. A wound about the size of a fist burst open on Huo Yuhao’s chest. Blazing hot blood spurted out.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Elder Xuan and Elder Zhuang were prepared. With his right hand, Elder Xuan was able to direct the ball of burning-hot blood away from the Snow Lady and into a clear blue bottle.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Elder Zhuang’s hands trembled, and an emerald-green halo surrounded Huo Yuhao’s body. An immensely powerful life energy started to rise, and the energy in Huo Yuhao’s body began to increase exponentially along with it.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The Snow Lady’s left hand, which was placed on Huo Yuhao’s chest, started to tremble violently. Most of the Poison was extracted, but some of it became active and rushed toward his heart.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The activation at this moment had been too intense. Even though Huo Yuhao had been prepared, he still felt an intense heat rising in his heart.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">His biggest problem now was that his Ultimate Ice could not protect him. All he could do was rely on the Snow Lady’s power. This was the most dangerous moment. Once the Fire Poison broke through her defenses, he was a goner.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">At this moment, a layer of emerald-green light started to rise from Huo Yuhao’s body. The light was concentrated on a few ribs near Huo Yuhao’s heart. The intense Ultimate Ice energy was channeled outward in unison with the Snow Lady’s power. Together, they expelled the Fire Poison from his body.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">After the incident in the Setting Sun Forest, Huo Yuhao had matured. He also did things more seriously. Like he had said, he would not allow an accident. This was because he still had a trump card, which was the million-year soul ring from the Skydream Iceworm.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Under the Skydream Iceworm’s guidance, the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s Ultimate Ice power was the last line of defense. It was able to protect his heart perfectly. At that moment, the extreme chill caused the circulation of blood in his heart to fall to one-tenth of its normal pace, turning Huo Yuhao’s face white. However, the Fire Poison had been expelled.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">While the Fire Poison had been expelled, it was now up to Elder Zhuang to control Huo Yuhao’s massive outflow of blood.</p>
