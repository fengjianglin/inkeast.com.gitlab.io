 <p><strong>Book 2: Academy of Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 13.2: Mysterious Water Pill</strong></p>
 <p>“Cheating my ass. If you want to bet with me, you have to accept your loss. Give me the Mysterious Water Pill you owe me.” Bei Bei smiled as he used his draconic claw to pour a bit of his lighting-type soulforce back into Xu Sanshi’s body, causing Xu Sanshi’s tall body to tremble all over once again.</p>
 <p>How could Xu Sanshi know that a person in the stands had already fainted solely for the sake of helping Bei Bei beat him?</p>
 <p>That’s right; the piercing pain that Xu Sanshi had felt in his brain when he’d wanted to activate his second and third soul skills had come from Huo Yuhao’s Purple Demon Eyes and Spirit Shock. Even though Huo Yuhao’s cultivation wasn’t that high, the instantaneous attack power generated by the combination of the two skills still made Xu Sanshi, whose body had been completely protected by soulforce, suffer a loss.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had been roughly thirty metres away from Xu Sanshi, which was perfectly within the range of his Spirit Shock.</p>
 <p>Not only that, before releasing these two skills, Huo Yuhao had even used his Spiritual Detection and Spiritual Sharing in order to help Bei Bei find a weak point in Xu Sanshi’s defense.</p>
 <p>It could be said that this short instant was Huo Yuhao’s best performance since becoming a soul master. He’d consecutively used three soul skills, as well as the Purple Demon Eyes, to forcefully direct the outcome of a match between two evenly matched adversaries.</p>
 <p>The scenes before the match—</p>
 <p>The few gestures that Bei Bei had made towards Tang Ya had been meant to tell her to ask Huo Yuhao to help out, and the reason that Bei Bei had unleashed his attacks on Xu Sanshi when he hadn’t received any opportunities was because Tang Ya had told him the range of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing.</p>
 <p>This victory actually belonged to to the combined efforts of both Bei Bei and Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>Other than Tang Ya and Bei Bei, who was in the arena, Wang Dong was the only who’d sensed it. When Huo Yuhao had used his soul skill, although he’d deliberately controlled the soul ring that had appeared below his feet so that it didn’t rise upwards, how could he hide the undulations of soulforce released by it from Wang Dong, who was sitting right next to him?</p>
 <p>Wang Dong clearly saw a faint-gold colour appear in Huo Yuhao’s eyes, which had almost instantaneously turned much more vibrant in the next moment. Finally, a purple light had flashed through them. Right after that, he’d directly tilted towards him, unconscious.</p>
 <p>As Wang Dong subconsciously held onto Huo Yuhao, the match in the arena had already finished.</p>
 <p>“He, what happened to him?” Wang Dong asked with an astonished tone.</p>
 <p>Tang Ya was also startled when she saw Huo Yuhao collapse. She hurriedly examined Huo Yuhao’s condition, before letting out a sigh of relief. “He’s simply overdrawn his soulforce, there’s nothing wrong with him. Let’s go.” It was better to leave the crime scene after doing something bad. Furthermore, Tang Ya was inwardly puzzled. How had the effectiveness of Little Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing been so great? Bei Bei’s original intention had just been to use it to let him take the initiative in the fight!</p>
 <p>Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi’s cultivation level were about the same, so the person who was able to seize a decisive opportunity would have the best chance at victory. However, she never thought that he’d actually win the match in one blow.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was truly too exhausted. After a full day of physical training, combined with the many times that he’d used his soul skills, the over-exhaustion caused him to fall into a very thorough unconscious state, where he wouldn’t be able to wake up for quite a while. This was also one of his body’s self-defense mechanisms.</p>
 <p>Tang Ya and Wang Dong carried Huo Yuhao back to his dorm room together. By the time they reached the dorm, Bei Bei had caught up. After using his soulforce to help Huo Yuhao’s body recover, he took out a porcelain bottle and tumped out a medical pill, which he shoved into Huo Yuhao’s mouth.</p>
 <p>“Little brother, please take care of him.” Upperclassmen weren’t allowed to enter the dormitories of lowerclassmen; this was a rule set by Shrek Academy. Thus, Bei Bei could only ask Wang Dong to help him out.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s gaze was slightly blank. He came from a prestigious family, so he was knowledgeable about many things. Earlier, he had clearly seen the pill that Bei Bei had taken out.</p>
 <p>It had been a dark blue pill about the size of a cherry, with many veins of various shades of white on its surface. When he’d taken it out of the porcelain bottle, the pill had even been surrounded by a faint layer of mist. Furthermore, its fresh smell that had lingered in the air was something deeply refreshing to the mind.</p>
 <p><em>Was that a Mysterious Water Pill? No way.</em> Wang Dong was gobsmacked.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t only him. Even the old man who was lazily reclining next to the entrance widened his eyes slightly for a moment before he returned to his original state.</p>
 <p>Tang Ya asked Wang Dong, “Little cutie, when little Yuhao wakes up, please remind him to go buy some fish tomorrow. When I get back, I’ll prepare another set of what I gave him earlier today.”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei unhappily retorted, “You only know how to eat. You almost harmed my little junior brother today.”</p>
 <p>Tang Ya humphed and said, “Don’t give me that. I know that you already had bad intentions towards Xu Sanshi behind his back. That guy’s as dumb as a rock, so sure enough, he was duped by you. You just happened to grab the opportunity.”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei innocently said, “If someone wants to give me a present, what else can I do but receive it? All I can say is that our little junior brother’s luck is quite good. Let’s go back and cultivate. I remember a certain someone who said that she’d give me a kiss if I were to beat Xu Sanshi. You should keep your promises.”</p>
 <p>Tang Ya stuck her tongue out at him. “I asked you to beat him until he wasn’t even able to take care of himself. Did you do that? If not, go cultivate!”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong suddenly said, “Senior Tang Ya, please consider my question for a while. I really want to join the Tang Sect.”</p>
 <p>Tang Ya nodded her head and waved at him, while Bei Bei revealed a pondering look on his face. Afterwards, he smiled at Wang Dong before pulling Tang Ya away.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong carried Huo Yuhao back to their dorm room and placed him onto his bed. The image of the pill that Bei Bei had fed to Huo Yuhao was still present in his mind. After softly shaking his head and glaring fiercely at Huo Yuhao, he muttered to himself, “I’m not scared of getting an eye infection after seeing what I wasn’t supposed to see. Sleeping on a hard bed serves you right.” Whilst speaking, he jumped back onto his own bed and started meditating in a cross-legged position. The physical training that he’d undergone today had also been extremely effective.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s sleep this time around was especially sound. Ever since he’d entered the Tang Sect, he’d been bitterly cultivating the Mysterious Heaven Technique. This was the first time since then that he’d been able to sleep peacefully.</p>
 <p>In his dream, he felt as if he was immersed within a relaxing pool. The ensuing feeling of relaxation caused him to let out a moan.</p>
 <p>Not long after starting his meditation, Wang Dong opened his eyes once again and looked—astonished—towards Huo Yuhao, who was still lying on his bed. He’d been roused after sensing the strong fluctuations of soulforce in the air.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, the strong fluctuations of soulforce he’d felt were being emitted from Huo Yuhao’s body. It was already nighttime, so the faint blue light that was coming from Huo Yuhao’s body was especially noticeable in the dark.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong jumped down from his bed and squatted quietly beside Huo Yuhao’s bed to carefully observe him. He discovered that Huo Yuhao’s skin seemed to be rising and falling slightly. Furthermore, as it rose and fell, a few tiny streams of air were being continuously emitted from his pores. These were the fluctuations of soulforce that he’d sensed. Furthermore, the faint blue mist surged unceasingly into his pores before surging back out and, following the passing of time, the colour of the mist gradually turned slightly darker. At the same time, the refreshing smell in the air gradually weakened.</p>
