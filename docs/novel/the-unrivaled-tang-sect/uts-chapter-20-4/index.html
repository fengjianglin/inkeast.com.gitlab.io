 <p><strong>Book 3: Fusion of Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 20.4: The Body Soul's Secret</strong></p>
 <p>“Uh… I forgot. I’ll try hugging you again.” Huo Yuhao suddenly felt somewhat embarrassed, but he immediately hugged Wang Dong even tighter.</p>
 <p>When Wang Dong was hugged with even more strength, he couldn’t help but let out a light groan. He wanted to push him away, but he still decided to endure it. With his hands reluctantly grabbing Huo Yuhao’s clothes and his lips tightly shut, he really looked as if he’d suffered a large grievance.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao slowly gathered his soul power while conscientiously perceiving Wang Dong’s aura, but the first thing he smelled after hugging Wang Dong was the strong fragrance that came off his body. Wang Dong’s body felt somewhat firm, but it was still extremely soft.</p>
 <p>Gradually, Huo Yuhao felt the undulations of Wang Dong’s aura; it was a strong, radiant aura that felt comfortably warm. As it stimulated his soul power to slowly circulate around Wang Dong’s body, it caused an indescribably comfortable feeling. What made him even more astonished was the fact that an even stronger aura of life had gradually appeared in the midst of the radiant aura.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s aura unexpectedly transformed three times in a row, but every change made him feel even more intimate with Wang Dong. When he felt the final transformation in Wang Dong’s aura, his soul power surprisingly started to circulate along the circulation paths of the Mysterious Heaven Technique.</p>
 <p>This, this was...</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao gradually widened his eyes; Wang Dong was similarly astonished. After Huo Yuhao hugged him, a golden stream slowly appeared on the surface of his skin. Then, it slowly turned a bluish-gold colour before turning dark-gold.</p>
 <p>The colour of the light changed three times; this was also a strange undulation that Huo Yuhao felt after his aura transformed.</p>
 <p>In the end, Wang Dong was still more experienced than Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao silently sensed the aura on Wang Dong’s body, while Wang Dong observed everything on Huo Yuhao’s body. He discovered that a light had started to appear on Huo Yuhao’s body. First, it was a dim, white stream that was soft and profound, and even had a diverse feeling to it. When his aura came into contact with this white aura, an indescribable sense of coziness unexpectedly appeared. Huo Yuhao’s aura seemed to be virtuous, and harmonized perfectly with his own aura.</p>
 <p>Following that, the aura on Huo Yuhao’s body began to transform. His soft and profound aura gradually turned chilly, and a faint chilliness appeared on his body. However, that chilliness also felt as if it were filled with an endless amount of life; it merged perfectly with the aura of life on Wang Dong’s body. Although one was an aura of life was one that belonged to the natural world, while the other was an inexhaustible amount of life that came from the desolate cold of ancient times, the endless undulations of life that they shared allowed the two auras to combine with each other, further harmonizing them.</p>
 <p>When the stream surrounding Wang Dong’s body finally turned dark-gold, the aura on Huo Yuhao’s body changed from an icy-blue colour to an insipid grey one.</p>
 <p>This grey was very, very dull. However, to Wang Dong’s astonishment, the profundity and stability that came from the stream of grey surpassed even the dark-gold on his body.</p>
 <p>Yes, the aura on Huo Yuhao’s body had expectedly transformed three times in a row as well. Furthermore, it fused perfectly with Wang Dong’s aura each time it transformed.</p>
 <p>Gradually, Wang Dong’s hands, which were holding onto Huo Yuhao’s clothes, started to rise upwards, hugging him as well. At this moment, there were no distracting thoughts in their minds; they were completely immersed in the wonderful feeling caused by the changes in their respective auras.</p>
 <p>The three different auras varied unceasingly, while the soul power in their bodies started to circulate. Furthermore, the circulation speed of their soul power became increasingly faster as time passed, while the speed at which the three auras alternated continuously increased.</p>
 <p>The differently-coloured streams that unceasingly surrounded the two were faintly discernible; in reality, they were very light in colour, so only the two of them could clearly sense their auras.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the two didn’t understand what this state truly meant to them, but they took advantage of the opportunity that had presented itself and calmly hugged each other, silently perceiving this wonderful and increasingly relaxing feeling.</p>
 <p>Regardless of whether it was Huo Yuhao or Wang Dong, the two of them felt as if the other party had merged into their body; this feeling was simply too wonderful. Subsequently, their souls felt as if they had ascended to a higher plane.</p>
 <p>At this moment, a refreshing feeling appeared in Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea. An extremely familiar voice then echoed out.</p>
 <p>“How can your luck be this good? This can’t be true.”</p>
 <p>This sudden voice startled Huo Yuhao, slightly awakening him from that strange feeling. He subconsciously wanted to release his hands.</p>
 <p>That voice hurriedly said, “Quickly hug him, you idiot.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao immediately tightened his arms. He had an absolute trust towards this voice, because he had already recognised that this voice belonged to no one else but the Skydream Iceworm.</p>
 <p>Yes, the Skydream Iceworm, who had been in a deep slumber for several months, had actually awakened due to Huo Yuhao’s and Wang Dong’s hug.</p>
 <p>However, it quickly turned taciturn. After a brief moment, its voice rang out in Huo Yuhao’s mind again, “From now on, follow my instructions. I’d never have thought that you’d actually be able to find someone who’s completely compatible with your aura. This Brother really can’t understand it. No, this is practically impossible! However, you’ve done it. This, to you, is something extremely fortunate. You have to grab this chance; it’ll give you two endless prospects in the future.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao subconsciously thought in his mind; “Brother Skydream, just what do you mean? Wang Dong’s aura is perfectly compatible with mine?”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm responded; “Simply put, the current relationship between you two is just like that of a married couple between mortals. On the one hand, we have Yin; On the other hand, we have Yang. We have two completely identical auras, but they respectively represent Yin and Yang. After they fuse completely, a completely harmonized body of Yin and Yang will form. As a result of this, you’ll inevitably release an extremely large amount of power. It seems like you humans call this situation a ‘Martial Soul Fusion’. In other words, your martial soul and the martial soul of this fellow you’re hugging are perfectly compatible. Furthermore, there are different levels of martial soul fusions. Generally, the possibility of a fusion only exists if your compatibility exceeds fifty percent. However, the compatibility between you two is a hundred percent. Not only that, but this Brother was even astonished by the fact that you two actually have three martial souls that are fusing with each other. This practically isn’t a miracle, it’s perverted!”</p>
 <p>“Three martial soul fusions?” Huo Yuhao asked blankly. “How can that be possible? Wang Dong only has one martial soul, and that’s the Radiant Butterfly Goddess! I only have two martial souls, and my second martial soul isn’t even decided yet.”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm unhappily said; “Do you think he’s just going to tell you that he has a few martial souls? If it were me, I wouldn’t even talk about it! As for you, not bad. You originally had one martial soul, but I gave you an Ice martial soul. That’s two. But do you still remember that small grey ball? That unfathomable fellow. Even if he looks very weak, don’t look down on him. I’ve thought about him for a long time, but I still can’t swallow him up. He’s unexpectedly become a strange sort of martial soul. Even with this Brother’s million years of experience, I still can’t fathom what he’s doing. It doesn’t seem to be able to obtain any soul rings, but the innate strength of its soul terrifies even me. Even I can’t imagine what it’ll become. But, this martial soul that can’t even be called a martial soul actually managed to fuse with this fellow you’re hugging. Otherwise, why would this Brother be so stunned?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao astonishedly said, “If you put it this way, then doesn’t it mean that Wang Dong has triple martial souls as well?”</p>
