 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But no matter how furious the Sun Moon Empire’s generals and soul engineers were, they would never expect that their War God Empress was feeling very conflicted in this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bastard! You’re such a bastard. How can you say such things in front of everyone? You have to tell me such things in private. Who knows, I might even agree. Do you know that I think of that every passing day, and I would rather be your concubine than this empress!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s heart was trembling faintly, and her breathing wasn’t very balanced. The Fire Phoenix Legion’s formidable individuals beside her thought that she was boiling with fury, and nobody dared to utter a word. They were all waiting for her to give the order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re asking to die, Huo Yuhao!” Ju Zi’s words were almost squeezed out from between her teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But she didn’t know that Huo Yuhao, who was still in the shadows, didn’t feel very good in this moment. Tang Wutong was punishing him angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao used his consciousness to continuously explain to her that he was doing this to infuriate the Sun Moon Empire’s powerful individuals so that he could execute the next step in his plan. Unfortunately, Tang Wutong was just a jealous woman right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? Do you not agree, empress? So what you said about giving me whatever I want means nothing? In that case, I know how to say meaningless words too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you really think that we can’t do anything to you?” Ju Zi said coldly, “Huo Yuhao, do you believe that I can’t give the order right now to attack Shrek City and massacre the entire city? I will annihilate your academy’s ten thousand years of foundations, and I will remove Shrek Academy from the face of the earth for eternity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied coldly, “If you dare to do that, I will do all I can to murder every single person from the Sun Moon Empire, including the empire’s citizens, even if that takes my whole life and my last breath. I will not make any exceptions. I will do that until the Sun Moon Empire’s blood no longer runs through this world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” The Sun Moon Empire wasn’t the only one who was astonished when Huo Yuhao said those words. Shrek Academy’s senior members who had flown into the air in the distance were also in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They finally understood why Huo Yuhao would go to the Sea God’s Pavilion last night to resign, which appeared a little impulsive. He probably wasn’t impulsive at all when that happened, and he already had a plan in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was he saying? He was a Titled Douluo, and he was threatening to make a move against innocent civilians, even though he was targeting the Sun Moon Empire. What did that mean? This meant that he would become a machine of slaughter and murder, and he would become the entire continent’s enemy. He would become an assassin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not even evil soul masters dared to say something like this. Huo Yuhao would become a public enemy to the entire world of soul masters, and everyone would be against him. Not even the Star Luo Empire or the Dou Ling Empire would protect him, because what he had threatened to do was forbidden. This was absolutely forbidden! This was something that couldn’t be tolerated at all in the world of soul masters, and also in the world of soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strong wouldn’t prey upon innocent civilians. This was an unspoken rule that applied especially to Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Titled Douluo’s destructive power was incredible, and killing ten thousand normal civilians within a day wasn’t difficult at all. Apocalypse would descend upon the world, and rivers would run with blood!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Huo Yuhao wasn’t just opposing the Sun Moon Empire when he said those words. He placed himself on opposite ends with the entire continent. He was going against humanity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan was hovering in the air as his facial muscles suddenly twitched conspicuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song stared at Elder Xuan with a stunned look on her face. “Is he really going to do that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan forced a laugh and answered, “The question now is whether or not he will do this. He’s thrown his reputation out the window with his words. I don’t know what he wants to do. It’s no wonder that he wants to relinquish everything he has in Shrek Academy! This child never fails to surprise us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m proud!” Qian Duoduo suddenly chimed in from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er slapped his bald head and snapped, “What are you proud of?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qian Duoduo chortled and said, “Don’t you guys think Yuhao is truly starting to be like an Ultimate Soldier? What is an Ultimate Soldier? An Ultimate Soldier can turn the tide of battle all by himself, even if he’s faced with thousands and thousands of soldiers and enemies. Huo Yuhao is beginning to embody that essence, and that may not be a bad thing. As for what he just said, my fellow elders, have you guys heard anything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Zhuang was the first to shake his head. “I didn’t hear anything. We’re too far away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe heaved a sigh and said, “Yes! I don’t know what’s wrong with my ears nowadays, they’re not working very well. I need to go back and clean them out. Huo Yuhao’s voice wasn’t travelling towards us, and I don’t think anybody in Shrek City has heard anything either. This kid is always mumbling, who knows what he’s talking about?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corner of Elder Xuan’s mouth twitched again. He heaved a sigh as well and said, “I haven’t been drinking wine for a long time, but Yuhao angered me last night to the point that I had a few drinks, to the point where my head is still a little dizzy today. No, I can’t fly anymore. Let me rest on the battlements for a few moments. This kid will never lose, so what are we still doing here? Come, let’s go back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song’s heart was twitching instead.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Damn, you’re an Ultimate Douluo, and you’re saying that you can’t fly anymore. Who will believe that? Do you really believe that yourself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan stared deeply at Elder Song and said, “There are some things that, if you keep telling yourself again and again, you’ll believe in time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire’s army of one hundred thousand fell into complete silence in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The normal soldiers, who were originally detached because this battle of greats was none of their business, suddenly opened their eyes wide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their surveillance soul tools also immediately detected that Shrek City’s soul masters who had flown out were going back. What did that mean? At the very least, this meant in their eyes that Shrek City had given up on Huo Yuhao. He was truly alone in this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi stared at Huo Yuhao, and her eyes were as black as could be. Her feelings were incredibly conflicted and messy in this moment. She had never expected that Huo Yuhao, who had always been kind and goodhearted, would say something like this. Of course, she didn’t believe that Huo Yuhao would do anything to normal civilians, but he was subjecting himself to universal condemnation with those words!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Have I really forced this to happen? Is it because the Dou Ling Empire’s royal family have been completely annihilated in Ling Dou City? Have I forced him to do this? Yuhao!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Ju Zi’s heart softened a little in this moment, and even her wariness towards Huo Yuhao seemed to change a little because of her softening heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you want?” Ju Zi’s voice was still as cold as ever, but she wasn’t as forceful and domineering as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said plainly, “I don’t want anything. I’m all by myself anyway, and I’ll just pit myself against you for all of eternity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t you dare!” Ju Zi roared angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and answered, “You can try, and see if I dare to or not. I’m not using my own life in this wager anyway. There are many people here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s body quivered. “You’re a Titled Douluo, and yet you dare to target innocent civilians. Are you not afraid of the heavens smiting you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “I would rather be struck by the heavens than have my country destroyed. The heavens will smite me, but that will save many lives that I wish to protect. So what if the heavens strike me down?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi seemed a little flustered. “What exactly do you want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took a deep breath as he looked up to the sky. “I am not sure if your trip here to ask the academy to hand me over is your original intention. But since you’ve made that request, then I am here. But catching me isn’t that easy. Why don’t we have a wager in front of these two armies?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wager?” Ju Zi’s lowered guard was immediately raised once more when she heard that word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wager? What does he want to wager on?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Ju Zi stared at Huo Yuhao confusedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you wish to wager?” Ju Zi lowered her voice as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said plainly, “You guys are most afraid of my abilities to conceal myself, and I do not wish to see you destroy my country. Even though I no longer have any ties to Shrek City, I still wish to protect it. We will fight ten battles to determine the victor. I will take on ten people by myself, who will take turns to fight me one-on-one. We will fight to the death, and the winner will continue, while the loser dies! If you guys can kill me in ten rounds, then everything will be over. If I win all ten rounds, then you will withdraw your army, and you cannot attack Shrek Academy within three years. We will execute this wager immediately if you agree, and if you don’t, then be prepared to pay with your civilians’ lives.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi had a sudden revelation. Huo Yuhao had been foreshadowing this for a long time. This was his final goal after pressuring and threatening like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That is so smart! He’s using his own strength and threats to tie down the Sun Moon Empire’s armies. He’s forcing me to finish this wager with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s army of one hundred thousand was watching, and if the Sun Moon Empire didn’t take this wager, that meant the empire didn’t care about their soldiers’ safety. The army would fall into disarray, and as long as Huo Yuhao could create several small incidents and damage, that could lead to an event that the military dreaded most: rebellion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi couldn’t accept that possibility, and neither could her generals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Huo Yuhao had paid with his own reputation to tie the entire Sun Moon Empire army down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, he was still so young, and he still wasn’t an Ultimate Douluo. He wasn’t even a Transcendent Douluo. He had demanded to take on ten people one after another all by himself under such circumstances, so there was no reason for the Sun Moon Empire to reject.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fellow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pressure on Shrek would disappear if the Sun Moon Empire withdrew their army from Shrek City. Subsequently, the army’s plan to move against the Star Luo Empire would likely have to change.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuhao, Yuhao, you have given me a very difficult problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s mind spun rapidly in that short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right in this moment, a voice suddenly appeared in her mind. This voice was very soft, but it was unnaturally clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Evil soul masters are our common enemy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” Ju Zi felt her heart skip a beat. She had never expected that Huo Yuhao could still project his consciousness into her mind with such a formidable linked defensive barrier protecting her. At the same time, she immediately understood what he wanted to do.</span></p>
