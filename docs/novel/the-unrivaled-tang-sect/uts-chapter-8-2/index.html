 <p><strong>Book 2: Academy of Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong> Chapter 8.2: Monstrous Teacher</strong></p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao panted fiercely as he let out a low growl, “Are you going to surrender or not?”</p>
 <p>“Surrender my ass! Let me go!” Wang Dong flew into a rage and forcefully struggled against Huo Yuhao’s grip. However, Huo Yuhao was using all of his strength to restrain him, and had even incorporated his soulforce. Under the circumstances, and considering that he couldn’t use his martial soul, escaping wasn’t easy for him at all.</p>
 <p>“Are you still not admitting your loss? If I’d used a blade earlier, you’d already be dead.” Huo Yuhao didn’t show any weaknesses at all as he let out a low roar. At that moment, while his body was in close contact to Wang Dong’s, he found out that Wang Dong’s body wasn’t only extremely soft, but was also quite elastic. Furthermore, it even had a sort of gentle feeling to it. His body was also unexpectedly releasing a faintly fresh aroma that smelled extremely nice.</p>
 <p>After hearing his words, Wang Dong was stunned. His resistance against Huo Yuhao’s grip instantly decreased. He was right! the stabbing pain in his head and his previous dizziness hadn’t lasted long earlier, but since the two of them had been so close, Huo Yuhao would have definitely had enough time to hurt him if he’d wanted to.</p>
 <p>“I’ve lost. Quickly get off me.” Wang Dong said angrily. His eyes were filled with a look of hate and denial.</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao didn’t release him. Instead, he coldly replied, “The five conditions that you previously set aren’t something that I’m unwilling to do, however, I’m not doing it because of your threats, but because of the respect I have for a roommate. I know that you’re stronger than me, and that I definitely wouldn’t be your match if we were both to use our martial souls. However, remember this: If you dare to humiliate me again, then even if I’m beaten to death by you, I’ll definitely make sure you pay the price.”</p>
 <p>When he saw Huo Yuhao’s increasing viciousness, which got to the point that felt like he was looking into the eyes of a blood-thirsty soul beast, the hate in Wang Dong’s eyes dissipated. What replaced it was a slightly dismayed look. In the field of strength, Huo Yuhao was clearly a lot weaker than him, but in the field of imposingness, he’d completely lost.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao slowly released Wang Dong and stood up. While facing Wang Dong, he retreated a few steps. Then, he turned around, and headed back towards their dorm room.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong sat dazedly on the ground for a while, before finally standing up again. Then, he slowly walked towards their dorm room as well. When he arrived at the dorm’s main entrance, the voice of an old man echoed out, “You have indeed lost. Not just in battle, but even your heart has lost.”</p>
 <p>“Why?” Wang Dong suddenly turned around to gaze at the old man. With an unresigned look on his face, he replied, “I’m clearly stronger than him. If I were to really fight against him, he wouldn’t have even been able to touch me. In which way did he achieve victory over me?”</p>
 <p>The old man pointed towards his own heart, “On the basis of this. He has a fearless heart, while you lack one. Not being afraid of death isn’t something that just anyone can do.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was stunned. After a while, he bowed deeply towards the old man. “Grandpa, thank you for your advice.” After speaking, he walked towards the dorm room with large strides.</p>
 <p>Upon his return to the dorm room, Wang Dong saw Huo Yuhao, who’d already begun to meditate on his wooden bed. He wanted to say something, but in the end, he held it in. After letting out a snort, he made his bed.</p>
 <p>Compared to Huo Yuhao’s poverty-stricken conditions, Wang Dong’s bed was set up with a thick fur mattress that had been made from the fur of some unknown soul beast. It looked thick and soft. Furthermore, he even had a soft quilt. His luggage had already filled the wardrobe beside him, but there were still many things left out on his table. Wang Dong seemed to be too lazy to finish unpacking, instead pulling the quilt over his head to sleep with feeling of injustice.</p>
 <p>Over the following two days, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong minded their own business, and did their own things without bothering one another. The thing that astonished Wang Dong the most was that Huo Yuhao seemed to be in a cultivation state at all times, except for when he was eating. He could faintly sense the strength of Huo Yuhao’s soulforce, but the more he sensed it, the more incredulous he felt. Just by relying on his strength, how was able to beat me?</p>
 <p>The admission period for new students finally ended, and the freshmen dormitory also became lively. Although the rooms weren’t big, they could still fit two people in them. It was very noisy outside, but the sound-proofing abilities of the dorm rooms were very good.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had been cultivating incessantly during these past few days. His previous fight with Wang Dong had inspired him quite a bit. The reason that he’d previously been able to overcome his opponent, and was able to achieve victory, was because he’d relied on the skill that the Skydream Iceworm had given him after awakening.</p>
 <p>Iceworms truly weren’t very strong soul beasts; the four soul skills that the million-year Skydream Iceworm had bestowed on Huo Yuhao weren’t very strong either. They were, respectively: Spiritual Detection, Spiritual Sharing, Spiritual Interference, and Spirit Shock.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was relatively more skilled with the first two skills, and had already verified their impressiveness with Bei Bei. On the other hand, Spiritual Interference was a domain-type skill that could interfere with all living creatures inside a fifteen metre radius of Huo Yuhao, who would produce spiritual undulations. However, the strength of its interference wasn’t high. With his current level of cultivation, the most he could do was make people turn absent-minded for a moment. Furthermore, he wasn’t even able to maintain the skill for a full three seconds; the soulforce consumption was much higher than his previous two skills.</p>
 <p>Spirit Shock was the only skill among the four that had even a tiny bit of attack power. Since it was a single-target skill, the strength of its attack was slightly stronger than the domain-type Spiritual Interference. However, it wasn’t much stronger than it either. The reason that Huo Yuhao had been able to overcome Wang Dong and achieve victory in that fight was because he’d combined Spirit Shock with his Purple Demon Eyes. The combined effect of the two was even better than he’d imagined. Naturally, this was also because Wang Dong hadn’t been able to put up any defenses due to the sudden nature of the attack. If he’d made any preparations, the strength of his Spirit Shock would’ve been heavily reduced.</p>
 <p>However, no matter what way you put it, Huo Yuhao finally had the basic requirements to become a control-type soul master by relying with these four spiritual-type skills. However, his eldest senior brother had previously told him that new students wouldn’t be separated into departments during their first year. Everything could be done after he’d survived their first year.</p>
 <p>“Oi, class starts today. Are you still going to sit there like a fool?” Wang Dong’s voice roused Huo Yuhao from his pondering state. He’d just returned from his breakfast, and was planning to cultivate for a while.</p>
 <p>“Class is starting?” Huo Yuhao asked subconsciously. This was their first conversation after their fight.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong didn’t even look at him as he indifferently replied, “There’s still an hour left.”</p>
 <p>“Oh.” After Huo Yuhao responded, he shut his eyes and began to meditate. After his hard work during these few days, his familiarity with the Mysterious Heaven Technique had increased a bit. An hour was enough for him to circulate the Mysterious Heaven Technique through an entire cycle, which would allow his soulforce to improve by a small step.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong didn’t even listen to his reply. When he turned back to look at Huo Yuhao, he discovered that he’d actually started to meditate again, causing him to involuntarily murmur to himself, “Truly a lunatic.” When he finished speaking, he left the dorm room without even looking back. During these past two days, he’d never seen Huo Yuhao lie down to sleep.</p>
 <p>The large gates of the white teaching area were opened wide, and the new students who were now wearing white-coloured school uniforms walked inside in single file. Everyone’s clothing had the symbol of a small green monster on their left breast pocket, which was the symbol of Shrek Academy.</p>
 <p>Students from different year groups had uniforms of different colours; they had uniforms that were the same colour as their teaching areas.</p>
 <p>As Huo Yuhao rushed towards the new student’s teaching area, he was just in time to hear the ringing of the bell. He rapidly rushed inside and saw the sign for Class 1 on the first room to the left on the first floor, causing him to immediately dash inside without any hesitation.</p>
