 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder it’s the Hand that Protects the Nation. This indeed an extremely strong soul engineer legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao silently compared the Evil Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion to the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion. He immediately felt that this Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion was even stronger than the Evil Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps the difference in their overall fighting strength wasn’t very obvious. However, the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion was better in terms of the details.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he thought, Huo Yuhao immediately flew into the sky. Even if he was discovered, he couldn’t make this trip for nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The oscillation detectors below were scanning everywhere, including the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wove and turned in the sky with the help of his Spiritual Detection, avoiding detection by his enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His motive was simple. He had to at least &nbsp;destroy the batch of aerial surveillance soul tools in the air and cause some damage to the Sun Moon Empire. Furthermore, it would make it more convenient for him in the future if he wanted to spy on this soul engineer legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his expression suddenly changed before he could fly up to the altitude of the aerial surveillance soul tools. As he extended his Spiritual Detection upward to find out the exact location of those aerial surveillance soul tools, they quickly shifted and got into a very weird formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he even had time to be shocked, Huo Yuhao reacted without any hesitation. He continued flying upwards, but in addition, he also burst out in a diagonal direction at full speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, the moment he moved, a huge invisible web fell from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This huge web was made from hundreds of aerial surveillance soul tools. They unleashed soul power undulations from oscillation detectors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul power unleashed wasn’t strong, but it came in streaks and was very dense. When the web fell from the sky, it covered almost the entire sky above the military base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Huo Yuhao felt that things were amiss earlier was because the aerial surveillance soul tools had fallen from an altitude of a thousand meters to five hundred meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something had to be going on if they all fell collectively. He had reacted immediately, and he was right. These aerial surveillance soul tools all contained the ability of oscillation detection, and they bore down as a huge web. No matter how powerful Huo Yuhao was, he couldn’t possibly avoid them all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The undulations couldn’t cause him any harm, but Huo Yuhao soon felt his skin numbing. Without a doubt, he had been locked on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Streaks and streaks of intense red light shone below. Following this, more than fifty beams of piercing red light rose into the sky and shot straight towards him. These fiery-red lights covered hundreds of square meters around him, with him at the center. There was no way he could avoid them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were high-temperature scorching rays, at least Class 5 soul tools. Such rays couldn’t pose any harm to Huo Yuhao, but they were definitely the most rapid attack the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion could unleash in the short-term. Their aim was also very simple. They wanted to stall Huo Yuhao before deploying other attacks against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As these scorching rays shot towards him, more than ten figures had already risen from the base to attack. From their auras, it was evident that they were at least Class 7 soul engineers. One of them was even a Class 9 soul engineer. They were all flying towards Huo Yuhao at the quickest possible speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Damn it! They’re too ruthless!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little depressed right now. However, his greatest potential was always unleashed whenever he was facing danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A layer of icy-jade light emanated from his body. His seven soul rings shone brightly. If the soul engineers from the Sun Moon Empire could see these seven soul rings clearly, they would certainly be astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was one red and four orange-gold rings, followed by another two red soul rings. These were the seven soul rings that Huo Yuhao possessed right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He controlled his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice and unleashed it within a small region. All the scorching rays turned to nothing when they entered this region. The beams of scorching red light only added large patches of mist in the sky, and didn’t serve to stop Huo Yuhao at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned into a beam of flowing light and flew downwards diagonally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he had already been locked on by oscillation detectors. His highest priority was to charge his way out from the region covered by those oscillation detectors. Otherwise, even if he had wings, he wouldn’t be able to fly out of the grasp of the enemy’s top-ranked soul engineers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he completely unleashed his soul power, his Eye of Destiny opened. His soul core revolved quickly, and immense spiritual power shot out from his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spiritual power was very strong. After it appeared, it immediately turned into a spiritual windstorm in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Blast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Blast basically engulfed the entire area spanning a diameter of five hundred meters. It wasn’t targeted at any soul master, but at the oscillation detectors in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual power could generate undulations too. Under the effect of his Spiritual Blast, all the oscillations within this region immediately went haywire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao knew that he couldn’t immediately charge out from the engulfment of the huge web. Those aerial surveillance soul tools were chasing after him based on the direction he was escaping in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the soul engineers below him to stall him, how could he successfully escape? This was why he had to disrupt the enemy’s knowledge of his exact position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At least he had some free room to move about within this region now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, the moment he unleashed his Spiritual Blast, the second round of attacks that was supposed to come towards him from the ground was silenced. An area five hundred meters in diameter was rather large.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao needed to use this limited amount of time he had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body was still positioned diagonally downwards from earlier. He had already quickly put a flying-type soul tool on his back. After stabilizing himself in the air, he immediately burst up like a shell and shot straight up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Go down? The bottom was completely covered; there was an elite force of soul engineers on the ground, and there were even aerial surveillance soul tools forming a huge web in the sky. Huo Yuhao was truly trapped. The only escape route was up. It was only by breaking free from the web that he stood a chance of escaping. Furthermore, the attacks that came from below would also weaken as they moved progressively farther through the air. Huo Yuhao was a Class 7 soul engineer himself, and still possessed a deep understanding of soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only escape route was above.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The aerial surveillance soul tools at an altitude of roughly five hundred meters. Under the influence of his Spiritual Blast, Huo Yuhao wasn’t able to carry out any detection in the region that he was in. However, he unleashed his Spiritual Interference as he shot up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though his Spiritual Interference wasn’t as effective as his Spiritual Blast, it still had some confusion effects under the influence of his earlier Spiritual Blast. After rising a few hundred meters into the sky, he was finally discovered again. However, his exact position wasn’t exposed, even though they could roughly gauge where he was, because of his Spiritual Interference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he was very calm. He had faced more perilous situations on many other occasions. He knew that he needed to remain calm in a situation like this. Only by remaining calm could he increase his chances of survival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He continued to unleash his full strength and didn’t even look at the soul engineers that were pursuing him. Ordinary soul tool attacks couldn’t harm him at all. If advanced-tier soul tools couldn’t lock onto him, their strength was also limited. After all, there were very few soul tools like the Death God that could unleash area attacks with such great and terrifying destructive power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire had discovered his intentions. The aerial surveillance soul tools in the sky started to rise higher and higher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wouldn’t give them such an opportunity. At this moment, he was only a few hundred meters away from these aerial surveillance soul tools. As he flew up, he was already putting another type of soul tool on his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lights started to shine brightly, and Huo Yuhao accelerated amidst strong soul power undulations. During this process of acceleration, he curled his body up, to the point where he resembled a cannon shell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not far from him, the soul engineers were shocked as they pursued him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is that a soul thruster? However, the soul thruster that this person is using is a little too overpowered. Can his body withstand such strong forces?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They didn’t know that Huo Yuhao had already unleashed his Ice Empress’ Armor to protect himself as he activated his soul thruster. Furthermore, he was also very strong, comparable to a Titled Douluo. Even though it was still a little overwhelming, it wasn’t as intense as the soul engineers were predicting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao quickly closed the gap.
