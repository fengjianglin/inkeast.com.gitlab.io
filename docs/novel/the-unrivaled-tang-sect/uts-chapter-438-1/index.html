 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Can I call you that?” Xu Jiujiu asked Huo Yuhao with a smile from where she was sitting in the main seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and replied, “Of course you can, Your Highness. How’s the situation at the front right now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu sighed softly and said, “The situation is not good. The Sun Moon Empire’s defensive strength is unknown to us. They were too sudden with their attack, and paved the way using Class 9 stationary soul cannon shells. They managed to blow up the Ming Dou Mountain Range and create a path. Then, we thought that they were going all-out to attack the Star Luo Empire and quickly pulled all our resources here to resist their onslaught. We even called for reinforcements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But who knew that they had no intention of attacking after some time? It was only then that we realized that things had gone south. When we tried to probe by attacking, the Sun Moon Empire only mounted a defense at the Ming Dou Mountain Range. Their real target has now been verified. They are going for the Heavenly Soul Empire!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We tried to make a breakthrough from this side and help the Heavenly Soul Empire with the burden by targeting the interior of the Sun Moon Empire. However, their defense is simply too strong. We suffered huge losses, and weren’t able to make any advances.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she finished speaking, Xu Jiujiu couldn’t help but close her eyes in pain. The image of the Light of the Death God flashing was still etched in her mind. She and many of the soul masters from the Star Luo Empire were still traumatized by the terrifying strike they had witnessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao asked, “What about the Heavenly Soul Empire? How are they now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu shook her head and said, “I can only confirm that the Sun Moon Empire is attacking them now. We have already sent reinforcements from the Dou Ling Empire over. Furthermore, we’ve also deployed two soul engineer legions to alleviate the pressure they’re facing. We are better able to cope with the burden if both empires are at the front lines resisting the enemy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was shocked, and asked, “Hasn’t there been any accurate information?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been a few days since he had left the army and returned to Shrek Academy. However, the Star Luo Empire had yet to receive accurate information from the Heavenly Soul Empire? Not only did this have to do with their backward communication soul tools, it also had something to do with the intense war that was going on at the Heavenly Soul Empire. It was easy to imagine the Heavenly Soul Empire being under a ferocious onslaught by the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu furrowed her brow and said, “We’ve already sent out ten people, but we’ve yet to get any information. We even sent a Titled Douluo, and I believe we’ll find out some news soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The White Tiger Duke is here!” a guard outside shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone subconsciously stood up. The curtains to the tent were opened, and the White Tiger Duke walked in. There were two others with him… Dai Yueheng and Dai Luoli!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger’s white armor had the same black tiger patterns as his martial soul. It wasn’t clear what material his armor was made of. Huo Yuhao judged it should be made of some special alloy, as soul power seemed to circulate through it. Was it a suit of close-combat armor? In terms of rank, it should be a Class 7 soul tool...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this armor made the White Tiger Duke appeared very suave, Huo Yuhao felt pity for him. As a Marshal of the Star Luo Empire, he could only don a Class 7 soul tool. It showed how far behind the Star Luo Empire was in terms of soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was sizing up the White Tiger Duke right now, and the White Tiger Duke was naturally sizing him up too.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This guy must be leading the team from Shrek Academy, given that he’s sitting beside Princess Jiujiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Princess Jiujiu sent someone to call the White Tiger Duke, he was only informed that representatives from Shrek Academy had arrived. However, he wasn’t informed who they were. Right now, he was disappointed when he saw that they were all youngsters, even though he didn’t express it openly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they were the strong ones from Shrek Academy, the situation might still be able to be reversed. However, what can these youngsters do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, so it’s you!” Dai Yueheng said delightfully. However, he immediately shut his mouth after he finished speaking. He was in a camp, and even in front of his father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke turned his head to look at Dai Yueheng. However, he didn’t reprimand him. Instead, he returned his attention to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Huo Yuhao tried his best to calm himself down, he couldn’t completely maintain his composure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person was his father, and the person he had once hated. However, after a few interactions, he didn’t exact his revenge. Instead, he even saved him twice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had once met the White Tiger Duke during the Elite Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Tournament. It was just that he was still too weak then, and wasn’t noticed by the White Tiger Duke yet. It was his first time meeting Dai Hao directly and face-to-face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What no one noticed was that Dai Luoli’s mouth was slightly open right now, and his eyes were filled with disbelief. He was flabbergasted as he looked at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli immediately recognized Huo Yuhao. How could he not? In addition, he was much more astonished compared to Dai Yueheng. He was much more astonished…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder brother, what games are you playing? Shrek Academy… so you’re actually from Shrek Academy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Huo Yuhao left without bidding goodbye that day, Dai Luoli returned to the camp and was anxious when Huo Yuhao didn’t return. After that, he was reassigned to be by the White Tiger Duke’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, Dai Hao wouldn’t have done that, because he thought that Dai Luoli was better off living a simpler life free of risks if he wasn’t fit enough to inherit the title of the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the appearance of Dai Luoli’s mysterious master caused the mutation and awakening of his martial soul. His cultivation increased by leaps and bounds as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he was already a bit old, Dai Luoli still had potential. The White Tiger Duke had to be unselfish and nurture his own outstanding son! He arranged for Dai Luoli to be brought to his side and let him learn from Dai Yueheng temporarily. As he cultivated, he could learn military skills. He was also given permission to attend some military meetings, which was regarded as training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Huo Yuhao’s attention was all on the White Tiger Duke, and he didn’t focus on his younger brother. He took the initiative to greet the White Tiger Duke along with Xu Jiujiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu smiled and said, “Uncle Dai, let me introduce you. This is the number one talent from the younger generation of Shrek Academy, the one who established the Spirit Pagoda, and the youngest member of the Sea God’s Pavilion, Huo Yuhao! I believe you’ve heard of his name before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her introduction was very detailed, and Dai Hao was immediately shocked. He had naturally heard Huo Yuhao’s name many times before. When the Spirit Pagoda was first established and Spirits first appeared, he had once asked Dai Yueheng whether he knew Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Yueheng recounted his experiences with Huo Yuhao. To Dai Yueheng, Huo Yuhao was a legend. He had become a member of the Sea God’s Pavilion before he was even twenty. What did the Sea God’s Pavilion represent? It was the highest level of Shrek Academy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he no longer underestimated Huo Yuhao because of his age. In the continent, who would dare to underestimate a member of the Sea God’s Pavilion? Moreover, he was also the founder of the Spirit Pagoda!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s rumored that he discovered Spirits. This young man can no longer be described with the world ‘genius’. He’s more like a freak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek Academy didn’t send anyone strong, but his arrival definitely signifies how importantly Shrek Academy regards this war.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Yueheng had once told the White Tiger Duke that Huo Yuhao was possibly the future heir to the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion. In an empire, his current position was like a Crown Prince!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was no longer the rookie he was before. He concealed his emotions very well, and wore a smile as he said, “Greetings to you, Duke. Her Highness was too kind with her words. I didn’t establish the Spirit Pagoda. It was jointly founded by the Academy and the three empires, as well as the savage beasts of the Great Star Dou Forest.”&nbsp;</span></p>

He yearned for his father’s care, and wished that his father was there to protect him and his mother! However, he had never received the love of his father before.
