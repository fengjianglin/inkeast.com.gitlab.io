 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire process of creating the core formation was almost flawless. Huo Yuhao managed to produce two core formations in just one day. Xuan Ziwen believed that he was very talented. However, he knew that he couldn’t possibly create two completely different core formations in one day. In his best condition, it was already remarkable if he could finish one core formation. And after he finished, he would still need some time to rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this kid even human?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How did he even manage to do this? Thirty minutes. I only took thirty minutes to collect dinner. Did he actually manage to finish during those thirty minutes?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xuan Ziwen thought until here, he lifted his head and shouted, “Yuhao, tell me honestly. How did you…” Just as he spoke until here, he realized that the laboratory was already empty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only now that he realized he had agreed to let Huo Yuhao leave. He was instantly frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This rascal knows how to exploit any opportunity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen believed in action. A few minutes later, he appeared outside Huo Yuhao’s room. “Bang, bang, bang!” He started to bang on Huo Yuhao’s door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was the one who opened the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing Xuan Ziwen, she immediately raised her hand to signal him to hush.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was stunned, and softly asked, “Where’s Huo Yuhao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong whispered, “He’s asleep. He seems very tired. He went to sleep immediately after he returned.” As she said, she pointed inside the room and opened the door wide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen took a glance inside. It was true. Huo Yuhao was sprawled on his bed, fast asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like he had overused his brain. For some reason, Xuan Ziwen felt more appeased when he saw Huo Yuhao in this state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forget it, we’ll talk tomorrow.” Xuan Ziwen turned around and left in annoyance. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were in the room together. He had no business being there. Although he was very crazy about his research, he couldn’t possibly drag Huo Yuhao out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong closed the door and walked to the bedside before sitting down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was still a slight smile on Huo Yuhao’s face. He had just returned, and fallen into a deep sleep. He had finished two core formations of a Class 9 soul tool in one day. Even though he had magical carving techniques and the Ghostcarving Blade, as well as his own supernatural spiritual power, it was still a great burden on him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the entire process, Huo Yuhao was very focused. If it were someone else, they would have collapsed. Reading the blueprints were already very exhausting. That was something the Ghostcarving Blade couldn’t help with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just a day, he had finished two core formations. That satisfied feeling supported him, but he couldn’t take it when he came back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong felt a little heartache as she caressed his face and looked his slightly pale face. She lay down close beside him and hugged his waist from behind. She pressed her face against his wide back and closed her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One minute later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bang——"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah——"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I forgot.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone was full of tears!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the second morning, Huo Yuhao went into the laboratory rubbing his head. Even though the bruise that he had sustained the previous night had disappeared due to his amazing recovery abilities, the pain still remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My life is so bitter!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who can I blame? Wutong? She was only trying to get intimate. Blame my father-in-law? I don’t have the guts…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I can only blame myself for being unlucky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His good mood from finishing two core formations instantly dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rascal, you’re finally here. Quickly, start on the third core formation.” Xuan Ziwen hands were on his waist and he jumped in front of Huo Yuhao. This gave Huo Yuhao such a scare that he almost whacked Xuan Ziwen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Xuan Ziwen was a Titled Douluo, he might not be able to survive Huo Yuhao’s hit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher Xuan, can’t you just let me rest longer?” Huo Yuhao revealed a bitter smile on his face as he walked into the laboratory. He then sat down on a chair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen couldn’t be bothered with his condition. He only stuffed the blueprint of the third core formation into Huo Yuhao’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quick, quit the bullshit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao picked up the blueprint, as he was afraid of Xuan Ziwen for some unknown reason, and started reading it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen had been wracking his brains for an entire night, but he still hadn’t discovered what method Huo Yuhao had used to create his core formations. He didn’t even have the slightest of clues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why he had been waiting here since the morning. He was waiting to see how Huo Yuhao managed to create the core formations. He was determined. He had already gotten someone to collect lunch. No matter what, he was going to remain here with Huo Yuhao. He had to see how Huo Yuhao managed to finish such complex core formations in such a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, an entire morning passed, and lunch arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow, it smells great. Let’s eat, let’s eat.” Huo Yuhao put down his blueprint and started to eat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen glared at him. “Are you done with the blueprint?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I’m not done yet. I’m eating first.” Huo Yuhao was eating very soundly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How much longer will you need?” Xuan Ziwen probed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not sure!” Huo Yuhao answered subconsciously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Piak!” Xuan Ziwen slapped his palm against Huo Yuhao’s head, and Huo Yuhao’s face was smacked down into his lunchbox. “You don’t know?” His voice was very high right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao indignantly lifted his head. One side of his face was covered in grains of rice. “Teacher Xuan, what are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was infuriated. “I’ve been waiting for half a day, but you’re telling me that you don’t know when you’re going to be done?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao appeared very indignant, and his eyes were filled with tears. “But I really don’t know! This is a blueprint of a core formation of a Class 9 soul tool. I’m a Class 8 soul engineer. Isn’t it normal that I can’t comprehend it in just half a day?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ugh…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In addition, today’s blueprint is a little more complex. I think I’ll need at least two days to finish it. I might not even be able to finish reading it. I was prepared to ask you about some of the things that I don’t know after I have my lunch.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ugh…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Didn’t you finish two core formations yesterday?” Xuan Ziwen was unconvinced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was more familiar with those two core formations. Furthermore, they were comparatively easier! Today’s core formation is a little more complex. It’s the core of the entire core! How can I understand it so easily? I’m not an immortal.” Huo Yuhao argued self-righteously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Xuan Ziwen didn’t know how to respond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao lowered his head and plucked the grains of rice off his face. He sobbed as he muttered to himself, “I’ve been working so hard, but I’m not even allowed to eat. I even have to sustain a beating from you now. I can’t live any longer. I’ve forgotten everything I read in the morning because of your slap. What should I do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen’s face turned black…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After half a day of being grumpy, Xuan Ziwen eventually pulled his own lunchbox over and started to stuff himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was wide-eyed in shock as he thought to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Has he turned his anger into appetite?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen started later, but ate very quickly. He managed to finish his meal before Huo Yuhao. After finishing, he burped and sternly said, “Continue reading. I’m going out for a walk. Once you understand the blueprint, call me before you start on the core formation. I want to watch you. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, so you just want to see me work on the core formation. You should have said so earlier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen’s face turned black again. He decided to immediately leave this sad and angry place before he was driven mad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only after Xuan Ziwen left the laboratory that Huo Yuhao revealed a smile. He had to accumulate some of the surprise to achieve the greatest effect.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Teacher Xuan, don’t be too anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that he couldn’t finish a Class 9 soul tool in such a short period of time even if he was a genius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took a good three days before he managed to finish reading the blueprint of this third core formation. During this period of time, he received a lot of guidance from Xuan Ziwen. After these three days, Xuan Ziwen was much more appeased. Huo Yuhao’s understanding of core formations still left him rather pleased. At least, he felt that he wasn’t wasting his time teaching him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Draining his energy was actually great for increasing Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power. Many calculations and simulations were needed for the core formations. Huo Yuhao relied on his extraordinary spiritual power to maintain the intensity of his calculations. This was why he could understand the blueprints in such a short period of time. Regarding this, Xuan Ziwen was secretly in awe, even though he didn’t say it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s not easy having such a disciple!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m about to start.” Huo Yuhao looked at Xuan Ziwen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had asked for a rest after he managed to comprehend the blueprint. It was already after dinner now. He adjusted himself and reached his peak state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though this third core formation wasn’t the most difficult of all the core formations, it was still one of the most difficult to create. If he could overcome this hurdle, he would be close to creating a Class 9 soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was even more nervous than Huo Yuhao. Was it possible to create a Class 9 soul tool even if one only had eight rings? At least, nothing like this had ever happened before. How could Huo Yuhao maintain the intricate carvings using his blade for such a long period of time? This was what Xuan Ziwen really wanted to find out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s begin.” Xuan Ziwen said. “Don’t rush, take your time. There are some complex parts where it’s better for you to stop than to rush. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged his words, and placed a square piece of rare metal, which was around fifteen centimeters long, on the laboratory desk. After this, he stretched and shut his eyes. He focused himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen stood to one side and retracted his aura. He was afraid that even a streak of his aura would affect Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Huo Yuhao opened both his hands. There was a sharp look in his eyes. After this…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned his head and smiled at Xuan Ziwen, “Teacher, I’m really going to start.”</span></p>
