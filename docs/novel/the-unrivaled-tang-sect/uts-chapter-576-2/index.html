 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, Ju Zi looked over to Zhongli Wu and asked, “Military supervisor, what do you think about this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu said, “Logically speaking, what they have said is entirely correct. All war spoils should be kept by the empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he finished his sentence, he scanned the Class 9 soul engineers with his cold gaze. The Class 9 soul engineers who fell under his gaze revealed an awkward expression. Even though they were all extremely powerful, they were still a little fearful of the Leader of the Holy Ghost Church.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However!” It was within everyone’s expectation that Zhongli Wu would not stop at that sentence. “Since Huo Yuhao dares to challenge us, he must possess some special abilities. He is known to be adept at concealing himself, and seems to possess extremely powerful fighting abilities. He can also evade attacks from soul tools extremely well. Hence, it might be better for soul masters to go up against him rather than soul engineers. From the soul power fluctuations he has exhibited so far, I don’t think he has become a Transcendent Douluo. After all, he is only a bit more than twenty years old. Among the two items which he has shown us, the short dagger is an ice-type godly weapon. I believe everyone has seen how powerful it is, and I agree that it should belong to the empire. As for the other item, I am certain that it is a spectral creature. It doesn’t have any direct use for our country. I believe that it can only be controlled by the Holy Ghost Church. We are the only ones capable of harnessing its power for the betterment of the empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the Class 9 soul engineers who was formerly addressed by Ju Zi as Elder Su stood out and exclaimed, “Does this mean that our military supervisor plans to keep the war spoils for himself?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu stood up straight as he attempted to intimidate the others with his imposing figure. “Of course I will not be taking the spectral creature without contributing anything. I believe everyone here treasures his or her life a lot. No one would willingly put their lives on the line to fight to the death with Huo Yuhao. In that case, why not allow the Holy Ghost Church to be the main fighting force for the challenge against Huo Yuhao? As long as we can defeat him, it should make sense for us to take away one of the items which are not directly useful for the country. Isn’t that right, Marshal?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not even look the Class 9 soul engineers in the eyes as he turned around to look at Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi looked at Zhongli Wu as a thought formed in her head.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuhao! Yuhao! You have really made a brilliant move this time around! Everything seems to be going according to your plans! It seems like you have predicted what Zhongli Wu would do. If not, you would never have flashed that item to tempt him. In that case, there’s no reason why I shouldn’t assist you to take on our common enemy. However, are you really confident that you can defeat them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Ju Zi thought about it, she nodded gently. “Alright. Since the military supervisor has agreed to take on this responsibility, I shall hand this battle over to him. However, this battle concerns the pride of our army. At the same time, it also concerns the arrangement of our military strategy. Hence, there is no room for failure. Military supervisor, are you ready to receive an official military order?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh?” Zhongli Wu was caught off guard by Ju Zi’s words. An official military order? What was an official military order? When a person did not manage to achieve what was stated in an official military order, he or she would have to be punished by military law. This was something that was usually given only for tasks which were extremely important. Zhongli Wu did not expect Ju Zi to ask him to receive an official military order. It was apparent that she did not want him to lay his hands on the powerful spectral creature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhongli Wu was not overly concerned about receiving an official military order. After all, Huo Yuhao was so much younger than him. He felt that he had been foolish to challenge them. In fact, he believed that it was laughable for him to propose such a battle format. Zhongli Wu felt that Huo Yuhao would not stand a chance against the power of the Holy Ghost Church. If the Holy Ghost Church were to fail, he believed he would have failed as their Leader.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the intense scrutiny of the surrounding Class 9 soul engineers, Zhongli Wu nodded slowly and said, “Sure, I will now take on your official military order. I am willing to be punished by military law if I fail to defeat Huo Yuhao with my people from the Holy Ghost Church!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, under the supervision of the other people in the tent, Zhongli Wu penned down the official military order. Even as the Imperial Tutor and the military supervisor, he could not amend it once it had been issued. No one was exempted from this rule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi nodded and said, “Alright. In that case, I wish you good luck, and that you will return victorious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph!” Zhongli Wu released an angry grunt as he waved his sleeve and left the Commander’s Tent furiously. Following which, the evil soul masters which had followed him into the tent left behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After watching him leave, Elder Su and the other Class 9 soul engineers quickly crowded over to Ju Zi’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Su said, “Marshal, are we really going to allow those evil soul masters to deal with Huo Yuhao? The aura released by the spectral creature is really frightening. Even though we don’t know where it comes from, the Holy Ghost Church will definitely become a lot stronger if it were to fall into Zhongli Wu’s hands!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other Class 9 soul engineers were also visibly worried about the possible disaster that could happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi waved her hand and replied plainly, “Huo Yuhao is a smart person. After all, he is the disciple of Mu En, the youngest member of the Shrek Academy’s Sea God’s Pavilion, and also the Heir to the Sea God's Pavilion. Do you all think that an intelligent person like him would commit to a suicidal situation? Even if a conflict were to occur between him and the Academy, he would never do something like that. Besides, I could tell from the way he conversed with me today how assured he was about his chances. In that case, he must have something up his sleeve to be so confident. Since the military supervisor is so enthusiastic about the whole challenge, I felt that there would be no harm for him to give it a try. After all, he probably doesn’t have enough people to form the ten-man team. If he can’t pull it off, we will figure out a way to solve the problem. And if he were to somehow win, we will also figure something out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing what she said, the powerful soul engineers went silent. Ju Zi’s passive and somewhat conservative attitude was not exactly a bad option for the current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sat quietly on the expansive plains between the Sun Moon Empire camp and Shrek City. The soul power in his body was fluctuating in a sustained and stable manner. However, even though Tang Wutong was standing right beside him, she was unable to detect even a single bit of the soul power fluctuations from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why his two soul cores were so scary. Huo Yuhao was able to rely on his soul cores to compress all of his soul power into tiny spirals in his body. These spirals were the result of a perfect fusion between spiritual power and soul power. His soul cores would only absorb the origin energy of heaven and earth from his surroundings, and would definitely not release any energy easily. Hence, even Zhongli Wu was unable to tell exactly how powerful Huo Yuhao was. He could only make a guess from his breathing that Huo Yuhao had not become a Transcendent Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, Huo Yuhao might not have truly attained the Transcendent Douluo rank. However, he had twin martial souls and a second soul core. His Rank 93 soul power was not something that any other Rank 93 Titled Douluo could match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Icy War God’s Armor was already on his body. The human-shaped soul tool was able to keep all of its essence in its interior, and did not release a single bit of Ultimate Ice aura into the surrounding air. Hence, Huo Yuhao’s surroundings appeared to be frighteningly quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Going one against ten was something that had never happened before in the world of soul masters. Huo Yuhao was like a rash young man who had acted on an impulse after running out of options. Was he really going to end his life in such a violent manner?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On top of the city wall which surrounded Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Elders from the Sea God’s Pavilion had all arrived. The higher-ups from the Tang Sect had also just arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Bei Bei did not know what Huo Yuhao was intending to do. And now, there was already no one who could stop him from continuing what he had planned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya squeezed Bei Bei’s hand and whispered, “Bei Bei, do you think Yuhao can really do it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded fervently. “He can definitely do it. Since he has already suggested it to them, he must be able to do it. We must believe in him. Yuhao definitely possesses the ability to do it. He is only doing all of this to force the Sun Moon Empire army to retreat. He would not have done it if he were not confident of pulling it off. At the same time, he probably wants to take advantage of this battle to take down some of the more powerful individuals within the Sun Moon Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya’s worries did not seem to have lessened by Bei Bei’s words. “However, why do I feel that he is not fully confident that he will be able to triumph over all of them? It feels like he is putting himself into an extremely dangerous situation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan, who was not too far from both of them, overheard what Tang Ya said. He turned his head and nodded. He said, “That’s right. He wants to put himself into a suicidal situation. He wants to be reborn after ‘dying’. I am sure he knows what he’s doing, even though I don’t know exactly what his plan is. However, I believe that improving his own cultivation is one of his objectives.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is this saying that there will be a huge amount of fear when one is placed in a life-and-death situation. Huo Yuhao wants to improve himself by putting himself under immense pressure and fear. He is very different from any other normal Titled Douluo, because he already possesses his second soul core. This grants him the ability to grow and improve rapidly. He is yearning for power to become stronger and change the current situation on the battlefield.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is why he is making this decision. He wants to be stimulated by battle to activate his potential and become stronger. This would definitely speed up the process of him becoming a Transcendent Douluo. I don’t think he has even considered the possibility of failure. On top of that, this is probably not his only objective. He must have made plans for something else too. If he were to successfully triumph over the ten people, he would definitely attain a new level of understanding of his abilities, and become a lot stronger. In fact, he might even be able to push for Transcendent Douluo directly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, only Elder Xuan was qualified to comment about Huo Yuhao. This was because he was the only other person present who had two soul cores. However, Huo Yuhao had formed his second soul core from the Yin Yang Complement technique, whereas Elder Xuan had formed his from the Resonance technique.</span></p>
