It also meant the spear was even superior to his shield! It was a weapon that was even stronger than a Class 9 soul tool?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shrek wins the second individual elimination round!” Zheng Zhan announced the result without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the waiting area, the other six from Shrek Academy were all standing up. They were extremely excited. Wang Qiu’er had crushed her opponents in two consecutive fights. In the second fight, Meng Hongchen didn’t even manage to attack before she conceded defeat. It was a great morale booster for all of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow and gently shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s wrong?” Wang Dong’er asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “How depleted do you think Wang Qiu’er is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er was intelligent, and immediately guessed what he was thinking. “She shouldn’t have used too much in the first fight. Her first opponent was far weaker than her. However, it’s different for Meng Hongchen. Her Vermilion Clear Icetoad was very difficult to deal with. Qiu’er was obviously targeting her strategy. She only had one goal, to kill her even if the depletion of her soul power was great. However, Meng Hongchen was too cunning, and backed out at the last minute.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “She’s indeed cunning. She only conceded defeat after Qiu’er attacked. She couldn’t stop after she unleashed her attack, and it was more like a duel between her and the Titled Douluo referee. While Meng Hongchen lost this fight, she wasn’t depleted or hurt at all. This isn’t a good thing for Shrek later. I just wonder how depleted Qiu’er is. From the strike just now, I believe at least forty percent of her soul power has been depleted.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The accurate number was actually fifty percent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er stood quietly on the stage, a look of regret in her eyes. She had been confident in her attack, but she was duped by her opponent. Although she won, she knew that she had lost to her opponent in terms of tactics. Along with the earlier fight, around sixty percent of her energy had been expended. Even though soul power wasn’t everything for her, who had the Ultimate Strength, the team round would still be affected if she over-exerted herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Dragon Spear was stabbed into the ground in front of her. Two Milk Bottles appeared in her hands. Rings and rings of soul power were undulating around her hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Using two Milk Bottles to restore her soul power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who noticed this scene were astonished by her. No one dared to use two Milk Bottles of the same class at once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She needed to guide the soul power in the Milk Bottles into her body continuously before it could fuse with her soul power. If she sucked in soul power from two sides at the same time, how should she guide it? Even a Titled Douluo wouldn’t do something as crazy as that!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Wang Qiu’er did. She was able to do so because of her extremely strong body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the Sun Moon team’s side, Meng Hongchen left the stage and instructed the next competing member with a few words. After that, she discussed things with Xiao Hongchen and the other members, and gave something to this member before he got on stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Both parties, please step forward and report your names.” Zheng Zhan was already in the center of the stage. The heartbroken look on his face hadn’t faded away yet. The cost of purchasing rare metals to repair the Unbreakable Shield would be an astronomical figure! How could he not be depressed? It was the main Class 9 soul tool that he used!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shrek, Wang Qiu’er!” These three words were destined to be greatly imprinted in everyone’s mind today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, Ding Xiaobu.” This young man from the Sun Moon team was quite short. He was a head shorter than Wang Qiu’er, and was extremely skinny. He was like a skinny monkey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Both parties, please step back and get ready to start.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was squeezing the two Milk Bottles with both her hands. She wasn’t walking very quickly, but slowly taking her time. Her soul power was slowly being restored through the Milk Bottles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Zhan’s lips twisted a little. She was stalling for time! However, he didn’t rush her. He had personally blocked her strike earlier on, which was in fact unfair to her. Meng Hongchen had made a tactical surrender. Under normal circumstances, she should have at least used her Invincible Barrier to protect herself, which would deplete some of her soul power too. However, this was the Sun Moon Empire!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Zhan had earned his reputation based on his fairness, so now he felt a little guilty. That was why he didn’t hurry Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ding Xiaobu wasn’t rushed at all. As he slowly walked back, he seemed to be arranging things on his body. As long as he didn’t retrieve any soul tools, no one could stop him from meddling with his own clothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er took almost a minute to get to her position. She stood straight, turned around and put her Milk Bottles away. Her gaze also started to become more focused. At least on the surface, no one could tell that she was depleted earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Begin!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ding Xiaobu moved. After Zheng Zhan announced the start of the fight, he quickly leapt to one side. He was very deft. Behind him, at least fifteen streaks of lights flashed. All of them were soul thrusters that had been meticulously placed on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An agility-type, close-combat soul engineer?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er also moved. This time, she didn’t unleash all her strength. She pulled the Golden Dragon Spear out of the ground and chased after Ding Xiaobu. She was very quick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ding Xiaobu wasn’t willing to clash with her, however, and started to run in circles. He used the soul thrusters behind him to adjust his speed – sometimes he was quick, sometimes he was slow. He was very agile throughout, and started to play a catching game with Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s gaze turned sharper and sharper. She knew that this was a strategy specifically being employed against her. It was obvious that her opponent had seen through her intentions. In addition, she was the strongest member of Shrek’s team. Her opponent was trying his best to deplete her soul power. It was likely that Xiao Hongchen would be the next from the Sun Moon team to compete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Trying to exhaust me?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er snorted, and suddenly burst forward as she tipped her toes on the ground. She leapt up instantly, and used her Golden Dragon’s Perception to predict Ding Xiaobu’s movements. She also quickly got into position, and her spear turned into a dazzling golden light that stabbed straight towards Ding Xiaobu’s chest. That instant interception, quickness, accuracy and burst of strength was extremely stifling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Ding Xiaobu was prepared, his expression changed as he saw the spear heading straight towards his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One layer, two layers. Two layers of golden light were released from Ding Xiaobu’s body at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spear stabbed him. However, it only raked across his Invincible Barriers. Ding Xiaobu’s Invincible Barriers retracted, and the spear wasn’t able to penetrate through two closely-linked Invincible Barriers immediately. Ding Xiaobu exploited the momentum of the spear to jump back. He made a half turn in the air, and his soul thruster propelled him away from Wang Qiu’er again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Idiot!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er realized what the Sun Moon team had given Ding Xiaobu. They had given him their Invincible Barriers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, was it possible to use two at the same time? This was evidently a special method invented by the Illustrious Virtue Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew how expensive Invincible Barriers were. They gave those who had them a second life! However, even the best Invincible Barriers could only last slightly above ten seconds before they broke down.</span></p>

The Sun Moon team was using money to crush Wang Qiu’er and deplete her abilities.</span></p>

She knew that she couldn’t overcome his defenses before his Invincible Barriers lost their effect unless she used the Throw of Heaven and Earth like she did earlier.</span></p>

He lifted a black cannon to his shoulder before firing a black shell at Wang Qiu’er. The shell blew apart in the air and turned into a huge black web that seemed to be covered in grease.&nbsp;</span></p>

These were the three things the Sun Moon team thought of to deal with Wang Qiu’er. What they wanted to do in this fight was to deplete her as much as possible.</span></p>

She had already won two fights. It would be fine for her to concede defeat to conserve her abilities. However, she needed to beat one more person before she could request to end the individual elimination round and start the team round.</span></p>

For a character as proud as her, how could she allow herself to be led around by the nose by her opponent? The sharp gaze in her eyes flashed repeatedly before she raised her spear.</span></p>

He became slightly tense. As he looked at Wang Qiu’er again, he saw that her eyes had turned completely blood-red.</span></p>

Wang Qiu’er swung the spear in her hands, and two streaks of golden-red light flashed out. The black web coming towards her was destroyed.</span></p>
