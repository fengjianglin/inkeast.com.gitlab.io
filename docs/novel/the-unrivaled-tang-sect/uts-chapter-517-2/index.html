 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, even if she was in a much better state of mind, her body was still affected by the poison. She called herself a funnel before, because she kept losing the life energy that she absorbed from the Life Guardian Blade. However, it was also because of this that she was able to maintain her current condition. Otherwise, she wouldn’t even be able to get out of bed right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei exerted a little more force with his arm and brought Tang Ya closer to him. He was afraid that she would leave him if he wasn’t careful enough. He couldn’t imagine what he would do if that happened. He couldn’t imagine how pained he would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bei Bei.” Tang Ya gently called his name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Bei Bei softly acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya softly said, “Do you think I’m very spoiled? If not for the fact that I left, so many things wouldn’t have happened.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, it’s my fault. I couldn’t protect you.” Bei Bei looked at Tang Ya, and his face was filled with guilt. “If I had understood your thoughts better and showed you more concern, so many things wouldn’t have happened, and you wouldn’t have suffered so much. Xiao Ya, don’t worry, I’ll treat you no matter what.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya smiled and said, “Alright, don’t be like this. Am I not alive and well? If you want to make me happy, you need to be happy yourself. Even if I can’t live much longer, do you really wish to see me in pain even as I draw my last breath? Be happy with me, okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei smiled. “Alright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya brought her face to his and whispered, “Bei Bei, I want to bear you a son, and we’ll name him as a Tang. Alright? Otherwise, the Tang Sect won’t have anymore descendants.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was shocked and immediately responded. “No.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why not? Don’t you love me?” Tang Ya immediately pursed her lips. Although she had recovered her memories, her character had also reverted to her teenage days too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei laughed bitterly. “It’s not that we can’t name him as a Tang, but that you can’t bear a child. Given your current condition…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya shook her head and said, “No, I’m fine. I can do it. My life energy is lacking, but our life energies combined can still produce a new life. He can live on my behalf. How great would that be? If I die and can’t remain by your side, he can be with you. You won’t feel lonely either, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei’s body shook, and tears surged from his eyes. He hugged her tightly as he lost control of his emotions. “No, no, Xiao Ya, I won’t let you die. You must not die. If you dare to die, I’ll accompany you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya caressed Bei Bei’s hair. The look in her eyes was very gentle. “Silly, where can you find someone who doesn’t die? It’s only a matter of timing. I don’t feel indignant at all! You’ve already completed my greatest wish, and you love me so much too. Even though I’ve not lived for a long time, I’ve done what I wanted to. I have no regrets! I only want to bear you a child, alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei couldn’t even answer her. Right now, he was sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bei Bei, Bei Bei.” At this moment, &nbsp;a voice sounded from outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya immediately broke free from Bei Bei’s embrace. Bei Bei also hurriedly wiped away his tears. He was the decision-maker in the Tang Sect. He couldn’t possibly let anyone see him like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi rushed in. Only he was capable of rushing into Bei Bei’s room and making such a huge commotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he entered, he felt something wrong with the atmosphere. He saw the displeased look in Tang Ya’s eyes before he saw Bei Bei’s slightly red eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He coughed. “Have I come at a bad time? Should I come back later?” Xu Sanshi was about to turn around and leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cut the crap. Say whatever you have to say.” Bei Bei snapped. He understood Xu Sanshi’s character very well. From his voice, he could tell that something had happened, and it had to be something good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems like little junior is about to exit his closed-door cultivation. There’s a very strong medicinal smell coming from the laboratory. It’s everywhere now. Do you want to take a look?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen’s laboratory was in the basement, and it was well-sealed. If the medicinal smell could diffuse from the laboratory, it showed how strong the smell was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Xu Sanshi’s words, Bei Bei was also jolted awake. Although he knew that no medicine Huo Yuhao came up with could treat Tang Ya, he still bore a glimmer of hope in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go and take a look!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, it was like as Xu Sanshi described. In fact, when Bei Bei left his room, he could immediately smell the medicine. It was very light, but refreshing. By just sniffing it a little, Bei Bei felt as if his soul power had been stimulated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei thought of something, and said to Xu Sanshi, “Sanshi, quickly call all the Tang Sect disciples and gather at the practice arena. Everyone can meditate together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi had been his partner for many years. He immediately understood what Bei Bei meant, “Yes! Why didn’t I think of this? I’ll go right now. You and Xiao Ya can proceed to the laboratory first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them split the work well. Bei Bei held onto Tang Ya’s hands and quickly rushed towards the basement of the Soul Tool Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The closer they came to the Soul Tool Hall, the stronger the medicinal smell was. Even by sniffing it, they felt extremely comfortable. Even Tang Ya developed a reddish glow on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This medicine is very strong! What kind of medicine has little junior cultivated? It’s actually so strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they came to the entrance of the basement of the Soul Tool Hall, the rest of the senior management of the Tang Sect had already gathered there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go, let’s all go down.” Bei Bei waved to everyone before saying to Na Na, “Na Na, I’ve asked Sanshi to gather the disciples. Whether they’re from the Soul Tool Hall or any other halls, immediately bring them to the basement and gather outside the laboratory after they arrive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The underground laboratory area of the Tang Sect was very large. It could hold a few thousand people at once. There were more than five hundred Tang Sect disciples in the Tang Sect right now, but it was still easy to hold them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Na Na acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rest quickly entered the basement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The medicinal smell in the basement was even stronger. Xuan Ziwen was astonished. “Yuhao is really impressive! What kind of medicine has he cultivated? Just by smelling it, I think it’s more effective than the medicine I consumed last time. We can’t waste it. Quick.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the one who had researched the pill furnace. Naturally, he was very familiar with it. It was a Class 9 soul tool. There was a vent hole that prevented the accumulation of pressure inside the furnace. At times, the pressure would be released. Undoubtedly, this was how the medicinal smell had spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the medicinal smell that diffused in this way was already so good, how strong was the medicine?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the laboratory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao wasn’t the only one cultivating the medicine. Behind him stood Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Huo Yuhao could barely make a Class 9 soul tool, he only had eight soul rings. He couldn’t operate a Class 9 soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he could do so with Tang Wutong’s help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the past few months, he had cultivated with her using his Haodong Power. Their new Haodong Power had fused godly elements, which greatly helped in their cultivation. Furthermore, the fusion of their soul power was getting stronger and stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Tang Wutong’s support, Huo Yuhao could easily pour out the soul power of a Titled Douluo right now. It was definitely fine for him to continue cultivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the entire pill furnace was golden-red. The four vent holes at the top of the furnace would occasionally sizzle and release gas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire laboratory was now filled with the fragrance of medicine. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong could both sense the medicinal smell seeping through their bodies. That feeling was very magical. It felt as if their entire bodies had been cleansed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were about to succeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had been cultivating this batch of pills for a long time. More accurately speaking, this batch of pills contained all the valuable treasures that he had brought back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the past three months, he had cultivated these pills twenty times. According to the different compositions of the medicines, he dispensed them and cultivated them, extracting their essence and removing their impurities. After he finished, he cultivated all of them together to produce this final batch of pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such pills were some of the strongest, according to the records left behind by Tang San. They could even be considered immortal pills, and were collectively known as Qiankun Fortune Pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If not for the fact that Huo Yuhao had ‘cleaned out’ the entire Icefire Yin Yang Well and extracted the essences of the immortal plants around the well, he wouldn’t have dared to try cultivating these pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Class 9 pill furnace was too strong. In his previous attempts, the essences Huo Yuhao cultivated were close to becoming pills. However, the cultivation process was too simple, which caused him to be a little more ambitious. Since he had a Class 9 pill furnace and a complete list of resources, why shouldn’t he try making Qiankun Fortune Pills?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was what he had achieved as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that he didn’t expect that cultivating these pills would be so difficult. When he first started, he only relied on his own strength and that of the pill furnace. However, as time passed, the essences of the resources were quickly extracted. When they mixed together, the amount of power that was released became greater and greater. Even the Class 9 pill furnace was unable to contain so much power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had no choice but to use his soul power to maintain the production process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the first day he started on this batch of pills, it had already been forty-nine days. He managed on his own for the first twenty days. After that, he needed Tang Wutong to help him.</span></p>
