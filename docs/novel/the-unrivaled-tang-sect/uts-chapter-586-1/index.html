 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Huo Yuhao’s first time using the spectral door in the Sea God’s Pavilion. This was really because he didn’t want to alarm anyone. Perhaps leaving just like this was the best choice. He didn’t even know if he could return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He sent Tang Wutong into the spectral demiplane along with the bed before he silently left the Sea God’s Pavilion. He found the Ice Bear King resting in a corner of the academy and sent him into the demiplane to protect Tang Wutong. After this, he left the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xiao Xiao came to Tang Wutong’s room, all she saw was a piece of white paper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, this piece of white paper was in front of Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Xuan, eldest senior, elders and teammates, I’m leaving with Wutong. Wutong is not in a very good condition. None of us know what to do. I’m bringing her to find a physician. No matter what price I have to pay, I must heal her. She’s very important to me. If she can’t recover, I’m afraid that I can’t face this world calmly anymore. Everyone, please take care. Yuhao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He sounded very calm, but everyone could sense the heavy fatigue in his words. They could sense Huo Yuhao’s fatigue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! He had been carrying a lot on his shoulders over these few years. With Tang Wutong around, at least he had a spiritual support. Now that she was heavily injured, Huo Yuhao chose to leave. More accurately speaking, he didn’t leave, but went to seek treatment for Tang Wutong. Her recovery would also determine whether his heart would change for the better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This kid is really pitiful. His heart is too heavy. I hope Wutong can recover.” Elder Xuan shut his eyes heavily. Huo Yuhao had done a lot for the academy. At such a time, who could blame him? They could only wish him well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao silently stood beside Elder Xuan. She also saw what Huo Yuhao had left behind. Although she didn’t know what had happened, there was a resilient look in her eyes right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Go and do what you have to, little brother. I’ll shoulder your responsibilities on your behalf!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Xuan, let me take over Yuhao’s position in the Sea God’s Pavilion now that he’s left.” Ma Xiaotao asked Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one thought that Ma Xiaotao was doing this to usurp power. When the entire continent was in turmoil, power also meant responsibilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan nodded silently. “Alright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao looked at Xiao Xiao and asked, “You are also part of the Tang Sect. Tell me, what happened to Yuhao when I was away?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving Shrek City, Huo Yuhao felt very relaxed. He hadn’t experienced such a feeling for many years. Relief was perhaps the best word to use to describe his current feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leaving everything behind wasn’t easy. However, letting go was sometimes the key to understanding happiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was Huo Yuhao happy? He didn’t know either. But he knew that he was relieved. It was finally time for him to temporarily give everything up. He really wanted to forget everything in this world and just protect Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If not for the fact that she was in a coma, he wouldn’t have made up his mind to do something like this. In his heart, there were still many things he had to do. However, they weren’t important right now. What was more important than Tang Wutong?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lights flashed in the sky as clouds swept past him. Unknowingly, Huo Yuhao was already flying at an extremely rapid speed. His Yin-Yang Complement soul cores seemed to be even more compatible as he was in such a relieved state. They no longer fought each other, but seemed to fuse together through the Yin-Yang Complement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whirlpool-like soul power was generated in his body, and surged before dissipating at high speed. This dissipation was almost nothing to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From Shrek Academy to the Clearsky Sect, the distance wasn’t considered too long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Clearsky Sect was in the Heavenly Soul Empire. More accurately speaking, it was now part of the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was simply too quick. He was so quick that the aerial surveillance soul tools couldn’t find him. But any surveillance soul tool that came within reach of his senses couldn’t escape his clutches.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t even need to use any energy. Ever since he had killed that Class 9 soul engineer, Huo Yuhao had developed a new understanding of the Tang Sect’s Hidden Weapons. It was really like going back to the basics. That feeling was magical. This was why he could still destroy the core formation of an aerial surveillance soul tool as long as he had a small piece of metal, even if the soul tool was thousands of meters away. From there, he could destroy the soul tool completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a very refreshing feeling. Right now, Huo Yuhao was seeking such excitement. This was why any aerial surveillance soul tool he passed was ‘unlucky’. Many of them were destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sun Moon Empire army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi quietly sat in the commander’s tent. Her Sin Memorandum had just been sent back to the Sun Moon Empire’s Radiant City. This time, she had lost, and lost badly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as the army retreated, the remaining members of the Imperial Dragon and Evil Tyrant Soul Engineer Legions returned. Just after they returned, the legion commander of the Evil Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion immediately went to confront the evil soul masters. There were less than three hundred soul engineers left in the two soul engineer legions. However, they were still as hostile as ever. The moment they entered the base, they immediately went to where the evil soul masters were stationed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the evil soul masters were without a head. Zhong Liwu had disappeared, while the evil Transcendent Douluo were either dead or injured. Their overall strength had fallen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A violent confrontation was about to ensue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the other soul engineer legions heard this news, they immediately rushed over to mediate. However, they also turned furious when they learned from the Imperial Dragon and Evil Tyrant Soul Engineer Legions that the Holy Ghost Church had ambushed those two soul engineer legions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t their first day getting annoyed by evil soul masters. This incident caused the entire base to descend into chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Ju Zi wouldn’t be able to handle such chaos in the base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eventual result was that almost all the evil Titled Douluo from the Holy Ghost Church ran away. However, those that were weaker were all torn apart by the enraged soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This issue was blown up. What was the Holy Ghost Church? It was the national church of the Sun Moon Empire! Even if it was an evil soul master sect, it was still a holy church that protected the empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many of the soul engineer legion commanders kneeled down in front of Ju Zi and asked for punishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, was it really possible to punish them now? These soul engineer legions were her supporters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, Ju Zi could only temporarily station the army outside the original Heavenly Soul Empire’s borders. After that, she sent a Sin Memorandum to await punishment from the Emperor. It was only by doing this that she could reach the perfect resolution. Otherwise, there would be a revolt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuhao, you are really vicious! You always claim to be soft-hearted. Aren’t you showing me your toughness this time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one knew who had attacked the two soul engineer legions from the Hand that Protects the Nation, but how could Ju Zi not know? Huo Yuhao possessed both ice-type abilities and the ability to summon spectres. Furthermore, she was the one who had personally told Huo Yuhao that the Sun Moon Empire wanted to attack the Dou Ling Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuhao, you’re really smart. You actually guessed that I was going to carry out an assassination. Although you arrived a little late, you were still able to maintain your composure and use such a tactic to cause internal chaos within my army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, you’ve gotten your way. This time, there’s internal chaos within the Sun Moon Empire. Along with our low morale, we won’t be able to attack anytime soon. Such a good opportunity has gone to waste. There’s also news from the Dou Ling Empire that there’s a surviving member of the imperial family. This member fixed internal problems in Dou Ling City, so things weren’t as bad as they were supposed to be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi refused to believe that these matters had nothing to do with Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuhao, this Yuhao! You are really much more powerful than I imagined. Have you finally matured during the war?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’m not sure whether it’s a blessing or misfortune to have you as my opponent. Yuhao, no wonder I’m interested in you. Even though you’ve caused me a lot of problems, why am I still so happy? Is it because I’ve watched my man mature?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, I’m more hopeful that you’ll become the ruler of the entire continent in the future. If that’s the case, I’ll do my best to help you. Our kid will be your future successor. That’s the perfect ending I hope to see. However, I know that that’s almost impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi locked up all the commanders involved in attacking the Holy Ghost Church. She still had to do what was right on the surface. At the same time, she also convinced them. She was the leader of an army. Now that a problem had arisen, the blame would be attributed to her first. If the Emperor condemned them, she would suffer all the consequences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Marshal, this matter has nothing to do with you. We are the culprits. You are the pillar of our empire. Without you, we couldn’t have wiped out the Heavenly Soul Empire and caused the entire continent to waver. How can we let you take any punishment for us?” A Class 9 soul engineer said agitatedly.</span></p>
