 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Huo Yuhao was fleeing earlier, he wasn’t struck by the attacks of the long-range soul tools that were installed in the Ming Dou Mountain Range. The main reason was that they couldn’t accurately determine his position. Otherwise, the Mad Bull Douluo wouldn’t have intervened. Currently, the furthest attack could only reach thirty kilometers. Of course, this wasn’t considering stationary soul cannon shells. If there were stationary soul cannon shells, a further range could be achieved. However, soul tools must be able to lock onto the enemy first. Their aerial surveillance soul tools were kept close to the Ming Dou Mountain Range as the Star Luo Empire’s troops inched closer and closer, minimizing losses and damages. This was why their control at further ranges wasn’t sufficient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Huo Yuhao came up with his plan, he had already considered everything. This was why he was reinforced by Xu Sanshi at the extreme boundary of the effective range of their ultra-long range soul tools. Even if the ultra-long range soul tools could react in time and fire attacks at them, they would have enough time to escape as the cannon shells traveled towards them. The others were also naturally reinforcing him outside the boundaries of the effective range of the ultra-long range soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So what if there was a Titled Douluo? They were eight against one. Huo Yuhao wasn’t afraid at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the distance, streaks of dark-blue light were also flying towards them at rapid speed. The Evil Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion’s Dagger Section had already reorganized itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, both Wang Yiheng and the soul engineers from this Dagger Section had to keep one thing in mind. They were closer to the Star Luo Empire’s base than the Ming Dou Mountain Range right now. This meant that the Star Luo Empire’s reinforcements might appear at any time. They might even be lying in ambush.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ball of blue light was flung into the air by Wang Yiheng. It transformed into an eyeball-shaped blue light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Dagger Section saw this ball of blue light, they quickly stopped before turning around and retreating. They were rushing back in the direction of the Ming Dou Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fled?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that the Dagger Section had escaped, Huo Yuhao didn’t lower his guard at all. Instead, he became tenser. His Spiritual Detection immediately engulfed all his comrades. At the same time, he quickly drifted forward in front of everyone. Xu Sanshi followed beside him, and the rest rapidly adjusted their formation under his command.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was the furthest forward of the eight. Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan were to his left and right respectively. Tang Wutong was behind him, while Ji Juechen and Jing Ziyan were to her sides. Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu were further back. The eight of them circulated their soul power at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mad Bull Douluo appeared very indifferent. His Empyrean Blaze circulated around his body and took a stereoscopic form. He had turned into a huge bull and raging flames were burning, causing the entire sky to be illuminated fiery-red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t advance further. Otherwise, he might not make it back. Wang Yiheng had already decided that this was going to be his last attack. No matter whether or not he could kill his enemies, he wasn’t going to remain, and would immediately return to the Ming Dou Mountain Range after this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, seven to eight projections rose from the Star Luo Empire’s base. From the speed of their ascension and the lights, it was evident that these people were very strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One strike. He only had the strength for one strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mad Bull Douluo’s seventh, black soul ring shone brightly. In the next instant, he had already turned into a Mad Bull. His Empyrean Blaze was still attached to him, causing him to look like a huge bull that was more than thirty meters tall. He instantly charged towards Huo Yuhao and the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first from Shrek Academy to strike was Ye Guyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her fifth and sixth soul rings lit up at the same time. Behind her, four wings shone brightly. Right now, she truly resembled an angel. Her slender figure moved rhythmically in the air, and her huge Holy Sword turned into glaring lights that instantly detached from her hand and slashed towards the charging bull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her fifth soul skill, Holy Sword, and her sixth soul skill, Angelic Dance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu made her move at almost the same time. The two of them coordinated perfectly with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu’s fifth and sixth soul rings also lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A long, pink sword shot into the sky and attached itself to the Holy Sword. Compared to the Holy Sword, it wasn’t very eye-catching. However, when it left Nan Qiuqiu’s grasp, the pinkish light that it exuded rapidly intensified. The sword was a pink crystal-like entity that exuded mesmerizing yet blurry pinkish lights under the illumination of the Holy Sword’s golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu clasped her hands in front of her. She wore a serious expression on her face as she pushed her hands forward. A spot of pinkish crystal that was the size of a fingernail flew out. When it flew out, Nan Qiuqiu’s aura seemed to weaken a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was her fifth soul skill, Ruby Annihilation Sword, and her sixth soul, Star of Annihilation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two sword lights combined and instantly landed on the bull’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clang!” The Holy Sword was instantly crushed and turned into countless streaks of golden lights that dissipated. Following this, the Ruby Annihilation Sword was also crushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the combination of these two swords still managed to weaken the flames on the Mad Bull Douluo’s body. After this, the Star of Annihilation arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The immense power of Annihilation was demonstrated at this moment. The Star of Annihilation, that appeared to only be the size of a fingernail, caused bright, pink light to be released as it touched the flames. It imprinted itself on the Mad Bull Douluo’s forehead. It was as if a piece of crystal had grown on the Mad Bull Douluo’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pinkish lights continued to grow stronger and stronger. The size of the Star of Annihilation also rapidly grew. During this process of enlargement, it absorbed the flames. The burning flames were completely ineffective against the power of Annihilation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yiheng was also shocked. It was his first time witnessing the strength of Annihilation too. The strength of a mere Soul Emperor was actually able to weaken his Empyrean Blaze and grow at the same time. How was this possible?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Star of Annihilation was Nan Qiuqiu’s sixth soul skill. It was also her strongest soul skill right now. However, it was different from the sixth soul skills of ordinary soul masters. Nan Qiuqiu would drain more than thirty percent of her soul power to unleash her Star of Annihilation once. She even used up fifty percent of her soul power to unleash this particular strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The best way to deal with the Star of Annihilation was to avoid it completely. Although it was very strong, there was one problem with it. It was that it couldn’t lock onto its opponents. It could only fly forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Empyrean Blazing Bull was too huge. Furthermore, Wang Yiheng was a very conceited person. He had no intention of avoiding the strike. Because of this, he was directly struck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The effect of the Star of Annihilation was that it turned the enemy’s strength into its own strength. When it devoured so much strength such that it reached its limit, it would…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” A major explosion ensued. The Empyrean Blazing Bull was rooted to his position before the flames around his body started to intensify. However, he was just releasing flames from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To overcome the Star of Annihilation, Wang Yiheng had no other choice. He could only increase the output of his soul power. Just as he had predicted, the Star of Annihilation could be filled until it was on the verge of bursting even though it was very difficult to get rid of. However, the amount of power released by the Star of Annihilation was extremely great if it were to blow apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu’s abilities weren’t exceptional. However, her Star of Annihilation absorbed the strength of the Mad Bull Douluo. Given this, the Mad Bull Douluo would suffer greatly if it blew apart. The flames that the Mad Bull Douluo released would also weaken significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the two ladies completed their attacks in the air, a sonorous dragon roar sounded. The Dragon God's Slaughter Dance rose into the air once again, fluttering its dazzling, purple butterfly wings. It charged towards the Empyrean Blazing Bull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chose this timing. It was exactly when the Star of Annihilation had blown apart, and the Mad Bull Douluo’s reaction was slightly delayed.</span></p>

When unleashed, the amount of soul power it drained was according to the intention of the soul master who unleashed it.</span></p>

However, Jing Ziyan could use up to eighty percent of her soul power on her Mist Powder.</span></p>

The sky cracked open, and countless streaks of golden light descended from the sky. They were like bolts of golden lightning that struck the Empyrean Blazing Bull’s body. Every attack that landed made the bull weaker. The continuous attacks also caused the Empyrean Blazing Bull to advance at a slower pace.</span></p>

Everyone from Shrek Academy was astonished by what they saw. Tang Wutong had actually conserved some of her power as she unleashed her Dragon God's Slaughter Dance earlier, but she was demonstrating its true power now. It seemed like even a Soul Sage wouldn’t be capable of such a strike. It had to be at the level of a Soul Douluo.</span></p>

He was a Class 9 soul engineer. He didn’t have a great advantage in terms of his martial soul. This was why he resisted this series of attack using his Empyrean Blaze.</span></p>

However, everyone could sense that a great amount of Wang Yiheng’s soul power was robbed during this process of dissipation.</span></p>
