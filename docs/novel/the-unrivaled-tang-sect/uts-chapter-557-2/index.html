 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the news that Huo Yuhao had returned with the Bluesilver Emperor, how could Tang Ya not be happy when she finally had a chance of recovering?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thank you, Yuhao!" After seeing Yuhao, Tang Ya immediately stood up as tears streamed down her face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately said, "Teacher Xiao Ya, there's no need for you to thank me like this. If you and eldest senior brother didn't take me in back then, I wouldn't be here today. Now, I’m going to start treating you. We can catch up after you’ve recovered, okay?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he started to release his Spiritual Detection, and located the Bluesilver Emperor within the Tang Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei walked over to Xiao Ya and hugged her lightly. Right now, the gentle big brother of the Tang Sect was somehow speechless. He had so much love for Tang Ya, and had probably suffered more than she had after seeing her in a miserable state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After waiting for so many years, a healthy Tang Ya was finally going to return to his side. How could he not be elated?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within a short while, the Bluesilver Emperor had entered the hall. It knew Tang Ya was its target the moment it stepped into the ball. Her Bluesilver Grass martial soul was already very weak, even though it was still around. As the Emperor of the Bluesilver Grass, it was naturally able to sense the state of her martial soul.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hello, Bluesilver Emperor!" Bei Bei was finally able to put down his overwhelming emotions and speak again. He bowed before the Bluesilver Emperor with utmost sincerity along with Xiao Ya.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao spoke. "Senior, this is my eldest senior brother, and she is Teacher Xiao Ya. I believe you should have been able to tell that her martial soul has been severely injured. Hence, we need your help. My eldest senior brother has also sworn not to hunt any soul beasts unless he is attacked by them."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bluesilver Emperor nodded and gave a straightforward reply. "Then let's begin with her treatment. We can talk about the rest later."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As it spoke, the Bluesilver Emperor raised its hand, which was made out of thick vines, before shaking it lightly. A blue crystal clear vine floated out and landed in Huo Yuhao's hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had been working so hard to find the Bluesilver Emperor, and had even announced to the entire continent that they were willing to reward the person who could bring the Bluesilver Emperor to Tang Ya. However, all of their efforts had failed until now. The Bluesilver Emperor had finally arrived at the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned around and looked at Bei Bei. "Eldest senior brother, let's find a meditation room and begin the treatment. Bluesilver Emperor, I assume you’re joining us, right?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes, I will also take a look at her." The Bluesilver Emperor nodded. After all, it was very likely that Xiao Ya would be the owner of its Spirit. Hence, it made sense for it to show some concern for her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was extremely easy to find a meditation room in the Tang Sect. They chose a meditation room in the rear courtyard and started to begin their preparations. Bei Bei was in charge of safeguarding the treatment process, while Huo Yuhao treated Tang Ya. The Bluesilver Emperor would supervise the process by the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher Xiao Ya, I need you to sit up straight and cross your legs. Afterwards, relax your body as I try to awaken your martial soul. You will then try to circulate your own soul power. But remember to take it easy and not rush into it, alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya nodded. But she knew it was impossible for her to not be anxious! She was even more hungry for power than before. But she also understood how important it was for her to be calm in such critical moments.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After taking a deep breath, Tang Ya forced herself to calm down as she crossed her legs and sat properly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bluesilver Emperor suddenly raised its hands before lowering them above Tang Ya’s head. Suddenly, a shower of faint blue light landed on Tang Ya’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people in Tang Sect had tried many different therapeutic methods and soul skills, to no avail. However, under the illumination of this blue light, she seemed to have become a lot calmer, and relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya flashed a grateful smile towards the Bluesilver Emperor before nodding at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao moved towards Tang Ya as he held the vine from the Bluesilver Emperor in his hand and injected the pure soul power from his Mysterious Heaven Technique into it. The Bluesilver Emperor vine immediately radiated an intense blue glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya’s small body started to tremble, as though something within her body was resonating with the vine’s aura. Even though the life energy in her body had stopped disappearing because of the Qiankun Fortune Pills, it was no longer increasing. However, at this instant, she felt an inexplicable warmth in her body, as though something was being awakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao increased the amount of soul power injected into the vine, until the Bluesilver Emperor vine exploded with a popping sound. It transformed into countless motes of blue dust, which floated in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, it was time for Huo Yuhao to showcase his powerful control ability. Under the control of his soul power, the dust continued to spread evenly into the air before entering her body through her pores and nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya’s body started to tremble lightly as her skin started to glow with a faint blue color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao let out a sigh of relief. It seemed like everything was going according to plan. Now, the ball was in Tang Ya’s court.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The main use of the Bluesilver Grass vine was to awaken Tang Ya’s own Bluesilver Grass martial soul. Her martial soul had become a lot weaker after its dark parts had been removed. Because the Bluesilver Emperor’s aura was very strong, it should be able to awaken her martial soul and revitalize it. If everything went according to plan, her cultivation and abilities should return to their original states. She would also start accumulating life energy again, and hence be considered as having truly recovered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya held on as she sensed the energy within her body starting to awaken. However, it seemed like the energy which was trying to stir her own energy was a little weak. Even though she could sense it, she was unable to borrow its power to activate her own energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya started to panic! She only had one shot, and if this failed, the outcome was unthinkable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the panic in her heart intensified, she became more helpless. She was starting to lose touch with the energy within her body. As a result, the Bluesilver Emperor's energy and effects started to weaken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, this can't be it!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tan Ya became really anxious as she tried her best to attract the energy. Because of her panicking, the energy from the Bluesilver Emperor started to become messy and convoluted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was also startled by the sight before him. He had been using his Spiritual Detection to monitor Tang Ya's situation. He also became worried after seeing how her energy flow was becoming chaotic. However, no one present could help her! This concerned one’s control over one’s martial soul. It was not something that soul power from external sources could help. It concerned her special relationship with her martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, a blue figure suddenly appeared behind Tang Ya. He raised his arms as several vines swarmed out and wrapped themselves around her body. Following which, his body started to radiate a powerful blue glow as it started to release a powerful aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was not the aura from his soul power. It originated from the martial soul’s bloodline aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Bluesilver Emperor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya’s body trembled violently for a short while before it stabilized. One would be able to see a small blue glow radiating from her dantian. Conversely, the light from the Bluesilver Emperor’s vines was partially concealed by the bodies of the veins, resulting in a mystical sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did it succeed?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned around to look at Bei Bei with excitement in his eyes. He realized Bei Bei was looking at him with hopeful eyes as well. Both of them were very anxious to know the results. It seemed like the Bluesilver Emperor had made a critical intervention at the most crucial moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could sense that this was a successful attempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, Tang Ya’s breathing started to become stable as her body stopped trembling. She started to possess her own soul power fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bluesilver Emperor loosened its vines which were wrapped around her as it returned to Huo Yuhao’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The martial soul in her body has already been awakened. It is truly one of the purest Bluesilver Grass I have ever seen. In addition, she also seems to possess the true Bluesilver Grass royal blood. Thank you, Huo Yuhao. You have helped me find a really good host. If I can really fuse with her and become her Spirit, I am certain we will share a fruitful symbiotic relationship. Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Bei Bei bowed in unison to the Bluesilver Emperor. “We should be the one thanking you. Without your help just now, she would have been in serious danger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya’s breathing finally stabilized as the soul power fluctuations from her body started to become stronger. Even though the increase was not significant, and her current soul power was probably only at the Soul Scholar level, this improvement could be sensed by Huo Yuhao. Bei Bei was also able to sense it through Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Sharing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems like Teacher Xiao Ya will need to cultivate under closed-door conditions for an extended period of time. This time around, I am certain that she will recover all of her soul power after her closed-door cultivation. When that day comes, we will just need to provide her with tonics and herbs to help her get back to her best state. Eldest senior brother, why don’t we get third senior brother to head to the Star Luo Empire instead? You can stay behind to accompany Teacher Xiao Ya.”</span></p>

I think it’s still better for me to head to the Star Luo Empire. I think I will be a lot more persuasive as a member of the Sea God’s Pavilion than third senior brother.

After receiving the letter, Bei Bei immediately left for the Star Luo Empire without resting at all.</span></p>
