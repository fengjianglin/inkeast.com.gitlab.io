 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled and said, “What are you thanking me for? Your body is no longer only yours. It now belongs to all of us. If all seven of us put our minds to the task, I am sure there’s nothing we can’t achieve. However, before you begin, I will recommend that you get the Life Guardian Blade back. Its copious amount of life energy should be beneficial for you. Previously, when Di Tian formed his second soul core with the Yin Yang Complement, he did it next to the Lake of Life, which was full of life energy. I believe it will definitely be of good use.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes lit up after hearing her suggestion.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right! How could I have forgotten about the Life Guardian Blade? Now that Teacher Xiao Ya is starting to recover, she will have no use for it. Instead, it could turn out to be very useful for me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately leapt off the bench and ran out to look for Tang Ya.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The six Spirits stayed where they were instead of following him. After all, he would only be a short distance away from them. It was okay for them to leave his side for a short while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress whispered into the Ice Empress' ear. After hearing what she had to say, the Ice Empress' face revealed a look of disbelief. She turned to look at the Snow Empress and said, "You…"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled as her eyes showed the pride she had in her heart!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Even though I was not able to succeed back then, I must help Yuhao succeed at all costs!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress nodded gently. "Snow Empress, I understand now."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress started to blush. "What do you understand?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress burst into laughter. "I’m not going to say what I understand!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While they were chatting with one another, Huo Yuhao returned with the Life Guardian Blade.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since it had absorbed the Life Gold brought out by the Golden Tortoise, the Life Guardian Blade had transformed into the Life Guardian Sword. Its jade green body radiated dense life energy. After Huo Yuhao closed the door, the entire laboratory was filled with the dense life energy radiated by the sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the life energy was mainly useful for Huo Yuhao, it was also able to nourish the spiritual sense of the six Spirits. Their faces revealed satisfied expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress nodded towards Huo Yuhao and said, “Let’s get ready. I will share my experience with you so that you can avoid making the same mistakes I did. You just have to follow what I say.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was pretty much done with his mental preparation. He was in his best possible form while being nourished by the dense life energy released by the Life Guardian Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After crossing his legs, Huo Yuhao placed the Life Guardian Sword across his knees. He closed his eyes and allowed his soul power to circulate through the Mysterious Heaven Technique’s circulation path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had been stuck at Rank 89 for a fairly long period of time. Even though he had been unable to make a breakthrough, he had not stopped cultivating with Tang Wutong. Hence, he had soul power in abundance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After beginning to circulate his soul power, Huo Yuhao’s body seemed to contain huge waves, which rippled through him. His soul power was extremely viscous, and had a very firm texture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After circulating his soul power for a single round, his soul power started to circulate in endless succession on its own as his spiritual power grew richer and fuller. When his soul power neared his head, it would be attracted by the soul core, revolving and being compressed around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His six Spirits all returned to his body. Li Ya and the Skydream Iceworm were keeping watch over his spiritual sea, while the other four Spirits went to his chest to sense the transformation of his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress’ voice rang out in Huo Yuhao’s head. “Yuhao, the first thing you need to do is extract your soul power from your soul core. You should only leave your spiritual power in your soul core.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged her instructions as he circulated his soul power. He was trying to draw away the soul power compressed about the soul core near his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was not an easy task. After all, there was only so much his body could take. After obtaining his first soul core, it had been helping him to compress his soul power, allowing him to possess more. After drawing out the soul power, it would flood into his passageways. Very soon, his passageways would become engorged, leaving no space for the soul power to go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, continue and do not stop,” the Snow Empress reminded Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Huo Yuhao could sense a slight trembling in the bones around his chest and back. Those bones started to radiate a jade green glow. The huge amount of soul power stored in his body was being absorbed by the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s torso bone. As his soul power entered the torso bone, space was being created within his passageways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was elated after he began to understand what the Ice Empress and Snow Empress were up to. He did not dare to become complacent as he rapidly controlled the compressed soul power which was leaving the spiritual soul core between his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything seemed to be going very smoothly. It was normal for soul masters to expend soul power, especially during battles. &nbsp;Because his spiritual soul core was mainly housing his spiritual energy, his highly condensed spiritual energy was closest to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his soul power was drawn out from the spiritual soul core, his spiritual soul core became a lot livelier. His spiritual sea started to circulate rapidly as his spiritual energy was released.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Usually, the released spiritual energy would naturally attract the origin energy of heaven and earth. This energy would transform into Huo Yuhao’s soul power after it was absorbed into his body. This soul power would then be consumed to make up for the soul power expended earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why soul cores were so powerful. As long as their owner gave them enough time, they could help their owners recover their soul power without requiring them to meditate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was apparent that Huo Yuhao currently did not need his soul core to help him regenerate soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint layer of white light formed over Huo Yuhao’s skin. It was set up by the Skydream Iceworm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Skydream was the one who had the deepest understanding of Huo Yuhao’s body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao first met the Skydream Iceworm, he had fused with it, and made it his first soul ring. Back then, Huo Yuhao was still like a blank piece of paper. Throughout all these years, as Huo Yuhao developed his powers, the Skydream Iceworm had been watching over his development. Hence, he was extremely familiar with his body and its situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the Snow Empress instructed him to do so, Skydream had already done the right thing, which was to draw away Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power and block off all connection between Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core and the surrounding origin energy of heaven and earth. This would prevent the energy from going near his soul core and transforming into new soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This naturally made the spiritual energy released by the soul core a lot stronger. The resistance from its surroundings became the force which drove its circulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that instant, Li Ya also made her move. She wrapped her gentle spiritual power around the soul core to slow down the speed it was revolving at. It was vital for her to suppress it to a small extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, Huo Yuhao was trying his best to extract the compressed soul power from his soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The backlash from the soul core started after Huo Yuhao had extracted more than seventy percent of the compressed soul power. The powerful attractive force of his soul core made the spiritual barrier set up by the Skydream Iceworm tremble. Even though Li Ya was trying her best to restrain the soul core, she only managed to reduce its attractive force by the slightest bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the power of a soul core! Once it was formed, it became the source of the soul master’s power. How could it be suppressed so easily?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was an extremely resilient person. Even though he started to feel some resistance around his soul core, he did not plan to give up or change his plans as he continued to extract his compressed soul power to the best of his ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the moment when the mermaid princess started to show her strength. Instead of slowing the rotation of the soul core, her primary objective was to keep it stable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This would allow Huo Yuhao to fully focus on the extraction of his soul power instead of having to divert his attention to his soul core. An unstable soul core was likely to explode. Even though it had already become a soul core and was fairly resistant, Huo Yuhao’s endless extracting, which did not give it any chance to recover soul power, could still affect the soul core. He was supposed to expend his energy to protect and stabilize it. However, he was fortunate to have Li Ya around to help him with that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm had also greatly enhanced the diversion of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power, as he ensured that his power did not come into contact with his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, no one dared to slack off as they put in their best to ensure the process could proceed smoothly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the minutes ticked away, Huo Yuhao could sense the increasingly intense trembling of his spiritual sea under the pressure from his soul core. It was trying its best to release spiritual energy to replenish the soul power which he had drawn away. In the meantime, Li Ya was doing her best to envelop the soul core and keep it still. The Skydream Iceworm continued to wrap itself around Huo Yuhao's body as it tried to prevent his spiritual energy from coming into contact with his surroundings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the four Ultimate Ice Spirits were more relaxed. The Ice Empress was busier because she was using the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion's torso bone to absorb the soul power being drawn out by Huo Yuhao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the time when everyone could appreciate the true strength of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion's torso bone. It had absorbed close to fifty percent of Huo Yuhao's soul power. Even then, it did not seem like it was reaching full capacity anytime soon. It merely took on a greener color without giving Huo Yuhao a bloated sensation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the help of his six Spirits, it had been relatively easy for Huo Yuhao so far. He had not faced any difficulty or challenge with the entire process.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the torso bone started to absorb more soul power, the soul power fluctuations became greater. This resulted in an increasingly violent soul core. Li Ya was already starting to struggle with it. Controlling the spiritual soul core was the equivalent of facing off with Huo Yuhao's insanely superior spiritual power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yuhao, control your soul core. Slow it down," the Ice Empress advised.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With just a signal from his intent, Huo Yuhao's soul core immediately came under his control. The violent soul core stabilized instantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Ya was released from her task as she took a break in his spiritual sea. Now that Huo Yuhao was busy trying to control his spiritual soul core, he could no longer focus his energy on moving his soul power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he was trying to suppress the innate ability of his soul core. The result of suppressing a soul core was a greater retaliation from it. It would try to put up a fight against the restraining powers placed on it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An incredibly powerful attractive force suddenly formed in his dantian and extracted the last bit of Ultimate Ice soul power from his soul core. This force was naturally provided by the Snow Empress. She had finally made her move!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could sense a rhombus-shaped ice crystal appearing within his dantian. It possessed an extremely strong attractive force, which drew in all of his soul power. During the process of attraction, it was actually able to compress his soul power, just like a soul core!</span></p>
