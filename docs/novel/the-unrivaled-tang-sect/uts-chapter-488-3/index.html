 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao quickly gave his answer as fine, compact scales began to appear on his skin. These scales were diamond-shaped, and even appeared three-dimensional, as the center of every scale protruded up. Under such circumstances, there were many reflections off the surface of these scales, and they made the faint golden light radiating from his body even more brilliant and eye-catching. Huo Yuhao’s formidable aura continued to rise, and every instant gave everyone a kind of frightening pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If we weren’t so used to spending so much time with this fellow, we’d probably think he’s a savage beast in human form!” Xu Sanshi exclaimed in admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take long before Huo Yuhao’s beastly aura finally stabilized. Everyone heaved a sigh of relief at the same time. At least they didn’t have to channel soul power to resist that tremendous pressure anymore. But their eyes quickly widened, because a strange black whirlpool gradually appeared between Huo Yuhao’s eyebrows. Everyone felt their spiritual seas quiver when that whirlpool appeared, and a hurricane of formidable spiritual power was immediately unleashed from within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was released for just an instant, but that instant sent everyone stumbling backwards uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spiritual power was released and withdrawn in a single instant, but it was released again in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t handle it anymore. I’ll step out for a little while.” Xu Sanshi turned and left the silent room with a stifled look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei and the others also walked out with strange expressions on their faces. Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was too strange, and under such circumstances, they were continuously sustaining spiritual shocks. It was more painful than being in a fight, because they couldn’t fight against it, as resisting would likely create feedback shocks to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only person who didn’t leave was Teacher Xuan, who was already a Class 9 soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen stared at Huo Yuhao with his eyes wide, and his mouth hung slightly agape as a look of disbelief filled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That… what is that whirlpool?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others in the Tang Sect didn’t know, because they weren’t at that level yet, but Xuan Ziwen was!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek Academy had wanted to express their gratitude for his contributions to the Soul Tool Department, and several Transcendent Douluo had personally helped him form his soul core. Even though his foundations weren’t very secure, as he barely became a Titled Douluo, and he might be stuck at Rank 91 for his entire life, Xuan Ziwen could have spent his entire lifetime without becoming a Titled Douluo otherwise, given his foundations. If he couldn’t do that, he couldn’t become a Class 9 soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew how difficult it was to form a soul core because he had done it himself. Back then, he felt as if he had died, and he remembered very deeply about how powerful and frightening a soul core was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what was he looking at now? The center of Huo Yuhao’s brow was filled with formidable spiritual power undulations, releasing and withdrawing spiritual power along with his breathing. It seemed like a soul core!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But how’s that possible? He’s just a Soul Sage, so how can he have a soul core? It was very difficult for me to form my own soul core when I was breaking through to become a Titled Douluo. Wouldn’t he have a much harder time forming a soul core as a Soul Sage?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But judging from the spiritual undulations that are coming from the center of his brow, that is a soul core! Gods! Will this fellow give me a very pleasant surprise? No, that’s not possible. Even if his spiritual power is strong enough, he can’t possibly finish forging a Class 8 soul tool like this one. Forging soul tools requires more than just great soul power. A soul engineer also needs powerful soul power to support him. Otherwise, the soul engineer will find it very difficult to complete everything in one go. He also has to be able to use a Class 8 soul tool perfectly in our deal, and a decomposition cannon expends a lot of soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen gradually calmed down as he finished thinking. However, when he felt Huo Yuhao’s spiritual undulations and the undulations from his own soul core, he still discovered some differences. At least, what made him more gratified was that Huo Yuhao’s&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">thing</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;that was similar to a soul core couldn’t compare to his own soul core in terms of overall strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then that is definitely not a soul core. Yes, doesn’t he have that Eye of Destiny? Maybe this is his Eye of Destiny’s unique appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen continued to console himself. He had never heard of a Titled Douluo who could establish a soul core in his glabella!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen finally turned and left as well. Staying in the silent room and continuously resisting Huo Yuhao’s sporadically appearing spiritual power wasn’t comfortable at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was still waiting outside when he came out of the room. Huo Yuhao was still meditating, so they naturally stayed to protect their junior brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher Xuan, don’t you think Yuhao’s aura is a little strange? Why do I not remember him having such formidable spiritual power before? Can it be that he has run into another miracle in the time he’s spent outside?” Xu Sanshi asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou was deep in thought as he nodded and said, “Yes, I don’t remember his spiritual power being that strongl. Furthermore, his soul power seems to have changed. I have no idea where that aura that resembles a Savage Beast comes from, and the golden light radiating from his body doesn’t seem to be coming from his soul power. It goes from in to out, and I don’t know what’s going on. It’s like he himself has turned golden.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen shook his head and said, “I’m a soul engineer, not a soul master. You have to bring these questions to the Titled Douluo in Shrek Academy. Anyway, I don’t care what he’s doing, he’s not leaving unless he can forge a Class 8 soul tool.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi exchanged helpless looks. They still wanted to try to convince Xuan Ziwen, but it seemed like they should dispel that thought to prevent the bitterness of being rejected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao meditated for a shorter time than everyone imagined he would. Two hours later, the soul power undulations from inside the room gradually receded, and a gentle hum that resembled a dragon’s roar was heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This fellow. If he’s done, then he’s done. Why is he calling out?” Xu Sanshi laughed as he chided, and was the first back inside the silent room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he realized something was wrong once he went back in, because Huo Yuhao was still sitting there with his legs crossed and his mouth closed. The dragon hum from his body was still resonating, but the sound seemed to come from his chest. The dragon hum was faint, and it seemed to form a feedback loop with his soul power as it resonated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s happening?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi turned around and glanced at Bei Bei. Bei Bei had a dragon-type martial soul, and if he didn’t know, Bei Bei should know.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Bei Bei’s expression showed the same astonishment. It was obvious that he couldn’t understand anything that was happening with Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was startled when he gradually opened his eyes. His senior brothers and sisters were all here, and even Ji Juechen, the sword maniac, was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen almost wasn’t in time, but Jing Ziyan immediately ran to call him when she witnessed the strange things happening to Huo Yuhao. Ji Juechen was very interested in and curious about any kind of special circumstances, especially when they were happening to Huo Yuhao. Therefore, he hurried over as quickly as possible. But he couldn’t understand anything that was happening, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re all here, eldest senior brother?” Huo Yuhao sprang to his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was completely reinvigorated, and back in his peak condition after more than two hours of meditation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At his current cultivation rank, not eating for a few days wasn’t a big deal. Furthermore, he possessed immense energy from the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, enough to sustain his energy expenditure. Even if he didn’t meditate, his soul power would be continuously rising, as his spiritual soul core’s greatest benefit was that it helped a soul master cultivate all the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen took a few steps forward and came before Huo Yuhao. “Alright, there’s not much time left, and nighttime has come. If you haven’t forged the decomposition cannon before daybreak, then you will stay here with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he suspected that Huo Yuhao already had his own soul core, now wasn’t the time to ask him. Xuan Ziwen was going to wait for him to stay before asking him. From his perspective, Huo Yuhao couldn’t possibly forge a Class 8 soul tool, no matter how prodigious he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “You’re very cruel, Teacher Xuan. You didn’t have to give me such a complicated one, even if you want me to forge a Class 8 soul tool. This soul tool breaches knowledge about space, and you would have stumped me if I hadn’t gained some understanding of spatial power in recent weeks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? You understand something about spatial power?” Xuan Ziwen’s expression was full of disregard. “Do you know what spatial power is? That’s something that only Titled Douluo or stronger individuals are worthy of studying. You little rascal, hurry up if you’re going to do it, and stop delaying. I will be watching from the beginning to the end, so nobody can help you cheat.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He walked behind the working platform as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression immediately calmed down as he entered the are around the working platform, and even his aura seemed to become cool and calm. Xuan Ziwen was very satisfied about that point. Even though his prized student hadn’t been conducting any research into soul tools or forging them in recent months, he didn’t throw away too much regarding forging soul tools. At the very least, Huo Yuhao’s theory and concepts were still sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was just standing there quietly, and he was silent for about thirty seconds as he adjusted his breathing, heart rate, soul power undulations, and even his spiritual power. He allowed every inch of his aura to enter a certain rhythm.</span></p>
