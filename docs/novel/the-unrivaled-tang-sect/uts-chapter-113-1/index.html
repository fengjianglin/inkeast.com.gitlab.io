 <p><strong>Book 13: Life Gold</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 113.1: Heavenquake Axe</strong></p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were both disappointed as they heard Xu Sanshi’s words. If the Mysterious Underworld Displacement could be used when they unleashed their martial soul fusion skill, it would be a great strategy in a team battle.</p>
 <p>“Alright, don’t be like this anymore. At such a young age, the both of you managed to turn the tide in a critical situation. What more do you want? Teacher Wang won’t even allow me to ask you what your martial fusion skill is. However, I saw it that day. Powerful! I would like to try it if there’s an opportunity.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong laughed, “Brother Xu, do you want to try 1 or 2?”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi snapped, “Nonsense, obviously 1. Do you want me to die?” As he spoke till this point, he revealed a dash of craftiness on his face and continued, “Do the two of you want to see what’s going on in the individual round? But you must both fully recover first.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong turned to look at each other, and they could see that they were both starting to become excited.</p>
 <p>The Star Luo National Academy had conceded defeat, and would not be participating in the individual round. That’s why today’s match was between the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy and the Imperial Profound Academy. Although Wang Yan did describe how the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy had competed, they had not seen it for themselves. Furthermore, the individual round wouldn’t take up too much of their time.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao said, “Xu Sanshi, it’s just the three of us?”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi chortled. “Three of us is enough. Why do we need so many people? Bei Bei and Senior Dai are both still recuperating from their injuries. Yuhao, did Senior Ma do anything to you yesterday?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao shook his head and replied, “Elder sister treated me very well.”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi revealed the same look as Wang Dong earlier, “Elder sister? You’re good! Your progress is quick.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao rolled his eyes and said, “Brother Xu, we’ve only acknowledged each other as siblings. She said that if anyone dares to bully me… hehe, you know.”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi shivered. “You’ve benefited. Does it matter whether it’s your elder sister or younger sister? Let’s rush, we don’t have much time left.”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!” Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong and Xu Sanshi crept out of the hotel as they were driven by their curiosity. As members of Shrek Academy and finalists of the tournament, they managed to enter the competition venue through the corridor for team members.</p>
 <p>At this point, the Imperial Profound Academy and Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy had both entered the competition venue too. While they were in the resting area, the attention of the members of both academies were drawn towards the three of them as they approached. The resting area for Shrek Academy was not empty either. Wang Yan was sitting there. His brows furrowed as he saw the three of them walking over.</p>
 <p>“Teacher Wang.” Xu Sanshi brought Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong to the Shrek Academy’s resting area before greeting Wang Yan.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan said, “Aren’t all of you supposed to be resting? Why are all of you here? Yuhao, are you fine?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao shook his head and replied, “Teacher Wang, don’t worry. I have suppressed Senior’s evil fire.” He did not call her elder sister anymore because he did not want to be interrogated anymore. It was best if he said it to everyone once they were gathered.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan said, “Alright then. Since this is the case, let’s all watch together.”</p>
 <p>The three of them sat beside him, and Xu Sanshi asked curiously, “Teacher Wang, what happened yesterday? I only heard that it was an overwhelming victory. How did the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering manage to do it?”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan revealed a bitter smile on his face and replied, “Do you know why I didn’t allow all of you to watch them compete?”</p>
 <p>The look in Xu Sanshi’s eyes changed a little. “Were you afraid of shaking our confidence?”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan was stunned as he replied, “You are smart. However, this is only one of the reasons. Another reason is that there’s no point in watching them compete.”</p>
 <p>His tone became more serious as he continued, “The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy is obviously very prepared for this tournament. Let me clarify this point. Since they are our biggest rival, I have been monitoring them ever since the tournament started, and watched almost every round that they have competed in. But do you know what I discovered? They have never used the same strategy in each round of the competition, especially during the team matches. Tell me what’s the point of watching them then? It’ll only shake your confidence.”</p>
 <p>“Their team leader, Ma Rulong, competed yesterday. He was impeccable. He used 2 Class 7 soul tools to suppress the entire Imperial Profound Academy. The other 6 simply used Soul Tool Fortresses. Think about what kind of scene you will see when 6 Soul Tool Fortresses are fired at the same time. The entire competition stage was raging with attacks. The Imperial Profound Academy was forced off the competition stage by the frightening firepower before they could even display their true abilities. Their soul emperor was struck the moment he stepped forward and was knocked out of the competition stage. The competition ended after that.”</p>
 <p>After hearing Wang Yan’s description, Huo Yuhao’s and the other two’s expressions changed. Although they had expected them to dominate, they didn’t expect them to be so dominant! If this was the case, how would they fight?</p>
 <p>Wang Yan continued, “After seeing yesterday’s team match, I think that it doesn’t matter anymore. We’ll just do our best in the final.”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi asked in a low voice, “Teacher Wang, do you think our main team members would have a chance if they came to participate in this tournament?”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan replied after pondering for a while, “It’d be difficult for them.”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi heaved a sigh of relief and said, “Since this is the case, don’t think too much about it anymore. Didn’t you mention before that we’ve already completed our mission by making it to this stage? Whether we win or lose in the future, we’ve earned it. Since we only have one round left, so what if we lose, as long as we give our all? Moreover, it’s not our first time creating a miracle. We are Shrek!”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan smiled and said, “You are quite open-minded. I will be relieved if all of you carry such a mentality when you compete. Regardless of whether it’s the academy or me, we won’t bother too much about the result. But if we lose, the public’s opinion will bear on all of you. As all of you are still young, I’m afraid that you won’t be able to bounce back from the setback. If that happens, I will be a sinner in Shrek’s eyes.”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi laughed. “No way! Teacher Wang, you are thinking too much. The academy gave us this chance because we are all determined and resilient. Furthermore, we can just return to the academy immediately if we lose. Don’t tell me that there will be people in the academy who will spout gibberish?”</p>
 <p>As they spoke, the referee had already arrived on the stage. The Star Luo Emperor was also here to observe the competition on top of the city wall. Princess Jiu Jiu, who lost to them yesterday, was also standing beside the Star Luo Emperor.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao could sense someone observing him, and he lifted his head subconsciously. He saw Princess Jiu Jiu glancing at him. Her ravishing face seemed to be filled with frustration, but this could only be noticed by Huo Yuhao because of his Spirit Eyes. The others beside him didn’t notice this.</p>
 <p>On top of the city wall.</p>
 <p>“Brother, I’m indignant. We were supposed to be able to win.” Princess Jiu Jiu protested.</p>
 <p>The Star Luo Emperor smiled and said, “What’s there to be indignant about? It’s a fact that you lost.”</p>
 <p>Princess Jiu Jiu was unconvinced as she said, “But I didn’t get to use my strongest skill.”</p>
 <p>The Star Luo Emperor said, “But it’s not that you didn’t want to use it. Furthermore, it might not have changed the result even if you had. Even if Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong didn’t unleash the soul skill that suppressed the Starcrown, do you think that all of you could have defeated that Phoenix together? Ma Xiaotao’s martial soul is the Evil Fire Phoenix, and she’s the descendant of Ma Hongjun, who belonged to the first generation of Shrek’s Seven Monsters. She’s a Rank 67 soul emperor, and her cultivation is the best among everyone in this tournament. You saw what happened yesterday too. Even when 3 soul kings teamed up together, they couldn’t challenge her. Would all of you have won if you were tired? And that would be even worse in the individual round. All of you had no chance with Ma Xiaotao and Dai Yueheng around. It’s still about the difference in power. While Shrek Academy did not send its strongest lineup this time, no one can underestimate their foundation. I am excited to see how things will pan out when that young fellow grows up 5 years later.”</p>
 <p>Princess Jiu Jiu snorted and said, “I don’t know how it’ll be like 5 years later, but they’ll likely leave this tournament in the humiliation of failure. The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy is too powerful. They have also prepared very sufficiently for this edition of the tournament. Shrek Academy has also appeared with problems. Even if their entire official team competes, they may not have a chance at all.”</p>
 <p>The Star Luo Emperor laughed and said, “Younger sister, you are too concerned about the result of this tournament. The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy is like you, taking this tournament too seriously. At the same time, both you and the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy are taking fame and fortune too seriously. That’s why you reckon that the Shrek Academy has made a wrong move. In reality, I think they are doing what they are doing because of a deeper meaning.”</p>
 <p>Princess Jiu Jiu was puzzled as she asked, “Deeper meaning?”</p>
 <p>The Star Luo Emperor asked in a low voice, “Jiu Jiu, what do you think about our Xu Family’s powers?”</p>
 <p>Princess Jiu Jiu, who was also called Xu Jiu Jiu, replied without any hesitation, “We are very powerful. We were only able to lead the empire’s troops to force our enemies out and disintegrate the Duke’s Mansion bloodline to become the leader of this empire because of our family’s power. It’s very rare to see huge clans like our Xu Family in the continent now. Even when the Martial Soul Hall behaved atrociously then, they couldn’t do anything to us.”</p>
