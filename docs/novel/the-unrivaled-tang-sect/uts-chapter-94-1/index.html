 <p><strong>Book 12: The Strength of the Preparatory Team</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 94.1: The Ice Empress Awakens</strong></p>
 <p>An evil, dark-red light emerged from his Soulsucking Bell, which then transformed into a series of halos. They immediately slammed struck Bei Bei, who’d just finished using the Tyrannical Emperor’s Thunderous Domain.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei’s entire body trembled violently when he was struck, and his eyes turned blank. Shangguan Can then pointed towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong, and Bei Bei unexpectedly turned around and shot straight towards them.</p>
 <p><em>A spiritual control-type soul skill? Shangguan Can actually has a soul skill like this?</em></p>
 <p>Considering how powerful Bei Bei’s martial soul was, his spiritual power definitely wasn’t weak! Yet, Shangguan Can had still been able to temporarily take control of his mind. This greatly startled both Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the hypnotized Bei Bei was only able to follow his instincts; he couldn’t display the finesse he usually possessed when he fought clear-headed. Furthermore, he was currently in a weaken state from using the Tyrannical Emperor’s Thunderous Domain.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao suddenly stopped in midair as Wang Dong flapped his wings, which caused him to fly backwards a few meters, Bei Bei in tow. Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong then hugged each other tightly.</p>
 <p>On the one hand, you had Huo Yuhao, whose Spirit Eyes began to emit a faint-gold color, while on the other, you had Wang Dong, whose beautiful wings had been entirely unfurled as he released his Radiant Butterfly Goddess.</p>
 <p>When they hugged each other and released their martial souls, the ten or so meters around them lit up as a special sort of light blossomed from their bodies.</p>
 <p>As blue, purple, and gold light began to fill their surroundings, and Wang Dong’s complete and gorgeous Radiant Butterfly Goddess folded its wings forwards in a hugging motion.</p>
 <p>At the same time, an enormous, faint-gold vertical eye appeared behind Huo Yuhao, its pupil filled with boundless purple light.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s Radiant Butterfly Goddess violently ignited with a bluish-golden flare of light as it approached the Spirit Eye. When the two images of light finally fused in midair, they suddenly swung downwards.</p>
 <p>The Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence.</p>
 <p>The fused colors of blue, purple, and gold instantly cut out a flat path atop the tournament stage.</p>
 <p>The person who bore the brunt of their blow was Bei Bei. Afterwards, the ray of light continued forward, and struck the paralysed Ye Wuqing. However, Shangguan Can had sensed an opportunity to flee out of the attack’s range.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had no other choice but to do this, as Bei Bei had almost used his Thunderous Dragon Claw against them. If they were delayed by Bei Bei, Ye Wuqing would be able to recover from his paralysis, and they would have no chance of winning this match at all. Thus, he could only choose to do this. The purpose behind Wang Dong’s shift in location had been to make sure that Bei Bei and Ye Wuqing were in a straight line.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei let out a muffled groan as his body was transformed into a golden statue. His Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon instantly collapsed, as was also the case for the distant Ye Wuqing. However, he was able to snap out of his paralysis at this moment.</p>
 <p>After releasing his fusion skill, Huo Yuhao didn’t dare to waste any more time. He took a sudden stride forward, then used his right hand to pat Bei Bei before shooting straight towards Ye Wuqing. At this moment however, Wang Dong didn’t continue to follow him. The remnant soul power that they had left was now in Wang Dong’s body, and before he left, Huo Yuhao removed the Milk Bottle from his neck and shoved it in his hand.</p>
 <p>As his soul thruster activated, Huo Yuhao shot straight towards his opponent like a bolt of lightning. There was only Ye Wuqing in his eyes now.</p>
 <p>A Soul King who had lost the use of his martial soul was merely a soul master who possessed slightly more powerful soul power. Thus, how would he be able to withstand Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice? Moreover, the only way they could win this match was to defeat Ye Wuqing first before doing anything else.</p>
 <p>After being touched by Huo Yuhao, the traces of gold on Bei Bei’s body receded. However, he immediately fell straight towards the ground.</p>
 <p>The Golden Road could cause one’s martial soul to collapse, but it also possessed a powerful erosive effect. After using his Tyrannical Emperor’s Thunderous Domain to block Ye Wuqing’s most powerful attack while draining as much of his soul power as he could, Bei Bei was like a lamp whose oil was nearly extinguished. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been so easily controlled by Shangguan Can. Right after that, he had to suffer the corrosive effects of the Golden Road. Although Huo Yuhao had quickly dispelled the effects of the fusion skill, Bei Bei directly fainted due to overexertion. As Wang Dong held the Milk Bottle in his hands, he looked towards the charging Huo Yuhao with a complicated look in his eyes. At this moment, he was inwardly screaming a single phrase: <em>You can’t, you can’t use a soul tool!</em></p>
 <p>Ye Wuqing currently resembled a golden man. Although he had Rank 58 soul power, he had drained an utterly enormous amount of it during his battle with Bei Bei. How could he not panic after losing the use of his martial soul? He would need a period of time to dispel the negative effects of the Golden Road.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Huo Yuhao arrived in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Even if I don’t have a martial soul, can a Soul Grandmaster like you threaten me?” Ye Wuqing said arrogantly. He sent his right fist flying through the air to meet Huo Yuhao’s attack. A ball of soul power condensed into a white light, which then used his fist as a conduit as it flew out.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao once again used the Ice Empress’ Pincer as he sent his palms forward to meet Ye Wuqing.</p>
 <p>After controlling Bei Bei, Shangguan Can had seemingly fallen silent. However, he was actually focused on absorbing the soul power provided by a Milk Bottle, and he paid no attention to the current situation of the battle.</p>
 <p>“Peng--” Huo Yuhao’s body turned sluggish. His Ice Empress’ Pincer broke through his opponent’s soul power, but the powerful impact from that collision forced him to screech to a sudden stop. All of the soul tools he had now had been used to increase his speed, and even if that wasn’t a case, a Class 2 attack-type soul tool wouldn’t be able to pose a threat to a Soul King!</p>
 <p>The soul paralysis ray? Huo Yuhao no longer had the support of the Haodong Power, and he didn’t have much of his soul power left. As a result, he didn’t dare to use it in an extravagant manner!</p>
 <p>Clenching his teeth, Huo Yuhao used the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track to flash towards Ye Wuqing in an illusory manner. A majority of his hidden weapons then flew out rapidly.</p>
 <p>Ye Wuqing was immediately overjoyed after he saw that Huo Yuhao had been blocked by his attack. He urged the soul power in his body outward, causing a layer of white mist to penetrate his body and form a protective barrier. After all, Huo Yuhao didn’t possess a high enough cultivation, so his hidden weapons would simply be unable to break through his defenses.</p>
 <p>The gap between Rank 27 and Rank 58 was simply too large. Even if Ye Wuqing was temporarily unable to use his martial soul, and his cultivation wasn’t even a third of its usual peak, Huo Yuhao wouldn’t be able to shake him easily.</p>
 <p>Seeing that his opportunity to win was disappearing, Huo Yuhao started to panic. He finally couldn’t endure it any longer and cried out, “Ice Empress, help me!”</p>
 <p>If this were a normal time, the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion would definitely have ignored Huo Yuhao’s request. Both she and the Skydream Iceworm needed an expert who would be able to cultivate their way to becoming a God.</p>
 <p>This was the only way that would allow them to break away from the restraints imposed on them by the world. If they were to blindly help him with everything, how would he truly grow?</p>
 <p>However, this was clearly different. Both the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress had been infected by the Shrek’s Seven Monsters’ attitudes of sparing no cost for Shrek’s glory.</p>
 <p>In the next moment, Huo Yuhao’s aura suddenly changed.</p>
 <p>He didn’t undergo the violent transformation or visual differences that Xu Sanshi and Bei Bei had gone through when they releasing their hidden powers. However, the current Huo Yuhao was much more terrifying in Ye Wuqing’s eyes.</p>
 <p>While using the Ice Empress, Huo Yuhao’s eyes would occasionally flicker with a jade-green light. This was a natural phenomena caused by the appearance of that particular martial soul. At this moment, however, his eyes turned a penetrating color of jade, making it seem as though his eyes were precious gems that sparkled with light.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s body was instantly taken over by the Ice Empress. The voice of the latter rang out in the depths of Huo Yuhao’s soul, “Watch carefully. You have to be adept at using every bit of strength that you have, and you need to diligently train your control over your strength. If you want to defeat the strong while being weak, the only technique you can use is control.”</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress didn’t use the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track; she shot directly forward, and the tattoo of the Ice Empress on Huo Yuhao’s back turned extraordinarily bright and clear. However, his body emitted no traces of chilliness at all.</p>
 <p>Ye Wuqing felt his heart thump as he sensed the sudden changes in Huo Yuhao. At this exact moment, the effects of the Golden Road vanished.</p>
 <p>Overjoyed, Ye Wuqing’s first reaction was to once again release his martial soul to block Huo Yuhao. As he releasing it, he didn’t forget to send a punch out, causing an even more condensed ball of soul power to stop the advancing Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao raised his right hand; to put it more accurately, the Ice Empress raised Huo Yuhao’s right hand. She pointed a single finger towards the incoming ball of soul power, then gently tapped it.</p>
 <p>The white ball of soul power paused distinctly for a moment, then slowed down. The Ice Empress then used the back of Huo Yuhao’s hand to swipe at it, causing it to unexpectedly fly away. However, the speed of Huo Yuhao’s advance didn’t slow in the least.</p>
 <p>Ultimate Ice wasn’t just able to freeze humans; it was also able to freeze soul power! It was just as the Ice Empress had said--everything depended on one’s level of control.</p>
 <p>The speed of Ye Wuqing’s movements wasn’t slow either. With a flash of light, his soul rings started to rise from his feet.</p>
 <p>At this moment, however, Huo Yuhao suddenly felt his entire body go dark. Right after that, he couldn’t see anything else as he directly fell into a deep sleep.</p>
 <p>From the point of view of the audience and the two teams within the waiting area, a strange transformation had suddenly occurred in Huo Yuhao’s body. A jade-green pillar of light that was as thick as an arm suddenly shot out from his chest. The instant this pillar of light shot out, everyone was able to see that Huo Yuhao’s vertebrae, sternum, and ribs were emitting an intense jade-green light, even though his body was covered by his clothes.</p>
 <p>In the next instant, this jade-green light fell on Ye Wuqing.</p>
 <p>The jade-colored light flashed and disappeared right after that.</p>
 <p>Ye Wuqing was a Rank 58 Soul King! At this moment, however, his face only had shock on it. After that, Huo Yuhao’s charging figure struck his body.</p>
 <p>Ye Wuqing didn’t resist at all as his entire body was forcefully knocked backwards. Just like Yan’er, he directly fell off the tournament stage with a crash. However, Huo Yuhao also fell down. Unlike Ye Wuqing, who fell off the stage, however, the place he fell was still a part of the stage.</p>
 <p>This was the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s four hundred thousand year soul skill, Ice Empress’ Wrath.</p>
