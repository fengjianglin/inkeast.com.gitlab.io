 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this, things were much easier. He used his Instant Teleportation and sent the real Eye of the Asura behind Feng Ling. Following this came his second strike of Spiritual Shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Huo Yuhao had really wanted to, he could have really hurt Feng Ling by tapping into the strength of his Spiritual Reaving earlier. After that, he could even kill her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he didn’t do so. Instead, he sealed Feng Ling’s senses and spiritual sea before capturing her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He slowly landed on the ground. There was a strange glow in his eyes. After two consecutive fights, it seemed like he had won very easily. In fact, only he himself knew that he had to react very quickly during these two fights. He had to rely on his strengths to win these two fights easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the start until the end, Huo Yuhao didn’t conserve his strength at all. This was because he knew that the more he didn’t want to unleash his soul power, the more he would be drained. He still had more fights after this. The recovery speed of his twin soul cores and the amount of soul power he had was unimaginable. However, even so, he couldn’t possibly last ten rounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why he didn’t kill Feng Ling. Instead, he grabbed her and gave himself some time to recover. Also…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he landed on the ground, Huo Yuhao took lifted his visor. He grabbed Feng Ling with one hand and had no intention of relaxing at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu stood where he was and didn’t move. Feng Ling was already in Huo Yuhao’s hand. Even if an Ultimate Douluo were here, he couldn’t possibly save her from his hands. Once Huo Yuhao unleashed his Darkgolden Terrorclaws, he could tear Feng Ling’s neck apart in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you want?” Zhong Liwu asked coldly. They were clever people. He wouldn’t demand that Huo Yuhao release Feng Ling. Since Huo Yuhao didn’t kill her, it meant that there was room for negotiation. He had to have some kind of agenda. To Zhong Liwu, Feng Ling was very important. Not only was she his right-hand man, but she was also his wife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil soul masters weren’t devoid of emotions! This was even though Zhong Liwu didn’t control Feng Ling using emotions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to exchange her for your other Holy Lady. I’ll leave it up to you to decide whether a Holy Lady or your vice-sect leader is more important.” Huo Yuhao revealed his demands simply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, he had been waiting for this moment for a long time. He couldn’t find where the Holy Ghost Church’s headquarters was. This was why he couldn’t find Ma Xiaotao at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long ago, Huo Yuhao attempted to use his Spiritual Detection to search for her before when they first entered Radiant City. However, he didn’t find any trace of her. Since he couldn’t find her, he could only turn to the Holy Ghost Church.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Huo Yuhao’s demand, Zhong Liwu focused his gaze. “Keep daydreaming.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he had first captured the two Holy Ladies, he had used the Holy Ghost Church’s methods to stimulate them and rapidly increase their cultivations. After that, the Bluesilver Holy Lady Tang Ya was captured by Huo Yuhao and the others. This left them with only the Fire Phoenix Holy Lady, Ma Xiaotao. Zhong Liwu had high hopes for Ma Xiaotao. She was close to becoming a Transcendent Douluo. Furthermore, she had an Ultimate martial soul! The evil energy of her Ultimate martial soul became fuel for her Ultimate Fire under the stimulation of the Holy Ghost Church’s special methods. Her abilities had grown significantly over the past few years. She was bound to become a pillar of the Holy Ghost Church in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Zhong Liwu’s plan, Ma Xiaotao could become an Ultimate Douluo in a decade’s time. Once she succeeded, she would completely lose her own awareness and become a puppet, a puppet who was an Ultimate Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, even though both Ye Xishui and Long Xiaoyao would eventually pass away, the Holy Ghost Church would still remain strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why Zhong Liwu immediately rejected Huo Yuhao’s demand the moment he mentioned Ma Xiaotao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had feelings for Feng Ling. However, his feelings weren’t important compared to the future of the Holy Ghost Church. This was the Holy Ghost Church’s motto – profit was the most important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you saying that you don’t want her life anymore?” Huo Yuhao lifted Feng Ling high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sharp, dark gold blade shot out from his index finger, shining brightly. The tip of it came extremely close to Feng Ling’s throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop!” Zhong Liwu shouted furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was conflicted! He couldn’t bear to watch Feng Ling die. It was his first time regretting this mission. If he hadn’t personally requested to fight this battle, Wu Yun wouldn’t have died, and Feng Ling wouldn’t have fallen into Huo Yuhao’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the Vampire Ice Bear King was precious, he was still not worth it compared to two Transcendent Douluo! Zhong Liwu subconsciously clenched his fists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Sect leader, you can take some time to consider. I’m not in a rush either. I have ten rounds to fight. I can’t wait to get some rest.” He pointed out his weakness, and even did it with a grin on his face. He wasn’t afraid that Zhong Liwu wouldn’t buy his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu’s breathing became a little heavy. He was very aware that the generals of the Sun Moon Empire army were all looking at him from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had already given a military order. If he failed, his reputation in the army would fall dramatically, even if he wasn’t dealt with according to military laws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was now caught in a bind. What should he do? All sorts of ideas rose in his mind. He really didn’t know what to do right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t bear to give Feng Ling up. However, he was even more unwilling to sacrifice the Fire Phoenix Holy Lady!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu’s expression turned grim as he took in a deep breath. “I can’t pass the Fire Phoenix Holy Lady to you. She’s already one of the pillars of the church. Even as the sect leader, I have no right to exchange her for Little Feng. If you are willing, I can make her fight you next. You can use your own abilities to snatch her away. If you can do that, I’ll have nothing to say. However, I can’t directly pass her to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s a promise.” Huo Yuhao answered without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A cold light flashed across Zhong Liwu’s face. He waved towards the back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A terrifying aura swept over immediately. The cries of a phoenix sounded following this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was different from the cries of Feng Ling’s phoenix. Feng Ling’s phoenix cries were sharp and shrill, whereas this phoenix cry was filled with dominance. It was extremely domineering! It rocked heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mighty aura exploded into the air. Scorching air currents surged. One person slowly walked out from the Sun Moon Empire crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She wasn’t very quick, but every step she took left a fiery-red footprint on the ground. Fiery-red light shone from her without dissipating at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was wearing a red hat with a veil that covered her entire head. That mighty yet scorching aura exuded from her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao focused his gaze and stared at her.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is that you, elder sister?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was unknown what that red hat was made of. It didn’t appear to be damaged even as it was subjected to the scorching air currents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu turned around and walked towards a bunch of soul engineers. He gritted his teeth before grabbing another Class 9 spiritual defensive-type soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, it was a bracelet. He returned in front of that person in red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person in red lifted her left hand. Her palms were milky-white, but there were red air currents coming from them. Intense soul power undulations originated from her body, which couldn’t be suppressed at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her scorching aura made her seem like a volcano that could erupt at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu gave her the bracelet. After this, he turned to Huo Yuhao and said, “She’s here. You can let go of Feng Ling now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao coldly replied, “How do I know if she’s the one? Ask her to lift her veil and reveal her true appearance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu nodded and gestured at the lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lady lifted her veil. When she revealed her appearance, Huo Yuhao’s pupils shrank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All these years, he had done his best to find Ma Xiaotao. However, he couldn’t find her. Now that he saw her, his heart sank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao was still Ma Xiaotao. Her appearance had not changed at all. Time also didn’t leave any marks on her beautiful face. However, her eyes had changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her eyes had turned completely red. Whether it was the black or white part of her eyes, everything had turned red. It was even a deep red. It was as if blood could seep out of her eyes at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she lifted her head and looked at Huo Yuhao, there was only a strong killing intent and terrifying evil energy coming from her eyes.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sister Xiaotao, I was the one who harmed you! For various reasons, I couldn’t leave with you when we first met. After that, we were attacked by the Holy Ghost Church’s Third and Fourth Elder, which caused Qiu’er to sacrifice herself. After Qiu’er sacrificed herself, Shrek Academy was struck by the beast wave. I had no choice but to return to Shrek. When I returned, I could no longer find any traces of you.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao saw her years later, today, he could clearly sense that she had lost a part of her soul. She had become a killing machine controlled by the Holy Ghost Church.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s killing intent grew instantly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Holy Ghost Church, Holy Ghost Church!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An icy-cold look flashed across his face. He stared at Zhong Liwu. A cold smile appeared on Zhong Liwu’s face. He turned to Ma Xiaotao and said, “Kill him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were so many people around. Huo Yuhao couldn’t renege on his words. Huo Yuhao shook his right hand before he flung Feng Ling towards Zhong Liwu. At the same time, Ma Xiaotao was already like a ball of intense flame as she charged towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The air immediately distorted due to the heat. Ma Xiaotao seemed to have gone crazy. She opened her arms wide and shot a phoenix-shaped, dark-red flame towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She immediately used her fourth soul skill, Phoenix Skywhistle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao’s phoenix flames were much stronger now compared to before. Her Ultimate Fire was mixed with some kind of terrifying energy that Huo Yuhao couldn’t even recognize. The flame was aimed straight at him. Ma Xiaotao’s nine soul rings instantly rose at the same time.</span></p>
