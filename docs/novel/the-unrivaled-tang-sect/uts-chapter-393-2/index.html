The clouds gradually dispersed, revealing a colossal blood-red eye.</span></p>

These undulations descended onto the forest from thousands of meters up in the sky and expanded outward, with the Evildemon Forest’s core region as the epicenter. The spiritual undulations covered an ever-larger area of effect, almost two-thirds of the entire Evildemon Forest.</span></p>

The wheel of light behind his head that had formed when he faced off against the hundred-thousand-year Evileye Tyrant glimmered once more.</span></p>

Afterwards, the lush green in that region melted away just like that…</span></p>

A dense and grievous will traveled out from that place as powerful emotional ripples blanketed the entire forest, and countless soul beasts cried out and teared up as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The area that was just bombarded by that terrifying red light began to lose all those red hues, and not a single soul beast would dare to enter that region for a month.</span></p>

His entire body was covered with a layer of dirt, and his appearance was completely obscured, while his clothes were conspicuously torn and tattered... but he was alive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sighed at his own luck.</span></p>

He had formidable spiritual power, but he currently felt as if his entire spiritual sea had been sucked dry. His body was soft and weak, and he struggled to even continue standing up straight. His entire body was in a bad state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, he was still alive; still alive after taking a hit from the Evil Emperor, who had eight hundred thousand years of cultivation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How unimaginable was this? The Evil Emperor, who had just unleashed that attack, had no reason to expect that this human was still alive. When he had discovered Huo Yuhao with his Spiritual Detection, he could already tell how strong he was. From the Evil Emperor’s perspective, this attack was enough to obliterate Huo Yuhao from the face of the earth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Evil Emperor’s arrogance meant he couldn’t be bothered to check the aftermath. Furthermore, he was in the most crucial time of his closed-door cultivation, so he didn’t have the time and energy to investigate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm’s hopeful words from back then clearly didn’t come true. The Evil Emperor wasn’t far from the limit, but he wasn’t there, after all, and he was still alive. He was the Continent’s second strongest savage beast as long as he was still alive, and one of the most frightening existences on the Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It feels great to be alive!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh inside. “You’ve saved me yet again, Qiu’er.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason why he was still alive naturally wasn’t because he had enough strength to withstand that all-out attack from the Evileye Tyrant King. How could the Evil Emperor’s spiritual sweep have any judgmental errors?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason why he was alive was because of the skull bone that he had obtained from Wang Qiu’er, the Auspicious Beast’s skull bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Auspicious Beast’s skull bone possessed a special ability besides bestowing two powerful soul skills upon Huo Yuhao. This ability was called Spiritual Immunity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could make himself immune to all kinds and levels of spiritual attacks three times a day. Unless Huo Yuhao was faced with a God who had the ability to change destiny, Huo Yuhao could render himself immune to all sorts and levels of spiritual attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had relied on this ability, which was basically against natural law in the spiritual realm, to challenge the hundred-thousand-year Evileye Tyrant. He had used this ability to gain the advantage against his adversary in a perilous battle, and had eventually managed to kill it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could use Spiritual Immunity three times when he was in peak condition. After using this ability once, he would have to replenish his skull bone with spiritual power through his own cultivation. Of course, he could use another method to replenish his skull bone – he could consume other skull bones, just like how he had consumed the hundred-thousand-year Evileye Tyrant’s skull bone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao would need at least a month to fully replenish his skull bone to three instances of Spiritual Immunity if he didn’t consume any skull bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual Immunity didn’t seem like much when one considered that one month was a very long time. But in reality, this ability was very useful to Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao had had to use Spiritual Immunity to defend himself against a spiritual-type attack at his level of spiritual power, so just how powerful did that attack have to be?</span></p>

No matter how powerful the Evil Emperor was, Spiritual Immunity had still protected Huo Yuhao from its attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao also had sufficient experience through this attack that not everything was absolute. The Evil Emperor’s attack didn’t kill him, but his spiritual sea was immediately sucked dry in that instant, and even his skull bone was sucked dry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt very fortunate that his Auspicious Beast Skull Bone had consumed the Evileye Tyrant’s skull bone before this. The spiritual power from consuming that skull bone was currently replenishing him slowly. Otherwise, he would have fainted, and he had no idea how long it would have taken him to wake up if that happened.</span></p>

I must! Otherwise, if the Evil Emperor dusts its hands and comes down to take a look, I’m dead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao would have trouble fighting even a single thousand-year soul beast in his current state, let alone the strongest individual among all the Evileye Tyrants!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao bit down on the tip of his tongue, and intense pain reinvigorated his spirit and pumped adrenaline into his system. He quickly checked his soul ring storage tool.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That thing was worthy of being a Class 8 soul tool, and wasn’t destroyed while under the protection of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Immunity. The hundred-thousand-year soul ring that was contained inside was also intact. At least he didn’t take that attack for nothing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao retrieved a small bracelet from his storage ring and put it on his wrist. Afterwards, he began to activate this bracelet with his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had consumed too much spiritual power, but his soul power’s situation was relatively good. The silver bracelet swiftly shone with a layer of gentle silver light as Huo Yuhao infused soul power into it, and this silver light wrapped backwards and stretched up along his wrist. The silver light quickly formed a silver bracer cocooning his left arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rows of silver light shone from his bracer, and ray after ray of silver light flickered as metal pieces covered by that silver light hovered in front of Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took a deep breath and released his soul power to produce vigorous kinetic forces, and attached those rays of silver light to his body. The silver lights rapidly covered his body, and it didn’t take long before his entire body was covered by a human-shaped soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This human-shaped soul tool was a lot prettier and more elegant than the one that he had crafted in the tournament not too long ago. This set was streamlined all over, and very simplistic and generous. A pair of wings arched behind his back, and quickly became three layers of golden wings as he infused soul power into them. Every layer of golden wings had six blasting holes, the higher wings narrower than the ones below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every other part was matched to Huo Yuhao’s frame, every component intricately and finely assembled. Huo Yuhao only looked a little bigger after donning this suit, and there were no redundancies at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the human-shaped soul tool that Xuan Ziwen had personally crafted for Huo Yuhao. Xuan Ziwen had considered that Huo Yuhao was still a Soul King back then, and so had done all he could with this soul tool to ensure that it could maintain its strength as a Class 7 soul tool, and that Huo Yuhao could still use it as a Soul King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t have time to wear this suit when he faced off against the Holy Ghost Church’s powerful individuals because everything had happened too suddenly. So this was the first time he had used it. In truth, there wasn’t any practical use to wearing this suit against those evil Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his situation was very different at the moment. With this soul tool, he could use the twelve miniature compressed Sealed Milk Bottles attached to it to sustain himself for another round of high-intensity combat. With this suit, Huo Yuhao would have no problems protecting his life even if he encountered another hundred-thousand-year soul beast. At the same time, he could use this suit to get out of the forest as quickly as possible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t fly into the sky, because he was still inside the Evildemon Forest. He activated the soul thrusters on his back and propelled himself forward at breakneck speed. His goal now was to leave the Evildemon Forest as quickly as possible, and then find somewhere safe so that he could absorb his seventh soul ring, the one from that one hundred-thousand-year Evileye Tyrant, and become a Soul Sage!</span></p>
