After a discussion, they all went to rest. After dinner and freshening himself up, Huo Yuhao went out at night again. This time, he was focused on surveying what was underground. Although he couldn’t use his Eye of Destiny, he could still detect up to fifty meters below ground. If there were problems, he would be able to discover some clues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t a brilliant method, but he had no choice. Fortunately, Sunrise City wasn’t like Radiant City. Otherwise, he needed at least half a year before he could completely survey the entire city with such a method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he walked, he tried to detect whatever there was underground. He continually used his spiritual power to carry out his detection. If it were any other soul master with a spiritual-type martial soul, his spiritual power wouldn’t be able to last long even if he had such a detection ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he walked, Huo Yuhao entered a bustling street. The two sides of the street were lined with stores, and brightly lit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He meticulously detected what was going on underground. Suddenly, he seemed to think of something, and subconsciously lifted his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far in front of him, there was a lady who was dressed to the nines blocking his way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her looks weren’t flattering – she wasn’t even at Huo Yuhao’s chest level, but her waist was three times larger than his. She was in a bright-green dress, which made her seem like a watermelon. There were even bright red flowers on her dress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her chubby face was extremely white, and she had applied even more powder on her face than normal. She had applied blood-red lipstick on her thick lips too. When she blocked Huo Yuhao, a gust of wind that carried the smell of her inferior-quality perfume greeted Huo Yuhao. The torrid smell almost caused him to bury his head in the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is this considered a biological weapon?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, do you want to come in to have fun?” She made a flirtatious gesture at Huo Yuhao and grinned at him, revealing her yellow teeth. Her voice sounded a little sharp and strained. She didn’t sound like a guy or a lady. The more frightening thing was that there was a stench that came from her mouth. When it mixed with the perfume from her body…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The originally crowded street instantly became empty within a ten meter region. At least five or six people collapsed, and Huo Yuhao also stepped back a few steps. There was an astonished look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, come in and have fun. Our ladies are delicious and cheap. No, they are high-quality and cheap.” The chubby lady pointed to a building which was shining with pink lights as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The building wasn’t very big, and seemed a little dilapidated. The pink lights made the place seem shady, while the stained walls made it seem like a cheap place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, lead the way.” Huo Yuhao covered his nose and slowly stopped looking so stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh yes, sir. You have good taste.” As the chubby lady heard that Huo Yuhao wanted to enter, she was delighted, and pulled him over. However, he dodged her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t touch me!” Huo Yuhao shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, alright. Sir, follow me.” As she spoke, she was already walking towards the building. As she walked, she even turned back to Huo Yuhao occasionally and said, “Sir, you have great taste. You can call me Lingling.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Blargh…” Huo Yuhao couldn’t stand it anymore, and retch before gesturing to the fat lady, or rather, the madam. He was asking her to turn around and not talk to him. Her ‘biological weapon’ was simply too strong for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The madam twisted her thick, red lips and turned around unhappily. After she entered the building, she shouted at the top of her voice, “Girls, come and receive our customer!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a bunch of ladies with thick makeup started to surface from different parts of the building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their dress followed Lingling’s style, which was extremely startling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stopped in front of the building and suddenly asked the madam, “You’re called Lingling, am I right? Is it the same ‘Ling’ as ‘Feng Ling’?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing his words, she started trembling. She turned around and was filled with shock as she looked at Huo Yuhao, “You, you...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll come here to have fun again.” After he finished speaking, Huo Yuhao turned around and fled. He used his Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track and quickly disappeared into the crowd without anyone noticing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The madam was shocked as she watched where Huo Yuhao had disappeared. There was an indescribably complex look in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the rest of the ladies that had appeared, they were all shouting tenderly as they chased Huo Yuhao. They were indignant, as they finally had a customer, but he ran away. However, Lingling just stood in place without moving. It was as if she had lost her soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao fled more than two streets before he slowed down. He had confirmed what he needed to confirm. Yes, he recognized that madam. Even though he wasn’t familiar with her, he was certain that she was actually a him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, it was a him, not a her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person was likely to be Feng Ling, whom he had met before. Feng Ling had left a deep impression in Huo Yuhao’s mind because of his stinky mouth and his saliva that could even cause smoke to fume when it landed on the ground. His lack of hygiene wasn’t something an ordinary person could compare to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Ling should be the young master of the Heaven’s Gate. Huo Yuhao wasn’t even sure which empire the Heaven’s Gate came from, but it shouldn’t be very strong. Furthermore, it was unlikely that the Heaven’s Gate was from the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Ling tried to take liberties of Wang Dong’er when they met the Heaven’s Gate outside Radiant City. Eventually, he was taught a lesson by Ji Juechen, and fled with his sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao also recalled that Feng Ling was the young master of the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how unhygienic he was, he possessed at least four rings, since he could compete in the tournament. However, he was now in a medium-sized city as a madam. He had even changed his gender.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was going on?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he wasn’t a member of the Sun Moon Empire, he had to be one of the hostages. However, he didn’t lose his freedom, but his gender and identity had changed. This situation had to be…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, Huo Yuhao had tried to test him when he thought of all these. He knew that he was right when he saw the expression on Lingling’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too important of a clue. If he followed the clues that came from Lingling, he might be able to find out everything he wanted to. Of course, he might have alarmed the other party with his words earlier. However, it wasn’t too much of a problem. After all, Feng Ling didn’t know who he was. It wasn’t easy to find someone like him in Sunrise City either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stopped at a remote corner, and the light around him started to distort. Very soon, he camouflaged himself with his surrounding environment and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The high-altitude surveillance soul tools in the sky could detect visual targets, but they weren’t equipped with infrared rays or soul power detectors. Current soul tool technology had yet to reach such a standard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he camouflaged himself using his Imitation, Huo Yuhao didn’t rush to leave. He quietly hid in a dark corner and waited.</span></p>

It was very difficult to imagine why the boss of this low-class brothel would let him make a fool out of himself. The only explanation was that the boss was sick in the mind.</span></p>

Very soon, he discovered that Feng Ling’s soul power undulations had yet to disappear. This meant that he was still a four-ringed Soul Ancestor. After he heard someone call his name, his expression kept on changing and he seemed a little unsettled, and even astonished.</span></p>

This is why he wasn’t anxious at all, and continued to wait silently.</span></p>

Very soon, the tempting pink lights were extinguished, and everything seemed to turn silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long afterward, a side door of the brothel opened slightly, and a stumpy figure squeezed out. Feng Ling was no longer wearing the bright-green dress from earlier. He wore a simpler gown, and observed the outside of the brothel before he snuck out. After this, he quickly walked towards a certain direction.</span></p>

He silently tailed Feng Ling, but kept a few hundred meters’ distance from him.</span></p>

The door was unlatched, and Feng Ling entered the building by pushing the door open.</span></p>

However, Huo Yuhao quickly retracted his spiritual power soon after. That was because he was shocked to find out there was a strong undulation of spiritual power coming from this building. While this undulation of spiritual power didn’t signify that the other party’s spiritual power was greater than Huo Yuhao’s, the other party might still detect Huo Yuhao’s presence.</span></p>
