 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song said, “I agree with what you described earlier, but I’ll need a more detailed plan. Devise a plan tonight, and we’ll discuss it with the Heavenly Soul Empire tomorrow, so that the mission can start quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Song, I…” Huo Yuhao still wanted to say something, but he was stopped by Elder Song.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young man, never decline to shoulder a responsibility. Don’t forget, you’re also one of the members of the Sea God’s Pavilion. Don’t throw the face of your teacher!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What else could Huo Yuhao say now that Elder Mu had been brought into the conversation? He took a deep breath and nodded seriously. “Thank you, Elder Song and Dean Yan, for your trust in me. I’ll do my best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song smiled and said, “Don’t blame us for doing this. We’re already old, and our brains aren’t working as well as they used to. You’re about the right age. Alright, discuss your plan. If you need us to do anything, you can just inform us tomorrow. We’ll go and rest first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After she finished speaking, Elder Song stood up and proceeded to her room.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was much more relaxed after pushing the responsibility away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song’s trust indeed gave Huo Yuhao great pressure. He smiled bitterly at Bei Bei, but Bei Bei turned his head away while revealing a slight grin on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xuan Ziwen didn’t want to let Huo Yuhao join this mission, Bei Bei had felt very depressed. He knew very well what Huo Yuhao could do. Elder Song’s words had resonated with him. In the entire Shrek Academy, Huo Yuhao was the one who had interacted the most with the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineer legions, and he had even attained impressive results. Without him, the Star Luo Empire couldn’t have regained control of the Ming Dou Mountain Range, and the entire situation of the war would have been very different right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t know that he was already an expert on military matters in Shrek Academy. While Elder Song appeared to be pushing the responsibility onto him, she was in fact placing her trust in him, and hoped that this would help to further train him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the future, the Academy was going to send three soul engineer legions to join the war. They would need an outstanding marshal. The soul engineer legions were formed by students and teachers, as well as externally-hired soul masters. All of them had joined willingly. All three empires of the original Douluo Continent would surely be watching them very closely. During a Conference of the Sea God’s Pavilion, it had already been decided that the three soul engineer legions could only be led by someone from Shrek, and not anyone else from the other three empires. It wasn’t that they couldn’t be trusted. It was that this project involved their interests, and there might be a conflict of interests if the soul engineer legions were led by any of the empires.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Shrek City was only a city, and Shrek Academy was a soul master and soul engineer Academy. It wasn’t a military academy. There were very few people who knew much about military matters at Shrek. In such a situation, someone like Huo Yuhao was needed to help alleviate the pressure on the Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, Elder Song intentionally wanted to build Huo Yuhao’s expertise in military matters. At the same time, it was a test for him. Earlier, the operations that Huo Yuhao were a part of didn’t involve anyone from the senior management of Shrek Academy. This time, Elder Song and Yan Shaozhe could directly observe his abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This battlefield was definitely the best place for him to demonstrate his prowess!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Huo Yuhao didn’t know the intentions behind Elder Song’s decision. He was only a little stressed out right now.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For me to command Elder Song and Dean Yan is really a little…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song left, but Yan Shaozhe didn’t. He nodded at Huo Yuhao. “Alright, let’s make a detailed plan. Everyone, contribute your thoughts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said, “Yuhao, you should be the one coming up with the plan. I only have one request: in this plan, our safety must be the first priority, especially yours. You must not expose yourself to any danger. Otherwise, I’d rather you didn’t save Xiao Ya. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed in his heart. How was it possible for them to avoid danger if they wanted to rescue Tang Ya? However, he still nodded and said, “The overall plan is in the direction that I mentioned earlier. I’ll need a few days. First, we’ll survey the Sun Moon Empire’s army from an extremely high altitude. At the same time, we need to gather some information on the Sun Moon Empire from the Heavenly Soul Empire. For example, how many soul engineer legions does the Sun Moon Empire have? How many advanced-tier soul engineers do they have? What kind of advanced-tier soul tools do they have? Of course, I’ll verify all this through my surveillance. The Sun Moon Empire is definitely prepared. They’ll use some kind of method to hide their strength and power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded and said, “It’s still the same words. Whether it’s your surveillance or our operation, safety comes first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded. “Alright, let’s discuss the plan in detail.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He lifted his gaze to look at the others, who turned their attention to him. Xu Sanshi even directly said, “Little junior, don’t look down on us. Since Elder Song has given you the reins, we’re all your soldiers now. We’ll do whatever you want.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly, “It’s not easy being the one in charge! Third senior, come up with an idea, too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi immediately shook his head and said, “I have no idea. I’m not skilled in this anymore. You can decide.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao then looked at the rest, and they also turned their heads away. When his gaze reached Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu, both of them burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed in annoyance and said, “Since this is the case, we’ll begin with the surveillance first. After that, we’ll come up with a detailed plan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without sufficient intelligence and surveillance, he couldn’t come up with a concrete plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do I need to come with you?” Yan Shaozhe asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “No, Dean Yan, you can rest. I’ll perform surveillance tonight. The Sun Moon Empire will never discover me, unless they’ve developed a new aerial surveillance soul tool.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe smiled and replied, “Alright then, you can go then. Take care of your safety. Let our contacts from the Heavenly Soul Empire escort you out of the city. You’ll only go into the sky when you leave the city, so as to prevent any misunderstandings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Spirit City was on high alert right now. Although the Heavenly Soul Empire couldn’t compare to the Sun Moon Empire in terms of aerial surveillance soul tools, there were still some aerial surveillance soul tools around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Huo Yuhao found his contact for the army, the contact immediately reported to his superiors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just a while, Princess Wei Na personally came over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment they met, she eagerly asked, “Are you going to survey the Sun Moon Empire?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and answered, “Yes! Any operation has to be built on credible intelligence from a surveillance mission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na thought for a moment before saying, “I would like to go with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao was shocked. “What kind of joke are you playing? How can someone as important as you follow me? Although it’s not that dangerous, it should never happen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na smiled and said, “Please let me go. I’ve been in the background all this while and never participated in any fighting at the frontline. I only want to do something for my empire. In fact, if not for this thought, I would have left with Aotian.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao opened his eyes wide. “Aotian? Long Aotian?” He clearly remembered that the Body Sect had appeared during the Soul Dueling Tournament. Long Aotian, who possessed a Whitesilver-level Body Soul, was very strong. No one from Shrek’s Seven Monsters could challenge him in a duel. Furthermore, Long Aotian was Princess Wei Na’s fiancé.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na sadly replied, “Yes, he’s gone. Otherwise, why would I have suggested those conditions to you? To protect me, he died from a soul ray unleashed by a Class 9 soul tool. I wanted to leave with him then, but I had no choice but to remain alive for my country. Aotian is dead and so is my heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, I don’t want to talk too much. Just let me go with you. You should know that I also have twin martial souls. Furthermore, my two martial souls are quite similar to yours. Although they are weaker, you’ll find things easier with my aid. I’m already a Soul Emperor now. I won’t burden you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Princess Wei Na was being truthful. As he saw the sad look in her eyes and thought of Wang Dong’er, Huo Yuhao couldn’t bring himself to reject her. He only nodded and said, “Alright, but you have to listen to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay. It’s a promise.” Wei Na rubbed her tears away before nodding at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
