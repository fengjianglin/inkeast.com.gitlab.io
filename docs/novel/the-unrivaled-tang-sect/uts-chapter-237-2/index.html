 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

However, they couldn’t verify this conjecture. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao had also discovered that the rest of the group hadn’t ventured deeper into the Great Star Dou Forest, but were moving up and down within the Hybrid Region. Evidently, they were looking for him and Wang Qiu’er. In addition, their anxiety was evident from the markings they left behind as they searched for them. If they slowed down a little right now, Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er would be able to catch up to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m tired!” As the sky gradually turned dark, Wang Qiu’er suddenly shouted from behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao turned to look at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After two more hours of rushing, he had finally calmed down. He walked back to Wang Qiu’er and said, “Then let’s rest. The others should be looking for us. They should be resting as night falls. We can rest for two hours before moving off again. We must find them tonight. Otherwise, it’ll be much more difficult to find them when they move off again tomorrow morning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er nodded and said, “Okay.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them sat down, and Huo Yuhao retrieved some dry rations for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er asked, “I damaged your fruits, but you’re still giving me dry rations?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stuffed the rations into her hands and replied, “We’re not kids anymore. Don’t throw a tantrum again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was stunned by his words. Even though she was older than him, she felt like she was being lectured by an elder brother at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She couldn’t help but clench her fists as she looked at Huo Yuhao’s profile. She wanted to ask him what right he had to lecture her-! However, she couldn’t spit the words out, and only heated up the dry rations quietly before giving him some.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “After you finish eating, carry on with your deep meditation. You’ve never really rested properly today. I can meditate after you recover.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he took the dry rations and walked to one side. His Spiritual Detection was still activated as he surveyed his surroundings for any potential threats.</span></p>

She regretted her impulsiveness, and could sense that her relationship with Huo Yuhao had grown more distant because of what she had done earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There hadn’t been any reason for it. She had just done what she wanted to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her eyes were filled with a proud yet stubborn look. She even had the urge to throw the baked bun in her hand away before telling Huo Yuhao that she didn’t need him to show her any mercy or lecture her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she was reminded of his teary look when she lifted her right hand. He was crying as he recounted the story of his mother and the baked bun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pride in her eyes disappeared, and she stuffed the baked bun back into her mouth again. Her proud gaze slowly faded, and she seemed slightly lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be careful.” At this point, Huo Yuhao’s voice sounded. Following this, he shared his Spiritual Detection with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s lost gaze focused once again. She lifted her Golden Dragon Spear as she jumped up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had also discovered the presence of a threat without Huo Yuhao’s verbal warning. Three pitch-black wolf-type soul beasts were coming in their direction at an alarming speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These soul beasts were all more than five meters long, and around one and a half meters at the shoulder. They were the size of huge soul beasts such as tigers and lions! It was very rare for wolf-type soul beasts to be so huge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mutants!” Huo Yuhao shouted. A white halo had already spread from his body. It was the halo of Enfeeblement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only reason why wolf-type soul beasts could be so huge was because they were mutants. They were even very strong mutants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mutant soul beasts were a very important research topic in the academy. They were like mutated martial souls. After the mutation, they could become stronger or weaker. These three wolf-type soul beasts were evidently some of the stronger ones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their cultivations couldn’t even be clearly distinguished before they arrived in front of Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Mass Enfeeblement was unleashed appropriately as it engulfed these three huge wolves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three wolves weren’t shocked by his Mass Enfeeblement. Rather, they seemed to have been provoked instead. A huge wolf at the front roared, and a layer of purple light started to rise from its burly body. It lifted its claws and stood just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was frightened. That was because the wolf looked like a human as it stood in that way. Only its head resembled that of a wolf. The protruding muscles on its body were filled with explosive strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The unknown was scary. The three wolves discovered them just as Huo Yuhao sensed their presence through his Spiritual Detection. Huo Yuhao could clearly tell that they had found them by sniffing them out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other two wolves also stood up, resembling the first wolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are mutants between wolves and apes,” Wang Qiu’er said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was enlightened –&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">no wonder their physiology is so special.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Undoubtedly, these three soul beasts must have come from the same mother. Otherwise, they wouldn’t look so similar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought of this, Huo Yuhao suddenly realized something. The two Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear cubs were still frozen. Huo Yuhao had forgotten about them after his fight Zhong Liren, and he had since been focused on rendezvousing with the rest of his teammates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it wasn’t a good time to release them now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These three wolf-apes didn’t rush to attack them. They first circled around them slowly. Not only did they possess physically strong bodies, but their intelligence was also rather high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also a very knotty situation for Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er. Such opponents were very difficult to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er stood back to back. They didn’t stretch out their hands to fuse their martial souls. Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection engulfed the entire battlefield, and a layer of golden light also covered his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These three huge wolves were at least at the ten-thousand year level. They couldn’t afford to be careless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the wolf at the front moved, his body flashing slightly. Following this, a thick aura of darkness was released from its body. Purplish-black bubbles started to spread and approach Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A darkness-type soul skill!” Wang Qiu’er shouted. Seeing that the purplish-black bubbles spreading towards her and Huo Yuhao, she stomped her right foot on the ground, and a terrifying golden wave was unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In terms of strength, Wang Qiu’er’s control was very strong. As she stomped, the immense quake avoided Huo Yuhao and didn’t impact him at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some purplish-black bubbles were destroyed by this quake, but they still continued to force their way forward.</span></p>

Her six soul rings - two yellow, two purple and two black - rose from her feet. Her first soul ring started to shine brightly, and a layer of thick golden light instantly covered every part of her body.</span></p>

She targeted the wolf-ape standing at the front. Her spear carried a piercing whizzing sound as it struck towards the wolf-apes’ eyes.</span></p>

They didn’t try to aid their partner, but leapt towards Huo Yuhao. Evidently, they wanted to kill Huo Yuhao first by outnumbering him.</span></p>

In this direction, the bubbles that had spread all over had been dissipated by Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon soul power.</span></p>

It was the Ice Empress’ Armor. His orange soul rings also rose from his feet.</span></p>

The light projection that was formed engulfed the wolf-apes that had burst over. Unparalleled Chill, Empress Sword!</span></p>

When Huo Yuhao wielded it, his wrist jerked slightly. This caused the sword to move in a beautiful arc. The chilly aura of his Ultimate Ice struck the throats of the two wolf-apes. This slowed them down.</span></p>

However, Huo Yuhao also had his own plan of attack.</span></p>

If she couldn’t take care of the wolf-ape in a duel, then they had no chance in a two versus three fight. That was why Huo Yuhao’s goal was very simple: stall these two wolf-apes in front of him and buy some time for Wang Qiu’er. While they shared a tense relationship, Huo Yuhao didn’t dare to abandon her as they faced common enemies.</span></p>

They seemed to have developed the same feeling, that if they proceeded any further, their throats would be hit by the terrifying chill. Even though they hadn’t been struck by it yet, they were already shivering.</span></p>

As his Unparalleled Chill, Empress Sword stopped the two wolf-apes, they suddenly disappeared at the same time, the instant they stopped in front of his chilly sword light.</span></p>
