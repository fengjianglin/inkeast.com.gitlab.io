The combusting Radiant Butterfly Goddess flapped her dazzling wings and hugged the Spirit Eyes’ projection. Her projection disappeared, while the bluish-purple Spirit Eyes shone ridiculously bright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dazzling, bluish-gold light flame shone brightly above the Spirit Eyes’ projection. It suddenly fell from the air and protected Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The huge Spirit Eyes appeared very deep. On a closer look, it seemed to contain a boundless world. At this moment, a beam of light that was a combination of blue, purple, and gold shot out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It shot straight, and everything that crossed its path became nothingness. That instant of brightness seemed to last an eternity. The tri-colored beam of light left a blurred trail behind as it shot forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen’s sword contained a forward-moving, indestructible sword intent. That was why his attack would never change, even if his sword left his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was too familiar with him. Along with the unparalleled detection capabilities of his Spiritual Detection, that bright light extended more than five meters in width and hundred meters in length. It extended all the way until it hit the walls of the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen’s figure was swallowed by the tri-colored light. His forward-moving momentum didn’t change, but his sword intent was destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light dispersed, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong re-appeared in Jing Ziyan’s view again. But, with Jing Ziyan flabbergasted, she forgot to unleash her next attack even though the Domain of Perpetual Ice had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She couldn’t believe what she was seeing.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What did I just see? A blue, purple and gold beam of light that was five meters wide, three meters tall and a hundred meters long? My god! What soul skill is this? Even a seven or eight-ringed soul master could only match that power after they unleashed their Martial Soul True Body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was even more shocked that the tri-colored light left a gully that was almost five meters wide, shining with a bright-golden color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A patch of gold had also formed on the wall of the academy. Furthermore, the wall, built with stainless steel, was melting at alarming speeds. A wide opening was revealed as a result of that. The golden fluid that was formed after the wall melted was also very strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen stopped less than five meters away from Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. He was still holding his sword, as if he wanted to strike. However, his sword looked a little out of shape. A strange glow was subtly revealed on its surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What soul skill is this? No, it should be a martial fusion soul skill!” Jing Ziyan exclaimed. She had completely forgotten that it was a two-on-two fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wasn’t the only one who was shocked. Ji Juechen was even more shocked than her. He felt that the streak of light was ten times the size of the Sovereign’s Descent. The terrifying spiritual shock caused his sword intent to collapse. In addition, there was even the intense aura of light from it. He felt as if his sword had gone soft, almost as if the extremely tough Extraterrestrial Meteoric Steel was cotton now. His soul power fell by almost half, and he was stuck in some kind of spiritual confusion. His thoughts were paralyzed, he couldn’t move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pulled Wang Dong’s hand, and they smiled as they looked at each other. They said simultaneously, “A Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan muttered repeatedly, “Golden Road, damned Golden Road.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being immobilized for three seconds, Ji Juechen’s body shook a little, and he finally regained his ability to move. However, there was still a layer of gold on his body. When he moved, his clothing looked like it was about to melt off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen didn’t remain behind, he shook his body and vanished. The layer of gold evaporated, and only his voice was left echoing in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huo Yuhao, I’ll never be done with you in my entire life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan’s shock slowly disappeared. She scratched her head in a very manly manner and said, “Huo Yuhao, you’re a treasure that keeps giving! I’m honored to have you as a target to chase. Juechen’s right. We’ll never be done with you in our entire lives.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao rolled his eyes and said, “This exchange will be ending a few months after the holidays are over, and I’ll return to Shrek. Follow me to Shrek if you can. There are many people over there you can pester if you want.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan’s eyes brightened, and she said, “Right, that’s a great idea. In fact, I’m getting more and more interested in Shrek Academy after knowing you. No, I must seek approval from the Hallmaster to be in the next batch of exchange students right away.” As she spoke, she turned and ran off while Huo Yuhao watched her in shock. She disappeared very quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao almost cursed, “Those rascals, surely they won’t actually follow us back to Shrek?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong glanced at Huo Yuhao and smiled. “Why? What’s going on? You didn’t seem like enemies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “They’re fanatics. They’re always pestering me to spar with them. Today’s another of my ‘lucky’ days… Second brother, you’ve given me a huge surprise!” As he spoke, Huo Yuhao suddenly turned around and hugged Wang Dong tightly once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My brother, I’m delighted to see you again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s direct and emotional words caused Wang Dong to tear up slightly. He hugged him back and muttered, “Me too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou stood there and was a little annoyed as he said, “The two of you can continue being intimate, I guess. I’ll return first. We’ll eat together later. I’ll inform Teacher Fan Yu for now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Wang Dong was barred from entering the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy when he came by this morning. He said that he was from Shrek and asked someone to help look for the exchange students. He had managed to locate He Caitou, who easily recognized him. He Caitou was surprised, and decided to give Huo Yuhao a surprise as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only now that the guards standing at the academy’s gates walked over. There were four of them. Their leader was brief as he said to Huo Yuhao, “Student Huo, you’ve breached the school rules today! Come with us to make a statement.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao relaxed his hug with Wang Dong. But, before he even said anything, he was interrupted by Wang Dong. “Why don’t you chase after the other two? Why’re you finding fault with us? Do you think we’re easy targets for bullying just because we’re from Shrek? We can make a statement if you want. However, you’ll need to fight us first!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he was very gentle when he was with Huo Yuhao, he was actually still very arrogant, just like when he had first met Huo Yuhao. He was extremely displeased, as his reunion with Huo Yuhao was being disrupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The guards were a little annoyed. “We won’t fight. We’re not sandbags. Don’t put us in a spot. Student Huo, it’s not that we’re not giving you face. However, the damages are too obvious. If the academy asks, we can’t account for them!” As he spoke, he pointed to the results of the Golden Road.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t an unreasonable person. In addition, why would he be calculative against these guards? He was apologetic as he said, “I’m sorry, I’ll pay for the repairs needed for the walls and road.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, it’s not exactly my fault. Ji Juechen and Jing Ziyan provoked us first. You have seen everything. They were the ones chasing me. Please tell the truth when you report this to the academy. I’ll record a statement to help out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The guards were relieved with Huo Yuhao’s cooperation. They got a better impression of him from that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As guards of the academy, they naturally possessed some strength of their own. They at least had the required level of cultivation. But it was their first time seeing something as dazzling as Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s martial fusion soul skill. They respected the two of them more because of that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within a few minutes, the statement was done. Huo Yuhao didn’t know that the guards made a lot of stuff up to push the problems onto Ji Juechen and Jing Ziyan. Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were completely absolved of blame. They weren’t really all that loyal to the academy. One of them was impressed by Huo Yuhao, while another approved of him because Huo Yuhao had demonstrated his respect towards them by willingly recording a statement. They even made an exception, and allowed Huo Yuhao to bring Wang Dong into the academy.</span></p>

If it were anyone else standing beside him, they would be completely overshadowed. However, Huo Yuhao wasn’t overshadowed by Wang Dong. Even though his looks were inferior to Wang Dong’s, his aura wasn’t. To the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy students, his mature and elegant aura demonstrated his strength.</span></p>

Otherwise, Wang Dong would have attracted far more attention.</span></p>

I feel so embarrassed standing beside you! Didn’t you see? There were a few female students looking this way just now. Their eyes couldn’t leave you.”</span></p>

However, I think it should be fine for you to impersonate one if you put on some makeup! Now that your hair is so long, you do seem more feminine.”</span></p>
