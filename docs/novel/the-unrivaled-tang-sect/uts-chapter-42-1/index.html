 <p><strong>Book 7: The Extreme North</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 42.1: Creating God?</strong></p>
 <p><em><strong>If you're not up-to-date on DD1, this chapter has a reference/spoiler to something that happens in it. Forewarning.</strong></em></p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm nodded forcefully. “Right, humans. Even though there are some noble soul beasts like you, who are innately born with a powerful physique, you have to admit that we’re much worse than humans in terms of talent. Although a human’s body can’t even be described as insignificant in the face of your Ice Jade Scorpion clan, they can still compete with your ten thousand year, or even hundred thousand-year-old clansmen after cultivating for several decades. Why is that? It’s because they have a different amount of potential than us. Humans have frail bodies and short lifespans. However, their potential has allowed them to obtain the blessings of the heavens; they’re incomparable. This is the advantage the humans have, and yet is also something we lack.”</p>
 <p>“Most importantly, we can’t even hope to strive for the peaks that humanity can reach. Do you still remember that incident that happened ten thousand years ago?”</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress replied, “The Heavens and the Earth changed color; a God was suddenly born.”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm said, “Right. At that time, I sensed the appearance of at least five Gods. Moreover, two of the Great Star Dou Forest’s Great Beast Kings fell. They were both powerful existences who resided within the core regions of the Great Star Dou Forest, and even though they were somewhat inferior in terms of cultivation to those sleeping fellas who absorbed my energy, the races that they belonged to were extremely domineering. One of them had the same Titan bloodline that the Titan Ice Devil King has, while the other had the bloodline of dragons. Despite this, they both still fell. However, they didn’t fall because they were killed by their enemies, but because they were used to complete the most powerful human who existed ten thousand years ago—the person who later became the most powerful God.”</p>
 <p>At that point, the Skydream Iceworm stopped for a moment. Afterwards, he continued in an even deeper voice, “Ice Empress, we both know the truth. Only Gods have an unlimited lifespan!”</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress fell silent. Striking while the iron was hot, the Skydream Iceworm continued, “Whenever we soul beasts reach a hundred thousand years of cultivation, we can choose to re-cultivate as a human. However, there are an extremely small number of us who actually dare to re-cultivate. This is because we simply have no way of guaranteeing that we can cultivate and break through to the Titled Douluo stage in a short hundred years of time. Even if we did manage to break through, it would be very hard for our lifespans to exceed five hundred years. To us, becoming a God is a mere fantasy. The Douluo continent has been around for over a hundred million years, and we soul beasts were around before humans even existed. However, how many of us were actually able to use the method of re-cultivation to achieve an unlimited lifespan as a God?”</p>
 <p>“This is also the main reason why soul beasts like you who have noble bloodlines are unwilling to re-cultivate into a human, am I right?”</p>
 <p>“I’m not willing to try that vague and unreliable method, nor am I willing to die a premature death during the process of re-cultivation. I’ve chosen another method as the next best option. That is, to create a God. By creating a deity, even though I won’t be a God, I’ll still be able to follow this God, and will possess an unlimited lifespan by becoming part of this God. As such, I’ve chosen to become a soul ring. Not just any soul ring either, but an intelligent soul ring. I want to use my power to help him become a God, step by step.”</p>
 <p>“You’re right. I’m just a piece of trash in your eyes, but I still have my million years of cultivation. Once I became an intelligent soul ring, I was able to give him a total of four soul skills, double that of you hundred thousand year soul beasts. Even though I wasn’t able to give him a soul bone, I was able to give him a martial soul, making him into a person with innate twin martial souls. This young man is only twelve, but he’s been gradually revealing his talent with my help. He has a much calmer attitude than his peers, along with the willpower to cultivate assiduously. If he has my help, why can’t he become an existence like that person ten thousand years ago. Why can’t he become a God?”</p>
 <p>At this point, the Ice Empress was finally moved. She solemnly asked, “How confident are you?”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm replied, “By myself, 30%. After all, I’m not good at attacking. As such, I can’t give him the ability to protect himself. However…”</p>
 <p>When he reached this point, he suddenly paused.</p>
 <p>“‘However’ what?” The Ice Empress asked, doubtful.</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm said, “I know what you’re thinking right now. You’re thinking of finding another human and trying to create a God like me. And you’re right to think like that. There are many areas in which you’re stronger than me. If you tried to create a God, you’d definitely be more successful than me. However, you’ve forgotten one thing: Your spiritual power isn’t anywhere near as strong as mine. More importantly, do you even have time to do the research that I’ve already done? You don’t even have a hundred years left, but I’ve already spent several tens of thousands of years thinking about this feat. Furthermore, it took me several experiments before I was finally able to succeed. You don’t have time to even do a single experiment. Even if I were to let you go, the path I’m going down isn’t suitable for you.”</p>
 <p>“Then what are you bullshitting about with me for!?” The Ice Empress immediately flew into a rage. The trace of hope that had just appeared in her heart had instantly and mercilessly been obliterated by the Skydream Iceworm. It would’ve been strange if she hadn’t been infuriated.</p>
 <p>“I’m naturally not bullshitting you. My beloved, how could I be willing to let you die? Since I’ve told you about this method, I naturally have a way to help you! It’s true that it isn’t realistic for you to create a God by yourself, as you wouldn’t be able to find a human able to withstand fusing with you, much less guarantee that you’ll be able to maintain your consciousness and your complete spiritual origin. However, I have experience in this! I’ve already done it! Moreover, your chances of success will be multiplied by ten, at the very least, with the protection of my powerful spiritual origin. Right now, if I do it by myself, I only have a 30% chance of creating a God. However, if you were to work with me, our chances would increase to 50%, minimum! Isn’t a, minimum, 50% chance to live forever worth us fighting for?”</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress was left slightly blank. She finally understood the Skydream Iceworm’s motive for explaining so much to her. A pair of crystal-yellow eyes fell upon Huo Yuhao’s body, a somewhat astonished look in them.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had silently listened to the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress’ conversation. His body felt extremely cold due to the weather, but he felt extremely passionate inwardly. He couldn’t help but admit that the Skydream Iceworm’s words were very inciting. This was especially so to the Ice Empress, who was nearing her life’s limit. The dawn of this hope was simply too attractive to her. It was no wonder that he’d brought the Ice Empress here; he knew that he’d be safe with his knowledge. He was simply poking the Ice Empress’ weak spot!</p>
 <p>Would the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion really become his second martial soul, and his second martial soul’s first soul ring? This… she was the second-ranked Empress of the Extreme North’s Three Emperors!</p>
