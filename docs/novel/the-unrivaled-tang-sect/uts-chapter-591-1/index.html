 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the four Titled Douluo were surprised to see Xu Sanshi smile at this moment when they had expected to see him panic. They all saw a smile that sent shivers down their spines.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi suddenly turned around and exposed his back to these people in front of him. He waved his Xuanwu Shield in the air as his fourth soul ring lit up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was one of Xu Sanshi's most powerful skills—Xuanwu Displacement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After releasing a flash of light, Xu Sanshi disappeared before their eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of those soul masters who were taking orders from Xue Kui and Xue Leng were stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did he disappear just like this?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though they did not know how he had escaped, they were certain that his peers from Tang Sect as well as his mother would perish under the huge wave of attacks.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did he really run away just like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they were forced to dismiss that possibility at the next instant. After Xu Sanshi had disappeared, another figure instantly appeared in his place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, this figure released an invincibly powerful light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding air suddenly became intensely cold as the temperature of the entire hall plunged instantly. Countless icicles were released at Xue Kui and Xue Leng from that person’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those icicles were at least three meters long as they penetrated and blocked every single soul skill that was coming his way. Even the four Titled Douluo had no choice but to use their soul skills to attack those icicles to prevent them from piercing their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man who was dressed in a white long robe was able to block all of their attacks with a single soul skill after appearing in Xu Sanshi’s former position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those three-meter long icicles were so strong that the Soul Sages and Soul Douluo could not hold them off. In fact, they contained so much energy that even the four Titled Douluo were thrown back by the sheer force they exerted on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Spiritual Blast.” The young man dressed in white announced with a low voice. Following which, the surrounding air suddenly became illusory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single soul master felt as though his or her head was hit by a gigantic hammer. Their bodies started to tremble vigorously as loud grunts of pain could be heard. Those soul masters who tried to release more soul skills after their previous ones were destroyed by the icicles found themselves interrupted. The Soul Sages naturally suffered the most, as they were instantly forced out of their martial soul true bodies before stumbling backward. Blood immediately gushed out from their mouths and nostrils. It was apparent that they had sustained serious injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mass Enfeeblement.” A circle of white light expanded into the surroundings before enveloping Xue Leng, Xue Kui and the rest. A powerful sense of fatigue started to plague them as the white light sapped their energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed as though the young man dressed in white wanted to inform them of his every move as he announced once again, “Spiritual Confusion.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four vortexes appeared on the four Titled Douluo’s bodies at the same time. Their sudden appearance seemed to have stunned the four of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man raised his right hand as a deep blue light appeared in his palm. The dark blue light was shining from a long blue sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, the young man slashed out with his sword as the four Titled Douluo transformed into ice sculptures. Because of how powerful the slash was, the ice sculptures flew backward after they formed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How powerful must that slash be to take down four Titled Douluo with a single blow?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that was not the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Blizzard.” Countless snowflakes started to form out of nowhere in the air. Following which, a powerful blizzard began to gush towards the group of soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the temperature in front of the young man had plummeted to below minus two hundred degrees celsius at that instant, the temperature behind him was still warm and comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being weakened by Mass Enfeeblement and Spiritual Blast, the Soul Sages and Soul Douluo who were used to winning their battles could only huddle up as they tried to warm their already frozen blood by mustering their soul power and soul skills to protect themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, all of their methods were futile. It was impossible for them to change the outcome under the wrath of the powerful blizzard. Ultimately, they would all inevitably collapse due to the insanely low temperature. The only difference was when they would collapse, because they all had different cultivations. Within ten seconds, the side of the hall that was in front of that young man had turned into a world of ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took less than a minute for that person to finish all of them off. Now, the entire hall had become silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, two familiar figures brought Xue Leng and Xue Kui into the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi was holding onto Xue Kui, while a young lady who had long violet hair grabbed Xue Leng’s armor. Both Xue Leng’s and Xue Kui’s heads were lowered. It was apparent that they had already lost all hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man dressed in white turned around and looked at the group of people from Tang Sect before smiling. “Hi, did you miss me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu rushed forward and punched his chest unapologetically. “Why did you only come now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man revealed an awkward smile. “Can’t you be a little bit gentler?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu rolled her eyes before replying, “If you want tender love, go and look for your Wutong. Wutong, I’m so glad you’re okay.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right! The young man was none other than Huo Yuhao. And the young lady who had entered the hall with Xu Sanshi was naturally Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only reason why Xu Sanshi had smiled in the face of immense danger earlier was that he had sensed Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing! Huo Yuhao had told him to switch places with him. Hence, he performed the Xuanwu Displacement to send Huo Yuhao into the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Afterward, everything became really straightforward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The powerful soul masters who had troubled the rest of them were nothing to Huo Yuhao. He could take them down extremely easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi no longer tried to meditate as she stood up and looked at Huo Yuhao in the same way as Ji Juechen. Both of them were staring at Huo Yuhao as though he was a freak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao let out an awkward laugh. “Can both of you stop looking at me like that? I’ll really start to blush.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen stomped forward towards Huo Yuhao before glaring at him with his piercing eyes. “Tell me. How did you do it? Even if you became a Transcendent Douluo, you should not have been able to pull that off. In fact, how did you take all of them down without any powerful soul skills? I can’t believe it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was probably the longest sentence the sword fanatic had constructed in a long time. In fact, he was stammering while he was speaking to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Wutong and I have regained our martial soul fusion. Now, the effects of our martial soul fusion can still last for ten seconds under our control even if we have been separated. Hence, what all of you just witnessed in the last ten seconds of the battle was pure fighting power which was unbelievably close to that of an Ultimate Douluo. That, coupled with my Ultimate martial soul, was more than enough to take all of them down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More than a month ago, before he had even become a Transcendent Douluo, he was able to force the entire Sun Moon Empire army to retreat by himself. There was no doubt that he would be able to do a lot more with his enhanced abilities. In fact, he no longer needed to wear his Icy War God’s Armor to destroy all of these Titled Douluo who were picking on Xu Sanshi and his friends. After all, the strongest Titled Douluo among them was only Rank 92.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, these people were still alive even though they had been frozen by Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice. Nonetheless, their lives were now entirely in Huo Yuhao’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi threw Xue Kui to the ground and looked away. He was so angry that he didn’t want to look him in the eye. He had long developed a murderous intent against Xue Kui and Xue Leng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, Xue Lingxun walked towards Xu Sanshi and asked, “Sanshi, who is this? Is he a senior from the Academy? Why does he look so young? Senior, do you mind sharing with me how you take care of your skin?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An awkward look immediately formed on Xu Sanshi’s face. Even though he loved his mother a lot, he could not deny that she wasn’t really sharp at times. Of course, he also knew that if his mother were a little sharper, his father would not have been able to bring her away from the palace. Hence, he was still glad that his mother was someone who was not very sharp mentally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come on, Mother. He’s not my senior. He’s a fellow disciple. To be more precise, he is actually my junior brother. His name is Huo Yuhao. Do you remember the news that came not too long ago? He is the Eyes of the Asura—the person who managed to win seven consecutive battles against Transcendent Douluo and Class 9 soul engineers by himself. He is Huo Yuhao—the Spirit Ice Douluo. This is Tang Wutong, the Dragon Butterfly Douluo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xue Lingxun’s eyes widened in disbelief as she stared at Huo Yuhao before looking back at Xu Sanshi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately moved forward with Tang Wutong to greet her. “Hello, Mrs. Xu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xue Lingxun was still trying to take in the information her son had just shared with her. Suddenly, she turned around and slapped Xu Sanshi’s arm. “You little rascal, you really are a failure! Look at him and how powerful he is. I can’t believe you’re actually older than him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Xu Sanshi was not sure whether he should laugh or cry. “Mother, how can you compare me with freaks like him!? My little junior brother is really a monster among monsters. I’m already doing quite well. I think it’s important to be satisfied with the results of one’s hard work instead of always comparing oneself with others!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan forced a cough as she spoke, “Sanshi and Mrs. Xu, don’t you think we should settle the matters at hand first?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi froze before nodding. Afterward, he turned around and looked at Huo Yuhao as though he were waiting for instructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “I am your fighter for today. Here, I will only take instructions from you. I will do whatever you want me to. But you must be the one making those decisions. Of course, I can make them die anytime. Just let me know what you need me to do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi was a little stunned by what Huo Yuhao said. Afterward, he turned around to look at his mother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xue Lingxun had become normal again. A murderous look formed on her face as she declared, “They deserve to die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi remained silent before shaking his head. He said, “I need all of you to stay here. Let me go out and get some people to come in. We need to find out what was actually going on before making decisions like these.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because the barrier outside the hall had already been removed by Huo Yuhao, news of Xue Kui’s and Xue Leng’s betrayal was spread to the rest of the city within fifteen minutes. An hour later, all of the Dou Ling Empire’s generals and ministers in the city were gathered within the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything—including Xue Kui and Xue Leng—was still as it was right after the battle. Xu Sanshi made sure that no one shifted the ice sculptures, nor did he let the father and son leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By now, both Xue Leng and Xue Kui had given up all hope of surviving. There was no chance that they could escape from this huge group of powerful soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Class 9 soul engineer who was lurking outside, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had already tried their newly enhanced martial soul fusion skills on him. They had combined their powers and given him a blow of their Heavenly Emperor’s Hammer. As many would have expected, he did not survive that blow even though he was in possession of several defensive soul tools.</span></p>
