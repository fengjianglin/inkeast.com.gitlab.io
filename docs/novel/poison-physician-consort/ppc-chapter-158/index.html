 <p>Before Bau Luochu could retort, Pei Qingfeng who was lying down was no longer able to endure it. He immediately struggled to sit up and he snapped. “I might not have expressed my attitude clearly in the past. It seems like I’ve worried young lady Qianqian in regards to my relationships. I think anyone with discerning eyes can see that I am treating Luo Chu very well.”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng made his intention very clear. He was an imperial prince. Why would someone else be allowed to criticize him? Qianqian was really a brainless fool.</p>
 <p>When Qianqian saw Pei Qingfeng getting up, she immediately greeted ‘Your Second Highness’. Her voice was soft and there was a trace of elegance. It was an entirely different tone when she was speaking with Bai Luochu. She went over and wanted to offer assistance, but before she could move, Pei Qingfeng’s words gave her a ruthless slap. “Young Lady Qianqian had better not move. I am allergic to women and it is better for Luoluo to assist me.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu was still watching from the side and she didn’t react to Pei Qingfeng’s intimate address. When she finally realized that he was speaking to her, she felt somewhat helpless in her heart. <em>He is already injured but he can still come up with all sorts of weird plans.</em> No matter what, as her patient, she had to care for him.</p>
 <p>As Bai Luochu walked towards him, she carried out her responsibilities as a physician, “Why are you awake? Do you feel any discomfort?”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng glanced at Qianqian who was standing at the side like a piece of wood. “I do not feel any discomfort, but your cousin is too noisy. I was able to hold it in when you were at the entrance but she screamed and yelled beside my bed. My eardrums nearly ruptured… Didn’t you say that I should rest well because of my injuries? Why did you let her in?!”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng had a disgusted expression on his face as he spoke to Bai Luochu.</p>
 <p>When Qianqian saw Pei Qingfeng’s expression, her heart broke. She wanted nothing more than to leave this place. Before she walked off, she didn’t forget to address Bai Luochu.</p>
 <p>“Luo Chu, you better remember this. I will take my revenge.” Qianqian young lady looked at Bai Luochu with an unyielding expression and when she turned to face Pei Qingfeng, her expression had already changed.</p>
 <p>Qianqian revealed a pitiful expression as she placed her hands in front of her chest. “Your Second Highness, you must not be mesmerized by a fickle slut like Luo Chu. If she is truly innocent, how is it possible for her to return unscathed after half a month? You might not be able to accept me now, but I am wholly devoted to you, Your Highness!”</p>
 <p>Outside, Luo Chu’s aunt heard Qianqian express herself shamelessly and she charged into the room. Pulling Qianqian behind her, she apologized with an embarrassed expression. “Your Second Highness, please don’t blame my daughter. She is a spoilt brat who doesn't know the severity of her words. I hope that Your Second Highness will not put this on your mind.” After speaking, Luo Chu’s aunt immediately dragged Qianqian outside.</p>
 <p>“Hold on. The Young Lady has yet to hear my reply. Why are you in such a hurry to leave? Are your feelings for me fake?” When Pei Qingfeng saw that Qianqian and her mother were about to leave, he stopped them.</p>
 <p>Qianqian thought that Pei Qingfeng had finally noticed that she was the better choice. She immediately swung her mother’s hand away as a brilliant smile appeared on her face. She stood in front of Pei Qingfeng and waited for his reply. She wanted to teach that slut, Luo Chu, a lesson.</p>
 <p>Qianqian’s mother had eaten more salt than Qianqian had rice. She knew that things were only going to get worse but her daughter seemed to be unwilling to leave no matter what. She had no choice but to let her daughter do as she pleased. However, she also knew that there was no chance of Qianqian mixing around the noble circle of the capital city after this incident. She was probably going to suffer a serious heartbreak this time.</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu saw how Pei Qingfeng was smiling pretentiously at a young lady, she knew that he was planning to teach her a good lesson. This was in line with her actions of allowing Qianqian to enter the room. She would also be able to strike a blow at Qianqian to relieve herself of this annoying fly. It seemed like she would be able to enjoy some peace and quiet after this.</p>
 <p>“This prince appreciates this Young Lady’s feelings. However, this prince is unable to understand something. You are a Young Lady who has yet to marry… yet, you are calling your cousin a slut every time you open your mouth. Furthermore, you are using nasty and dirty words like ‘fickle’ when describing her. Why are you insulting your relative? Is this how the general’s residence teaches their children? I once questioned Luoluo’s cold temperament. It seems like the lively side of her has been taken away by you, Qianqian. After stealing a part of someone else’s life, it is no wonder you can’t keep your filthy mouth shut.”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng didn’t hold back and Qianqian never expected him to criticize her. Her legs went soft as she kneeled on the ground. Crawling towards Pei Qingfeng, she tried to explain herself in a soft voice, “No, Your Highness, it isn’t like this. Listen to my explanation…”</p>
 <p>Who would have thought that Pei Qingfeng had an even more ruthless move? HIs smile didn’t fade as he continued, “Since your mother does not know how to teach you, why not let me do her a favor. After my injuries are healed, I will ask someone to come over to relay my order. Young Lady Qianqian is to copy the Women’s Principle several times as punishment. You should be able to learn how to conduct yourself after that. Since you wish to marry into the imperial clan, why not do a more thorough job? Treat it as an early lesson. Is aunt satisfied with my arrangements?”</p>
 <p>How could a commoner like her defy the Second Prince? Furthermore, this Second Prince was obviously sticking out for Bai Luochu. She immediately nodded and bowed, “Your Highness is wise. My daughter does need some teachings. We can’t air our dirty laundry in the open but since Your Second Highness has spoken, this commoner will not refuse your kind intentions. This commoner shall bring my daughter away in order to avoid staining Your Second Highness’ eyes.”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng nodded in response. There was a satisfied expression on his face. “It will be for the best. I am still injured and shall not send you off. Aunt may be dismissed. If Young Lady Qianqian is unable to accept reality, you can lock her up in her room for the time being.”</p>
