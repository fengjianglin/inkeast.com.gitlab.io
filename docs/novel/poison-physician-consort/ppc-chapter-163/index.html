 <p>Bai Luochu was thinking to herself. <em>Old fox! First, you interrogated me, and I was smart enough to avoid revealing my identity! You must be dreaming if you want me to praise you! Bullsh*t!</em></p>
 <p>A scheme popped up in Bai Luochu’s mind. <em>Haha, you want me to jump into the pit that you have dug. Do you think it is that easy? Today, I shall let you camp in your pit. I’ll show you what is called being too smart for your own good!</em></p>
 <p>Bai Luochu threw the old bandages away before turning back to Pei Qingfeng.</p>
 <p>“Your Second Highness has the looks of a celestial being and is an outstanding individual. You captivated the ladies in the capital and you’re a man with unmatched culture. But…”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng enjoyed listening to Bai Luochu and there was a brilliant smile on his face. When he heard Bai Luochu saying ‘but’, he didn’t hesitate and spoke to Bai Luochu, “There is no need to hesitate. You can say anything you want.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu’s eyes suddenly lit up. If one were to look closely, one could see the sinister glint in her eyes.</p>
 <p>“But my energy is limited. Back then, I was only concerned about investigating Lu Wenshu and didn’t have spare energy to understand more about Your Second Highness. Hence, my understanding of Your Second Highness is limited… your only flaw is your crippled legs. Back then, I felt a pain in my heart when I discovered such a flaw.”</p>
 <p>When the words left Bai Luochu’s mouth, a crack seemed to form on Pei Qingfeng’s face.</p>
 <p>If Pei Qingfeng’s hand could actually move, he would slap himself several times. Why did he have to ask her that question? It was fine if Bai Luochu didn’t open her mouth, once she did, her words were like a sharpened knife stabbing deep into his heart. She wasn’t going to stop until she opened a deep wound. Pei Qingfeng felt as though his wound was about to reopen.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu looked at Pei Qingfeng and noticed that his expression was like a pallet knocked over by an imperial artist. The bright colors on his face was a pleasant sight. However, Bai Luochu remembered that he was her patient and if his wound reopened because of her, she would be a sinner.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu immediately spoke up, “However, these are mere rumors. Everyone says that the Second Prince is ruined because of his legs, but I know that Your Second Highness is doing this in order to distance yourself from the imperial court. After so long, Your Second Highness never justified yourself. You can be considered a role model among the young men in Cloud Water Nation.”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng was looking better after Bai Luochu’s comments. He was able to accept anyone else calling him a cripple other than Bai Luochu. It was like getting stabbed by someone he loved. Pei Qingfeng looked at her with a burning gaze as though she was his long lost lover.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu felt Pei Qingfeng’s burning gaze and she raised her head. Their eyes met and sparks flew.</p>
 <p>The candles produced charming shadows and the duo’s shadows were pasted on the thin window panes. The first time Bai Luochu saw such eyes was when she was in love with Lu Wenshu.</p>
 <p>The temperature in the room had rapidly increased but Pei Qingfeng didn’t plan to look away. All of a sudden, knocks came from the door.</p>
 <p>“Knock knock.” The sound broke the dubious atmosphere in the room, leaving behind nothing but awkwardness.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng instantly withdrew his gaze and Bai Luochu awkwardly coughed a few times. “You may enter.”</p>
 <p>After pushing the door open, a rather attractive little face appeared in the gap of the doors. Cai Ling carefully observed for a moment and when she saw that nothing was going on between these two deities, she carried in the things Bai Luochu requested.</p>
 <p>Cai Ling brought in a mattress and a blanket. After she arranged everything, she reported to Bai Luochu, “Mistress, this servant has prepared everything. However, a man and woman cannot stay in the same room. What if you need to take a bath? It is better to return to your courtyard to do something like that. This servant shall take over your shift when you feel like taking a bath. Is that okay?”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu walked to the couch outside and realized that the mattress Cai Ling had prepared was rather soft. It was probably lying in the sun for the entire day. Bai Luochu thought that if she were to sleep on the mattress for the entire night, she wouldn’t develop backaches.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu nodded with great satisfaction and immediately praised Cai Ling, “Well done. Your suggestion is feasible. We shall act according to the situation and will go ahead with the current arrangements. When His Second Highness has recovered, we will make other plans.”</p>
 <p>When Cai Ling saw that there was nothing else she could help her mistress with, she asked to be dismissed. “It is getting late. No one stays here and if Mistress feels cold at night, please cover yourself up with the blanket. Do not catch a cold.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu nodded before she waved her hand to dismiss Cai Ling.</p>
 <p>“Are you going to stay in the same room as me?” When Cai Ling left, Pei Qingfeng’s surprised voice filled the room.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu glanced at Pei Qingfeng before explaining, “No one knows when you will recover. You can’t move right now and this is a rather remote courtyard. If I can’t rush over in time, your life will be in danger. I’m going to stay here in order to take care of you.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu finished her explanation and didn’t feel like there was anything wrong. On the contrary, she layed down and prepared to sleep.</p>
 <p>“If this news were to spread out, your reputation will suffer.” Pei Qingfeng sounded very sincere.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu’s eyes had just closed and they snapped open after hearing Pei Qingfeng’s words. She sighed, “When have I ever bothered with other people’s opinion? You can be at ease, Your Highness’ reputation will not be affected. It is late and I shall go to bed.” <span id="footnote-ref-632b"><a href="#footnote-632b">[1]</a></span></p>
