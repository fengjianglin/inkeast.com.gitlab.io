 <p>After Qianqian was dragged away by her mother, Pei Qingfeng turned to Bai Luochu and sniggered. “Divine Physician Bai is really lucky. You managed to put on such a great show for me!” Pei Qingfeng smiled. He wanted to see how this lass would defend herself after making use of him.</p>
 <p>How could Bai Luochu not understand that Pei Qingfeng had already seen through her tiny scheme? Well, no matter what, Bai Luochu wasn’t going to admit her involvement in the plan. She laughed it off, “My cousin is young, slow-witted, and rude. Your Second Highness must be really amused. I am the one at fault for disturbing your rest. I hope that you will forgive me.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng sneered and glanced at Bai Luochu. He started to tease her again. “You’re still trying to deceive me… Do you think that I can’t see through your intention?”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng wasn’t willing to expose Bai Luochu and she pretended to be innocent. “What does Your Second Highness mean? I don’t understand.”</p>
 <p>“Heh, do you think I’m blind? You obviously used me as your weapon. You find Qianqian annoying but you don’t feel like dealing with her personally. You beat her at her own game and made use of me to teach her a lesson. You even made use of her feelings towards me to get even with her. You knew that I would break her heart if I stood up for you… I never expected Divine Physician Bai to be adept at using schemes as well.”</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu saw that Pei Qingfeng was aware of her plot, she didn’t want to waste anymore time. Instead, she replied bluntly, “Since Your Second Highness already guessed it, why did you willingly act out this show? Didn’t you achieve your goal as well?”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu walked over to the table where she used to refine medicine in an unhurried manner. She carefully sorted out the medicine meant for Pei Qingfeng.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Is Divine Physician Bai a roundworm in my stomach now? How is my acting?” When Pei Qingfeng saw that Bai Luochu was still so composed, Pei Qingfeng felt rather curious. She was just a young lass. Putting aside the fact that she was able to predict his reaction, she even made him willingly act out a wonderful show for Qianqian.</p>
 <p>“Does Your Second Highness wish to know?” Bai Luochu stopped what she was doing and smiled at Pei Qingfeng.</p>
 <p>When he nodded, Bai Luochu placed down the medicine in her hand and she helped him onto a chair. “Since Your Second Highness is willing to listen, I can’t hide the truth any longer. After interacting with Your Second Highness for some time, I realized that you hate dealing with women. I also knew about Qianqian’s feelings towards you. I knew that if she were to see you, she would be deeply concerned about your well-being. Furthermore, your injuries have yet to heal and she wouldn’t be able to take advantage of you.”</p>
 <p>“Your Second Highness must be thinking of a way to reject my cousin but never got the chance. Now that I gave you a chance, how could you waste it?”</p>
 <p>“Finally… It seems like Your Second Highness is unaware. Every time you fail to take advantage of me, you will vent your frustration on someone else. Am I right?”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng broke into laughter after listening to the explanation. Due to his exaggerated motion, he pulled onto his wound and grimaced in pain. However, he didn’t forget to tease Bai Luochu, “Sss… Divine Physician Bai is such an expert in observation. You can compete against my Emperor Father’s attendant.”</p>
 <p>“In terms of physiology, we won’t lose out to those attendants.” Bai Luochu immediately retorted.</p>
 <p>When Pei Qingfeng saw that he wasn’t going to gain anything from the conversation, he stopped speaking to Bai Luochu. He was afraid she would come up with some nonsense to enrage him. Now that his injuries were still severe, it was better for him to watch his words. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be worth it if the lass made him die from excessive anger.</p>
 <p>In the end, Pei Qingfeng laid down to rest as he didn’t want to waste Bai Luochu’s efforts. However, he kept tossing around and couldn’t fall asleep. He decided to mess with Bai Luochu once again.</p>
 <p>“Nevertheless, I still helped you earlier. Don’t you have something to say to me?” Pei Qingfeng laid down on the bed and looked at Bai Luochu through the drapes.</p>
 <p>“What does Your Second Highness mean? You might be injured because of me, but my treatment isn’t free. You still need to pay me my medical fees. Furthermore, Your Second Highness addressed me as ‘Luoluo’ in front of my cousin. She probably missed it due to her crazy obsession over you. After she thinks about it, I will have to face her revenge. I blocked so many suitors for Your Second Highness and it should be enough to pay for your assistance, right?”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu took the hint but it seemed like she wasn’t interested in Pei Qingfeng.</p>
 <p>How could Pei Qingfeng not notice the meaning behind Bai Luochu’s words? She was obviously trying to draw a line between them. He instantly felt defeated. He was truly a weirdo… He gave up all the delicate, charming, and well-mannered young ladies in the prestigious clans for this vicious woman who had a heart of steel. Could it be that he was under some sort of curse?</p>
 <p>Sigh. Luo Chu’s brain was really carved out of wood. Pei Qingfeng was doubtful if she had emotions. She might be controlling herself, but he complied with her plan in order to make her happy. As for what he said to Qianqian, it was revenge for all the nasty things she said to Bai Luochu. He rejected her as he didn’t want Bai Luochu to misunderstand.</p>
 <p>Perhaps she already knew his intention and was simply acting like she didn’t know.</p>
 <p>When he thought about it, Pei Qingfeng felt sad and depressed. He wondered if he would live to see the day Bai Luochu understood his meaning.</p>
