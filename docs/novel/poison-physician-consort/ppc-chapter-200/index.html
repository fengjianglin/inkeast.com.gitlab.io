 <p>The atmosphere that the Fifth Prince had painstakingly livened fell below freezing point once again. Everyone at the table was thinking about different things and none of them could sit still. After the dishes on the table were cleared, they got ready to return to their residences.</p>
 <p>“Divine Physician Bai, why don’t I send you back?” Lu Wenshu realized that the dinner was ruined but he didn’t want to give up the great opportunity. He stood up from his seat and quickly turned his attention over to Bai Luochu.</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu saw Lu Wenshu approaching her, she silently took a step back and declined, “I appreciate Young Master Lu’s kind intentions, but the journey back to the general’s residence isn’t far. I can return by myself. There is no need for Young Master Lu to send me back.” Bai Luochu immediately turned and walked in the direction of the general residence after speaking. She didn’t give Lu Wenshu any opportunity at all.towards the general’s residence, denying Lu Wenshu his chance.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, Young Master Lu acts like a moralist when criticizing this prince earlier. Now you’re exploiting the opportunity to press your warm face against her cold bottom. Can’t you see that Luo Chu doesn’t care about you?” Pei Qingfeng’s meaning was very clear. At<em>&nbsp;least Luo Chu is willing to care for me. She doesn’t even care about you… What are you trying to do here?</em></p>
 <p>Lu Wenshu didn’t say anything but his expression became stiff. It was true that the hatred she had towards him wasn’t going to be neutralized with just a single meal. However, he had lots of time to change that. The thing he had above everyone else chasing her was his thorough understanding of her personality.</p>
 <p>When he thought about his advantage, Lu Wenshu transmitted a secret message to Pei Qingfeng. “Does Your Second Highness really understand Divine Physician Bai?” A smile hiding a profound meaning appeared on his face and he bade farewell to all the princes. “Everyone, it is getting late. Nobody Lu’s courtyard is quite a distance from here and I shall take my leave. I apologize if the dishes are not to your taste today. Farewell.” After he spoke, Lu Wenshu left without turning his head.</p>
 <p>“Second Brother, what is wrong with you today? Why are you so aggressive? Young Master Lu didn’t do anything wrong, why did you have to find trouble with him? Everyone makes mistakes… Why don’t you look the other way?” The moment Lu Wenshu left, the Fifth Prince started to blab.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng was still thinking of Lu Wenshu’s words and he automatically blocked off the surrounding noise. “What does he mean? Is Lu Wenshu related to Luo Chu?!”</p>
 <p>Before Pei Qingfeng could think it through, his carriage arrived. He boarded the carriage without another word and left the other princes behind.</p>
 <p>When the Fifth Prince saw what happened, he was shocked. He turned to ask Pei Wuchen, “Third Brother, what is wrong with Second Brother? He seems so strange… It isn’t like him at all.”</p>
 <p>Pei Wuchen was thinking about Pei Qingfeng’s actions too. Luo Chu’s ability might be more terrifying than what he and his Emperor Father knew. From the looks of it, they couldn’t ignore her existence any longer.</p>
 <p>“Don’t mess around. Your Third Brother has his concerns as well. Why don’t you return to your residence?” When Pei Rumo saw how Pei Wuchen was lost in thought, he knew that a seed was already germinating in his heart. He quickly sent the Fifth Prince away in order to get rid of the disturbance in the room.</p>
 <p>Eventually all the princes left and peace returned to the Drunk Immortal Inn.</p>
 <p>As soon as Bai Luochu stopped into her secluded courtyard, she sensed that she wasn’t alone. She carefully opened the door and saw Ying Lan’s face. A sigh of relief escaped from her lips.</p>
 <p>“Why are you here? Why didn’t you inform me in advance that you were coming?” Bai Luochu quickly poured herself a cup of tea to suppress the shock in her heart.</p>
 <p>Ying Lan acted as though his heart was in a million pieces. “Sigh, I didn’t expect that Mistress would forget my presence after my years of long service…”</p>
 <p>This was the first time Bai Luochu saw Ying Lan acting like this. She choked on her tea and most of it came out from her nose. After calming herself down, she addressed Ying Lan, “Ying Lan, why are you acting like this? You weren’t like this in the past. Furthermore, with the gap between our strengths, it is already praiseworthy for me to detect a presence in the room. How is it possible for me to detect that you are the one?” Bai Luochu wasn’t lying. Ying Lan was extremely serious in her previous life and one could never see a smile on his face. Why was he so different after her reincarnation?</p>
 <p>Ying Lan smiled and looked at Bai Luochu. <em>Mistress might not have noticed yet. After her reincarnation, she might be young and serious, but she seems more human like now compared to her old self. Whatever, it is better for me to stay silent. It will be good if she learns of it herself...&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>“Mistress, I am here to report an important matter. Sorry for frightening you.”</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu saw that Ying Lan was serious, she became aware of the situation. He had always been cautious… Now that he came without notifying her, there had to be something serious about his report.</p>
 <p>“Is there news about the Green Flame Eagle’s eggs?” Bai Luochu placed her teacup on the table and shot a question towards Ying Lan.</p>
 <p>Ying Lan smiled and praised, “Mistress knows best. Nothing can be hidden from your all-seeing mind. You are right. This subordinate did some scouting and managed to obtain some news. Mistress is the reason this subordinate was able to dig out the location of the egg.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu felt confused. “Because of me? I didn’t do anything…”</p>
 <p>“Firstly, Mistress unveiled the Feng Wan’er’s true colors in front of everyone’ Secondly, Mistress spoke to the Emperor and he became apprehensive about the Third Prince’s marriage. After his rejection of the alliance marriage, the relationship between the Phoenix King Valley and the imperial clan turned sour. The Phoenix King Valley left the relay station and moved into a courtyard in the outskirts. Without guards from the imperial clan, this subordinate was able to move around freely.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu didn’t think so far when she exposed Feng Wan’er. She only wanted to embarrass the Phoenix King Valley and everything else was collateral damage.</p>
