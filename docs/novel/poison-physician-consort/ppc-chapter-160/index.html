 <p>Pei Qingfeng was suffering from his excessive loss of blood and after scolding Qianqian, he could no longer hold off the sleep monster.</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu noticed that Pei Qingfeng had fallen asleep, she became more careful and made sure she didn’t disturb his rest.</p>
 <p>As soon as Bai Luochu finished prescribing the medicine, she walked quietly towards the courtyard. It seemed like she was afraid of waking him up. No matter how careful she was, things weren’t destined to go her way. She ended up knocking into a screen.</p>
 <p>“Bang.” The screen nearly fell over and it was fortunate Bai Luochu had quick reactions. She caught the screen before it landed on the ground.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu cautiously turned around and looked at Pei Qingfeng. She let out a sigh of relief when she saw that Pei Qingfeng merely frowned. She placed the screen upright before leaving the room.</p>
 <p>Lying on a couch in the courtyard, Cai Ling barged through the doors before her seat was even warm.</p>
 <p>“Mistress! Are you alright?!” Due to her worry, Cai Ling yelled out when she saw Bai Luochu’s figure. She didn’t know that there was someone resting in the room.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu was shocked and her mind was a little hazy. She didn’t know who had entered the courtyard but she placed her index finger on her lips and made a shushing motion. She slowly sobered up and shook her head to get rid of the last trance of drowsiness. She finally saw the person who entered the courtyard and she said, “Let’s talk outside.”</p>
 <p>Cai Ling didn’t say anything. Bai Luochu was her mistress and if her mistress asked her to do something, she should carry out her orders. Cai Ling simply turned her body and left the courtyard.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu stared blankly for a moment before climbing out of her couch. She wanted to straighten out her clothes but she realized that it was stained with dry blood. It was no wonder Cai Ling was so surprised.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu hated being dirty. She didn’t bother changing out as she was afraid she would delay Pei Qingfeng’s treatment. Right now, she started to feel a little uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>Looking at her bloodied clothes, Bai Luochu didn’t wish to tidy up anymore. Without any hesitation, she walked outside. After exiting, she didn’t forget to close the doors tightly. She didn’t want to disturb Pei Qingfeng’s rest and neither did she want to let him eavesdrop on their conversation.</p>
 <p>“Mistress, what happened to your clothes…” Cai Ling was rather alarmed when she saw Bai Luochu’s bloodied clothes. Furthermore, she knew that her mistress was someone who liked to be clean. No matter how busy she was during her daily cultivation, she would still take a bath. This was truly an anomaly.</p>
 <p>“This isn’t my blood. The Second Prince rescued me and suffered a severe injury. He is resting inside right now after receiving treatment from me. After wrapping up his wounds, Qianqian came to look for trouble. I am too tired and wasn’t able to change out of my travel-worn clothes.” Bai Luochu was obviously exhausted. Even the way she spoke sounded different.</p>
 <p>“Where is Commander Ying? Didn’t he return with you?” Bai Luochu felt suspicious when she didn’t see Ying Lan. After all, Ying Lan was a responsible person. Now that he wasn’t here, Bai Luochu started to worry. She thought that something had happened to him at the Falling Cloud Mountain Range.</p>
 <p>Cai Ling stammered and it seemed like she didn’t wish to reply. Bai Luochu became even more anxious and ordered Cai Ling to speak. “Just say it. You don’t need to hide anything from me.”</p>
 <p>“It is just… Commander Ying is fine, but he was unable to snatch the eggs of the Green Flame Eagle. He felt that he let you down...” Cai Ling spoke apprehensively and was afraid that Bai Luochu might blame her.</p>
 <p>“Pfff, just this?” Bai Luochu’s energy returned and she broke out into a smile. After so long, Bai Luochu was finally able to laugh without restraint.</p>
 <p>Since Cai Ling followed Bai Luochu into the general’s residence, she realized that Bai Luochu would either be coming up with some plans, or messing about with Qianqian. Cai Ling never saw her laughing out loud before. Now that she saw it, she was stunned.</p>
 <p>“If that’s all, all of you can rest assured. I subdued the Green Flame Eagle and I will bring it back soon. As for its eggs, I made a promise to the Green Flame Eagle to retrieve them.” Bai Luochu reassured Cai Ling.</p>
 <p>Cai Ling suddenly let out a breath of relief. In the end, she didn’t succeed in her task and wasn’t able to protect her mistress. Furthermore, she allowed an innocent person to be implicated and felt rather guilty. She immediately asked Bai Luochu, “Mistress, is there something I can help with? It is my fault for not protecting you properly. Now that the Second Prince is injured, I should do something. Can Mistress please advise me?”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu originally wanted to say that it wasn’t Cai Ling’s fault. However, when she saw Cai Ling’s face, Bai Luochu felt that she had to ask Cai Ling to do something. With Cai Ling’s resolute attitude, if Bai Luochu were to brush it off, it would gnaw at Cai Ling’s mind. It would be detrimental for her future development.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu immediately made a decision and instructed Cai Ling, “Since that is the case, you should do something for me right now.” Cai Ling swiftly nodded her head. Bai Luochu started to bark out her orders. “You will boil some water for me to take a bath. You will then prepare a set of clean clothes for me to change into after my bath. After that, you will go and take care of the Second Prince while I rest. When he wakes up, you will notify me, do you understand?”</p>
 <p>How could Cai Ling not understand Bai Luochu’s intention? She immediately acknowledged her tasks and went on to carry them out.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu returned to her room and started to write out Pei Qingfeng’s next prescription. She prepared all the ingredients before going outside to wait for Cai Ling.</p>
 <p>Cai Ling was afraid that Bai Luochu might wait for too long and just as Bai Luochu exited the inner room, Cai Ling had completed all her tasks.</p>
