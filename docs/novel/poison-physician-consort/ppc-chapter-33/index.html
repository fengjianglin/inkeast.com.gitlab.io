<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After bidding farewell to the Second Prince, Bai Luochu wandered around in the streets of the imperial capital aimlessly. She was watching the distant lights as she listened to the faint music coming from the palace. All while there was a war going on in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Should she return or simply slip away? Be it in her previous life or current life, she wasn’t willing to be tied down. If she really returned to the First Prince's residence, there was no doubt she would be confined there for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">She was having second thoughts as her life was great in the First Prince’s residence. With her current strength, if she were to explore the world, it would be difficult for her to survive. But inside the First Prince's residence, she was able to obtain spirit medicine that could aid her in her cultivation. She didn’t even have to worry about food and clothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After considering this point, Bai Luochu still hesitated. However, a thought flashed in her mind which caused her to make up her mind about returning to the First Prince's residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">That’s right. It was Zi Su, that servant girl who had unconditionally trusted her. She was still waiting for Bai Luochu to return. If Bai Luochu didn’t return, Zi Su would probably be in for a bad time. As she thought about the aftermath of her decision, Bai Luochu made a turn and headed back to the First Prince's residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Furthermore, such a carefree and unfettered life was something which Bai Luochu never had in her previous life. Why not return and stay for a few more days?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Speaking of the most important reason, Bai Luochu wanted to know why the First Prince had bought her as a personal servant. He even treated her like a distinguished guest. What was he planning...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Bai Luochu was utilizing her strange movement skill and she wanted to hide her tracks by going through the bazaar before heading back. When she suddenly recalled that she had garnered so much attention during the birthday banquet tonight, it was highly possible that the First Prince had already seen her. There was no longer any need for her to be careful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When she thought about it, Bai Luochu realized that she didn’t have to waste her time and energy. She simply headed back to the First Prince's residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After slipping back in through the back gates, she headed towards her courtyard. Just as Bai Luochu entered the room, she noticed someone standing inside. She only relaxed when she realized that Zi Su was the one standing in the inner room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This little servant girl was dozing off which made Bai Luochu want to laugh out loud. Bai Luochu decided not to only when she felt guilty for all her actions today. She called out softly, “Zi Su, Zi Su. Wake up, I am back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Zi Su was shocked. When she saw that the person in front of her was Bai Luochu, she started to complain. “Young Lady, why are you back so late? What if you got captured by some evildoer? If Young Lady continues behaving like this, I will have to follow you closely! I won’t leave your side by more than an inch!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After hearing Zi Su nagging at her without end, Bai Luochu who didn’t have any intention to sleep almost dozed off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When Zi Su saw Bai Luochu dozing off, she stopped talking as though she was afraid she might wake Bai Luochu up. Zi Su then moved efficiently and swiftly to help Bai Luochu take off her clothes before helping her clean up. After Zi Su had done everything, she bowed to Bai Luochu before leaving the room silently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Just as Zi Su stepped out of the door, she yawned as she was urgently in need of rest. She quickly jogged back to her room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As for Bai Luochu, her lethargy vanished the moment Zi Su stopped talking. The moment Zi Su left, she felt extremely energetic. She started to quietly recall the expressions from the members of Phoenix King Valley and the information they brought. Perhaps, it was due to the frightening moment in front of the palace gates which exhausted her, or because she didn’t make any progress after analyzing the information she obtained today. Bai Luochu felt overwhelmed with sleepiness as she fell into a deep slumber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Just as Bai Luochu had fallen asleep, the First Prince, Pei Rumo, returned to the residence. Before he entered the study, someone knelt down in front of him to ask for forgiveness. “It is this subordinate’s failure for not being able to watch that slave properly. Your Highness, please punish this servant.” As that person spoke, he kowtowed and knocked his head on the ground towards Pei Rumo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">There was a moment of silence in the study room. Pei Ruo didn’t say anything about punishing this guard and neither did he pardon the guard. The current state that the First Prince was in made the guard even more apprehensive as he didn’t know what kind of punishment he was going to face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Pei Rumo was currently pondering about Bai Luochu’s true identity. She was obviously sold to the Bestial Battle Arena and was toeing the line of life and death. Right now, she was able to stand beside Pei Qingfeng who never allowed any woman to approach him. Was this really the Luo Chu he saved? Something was really wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“What has Luo Chu been doing in the residence lately?” Pei Rumo suddenly spoke to the guard who was kneeling in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When the guard saw that the First Prince was only asking about the servant girl that he bought, the guard was stunned. After bracing himself, he reported.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“There isn’t anything special about her. Other than cultivating, eating, and sleeping, she does nothing. She spends most of her day cultivating, regardless of day or night. Her most recent trip out of her room was to view the scenery at the garden and she even encountered His Highness, the Ninth Prince. When this subordinate saw that the two of them were having a rather pleasant conversation on topics which were of no great importance, I didn’t separate the both of them. I never expected that she would be able to enter the Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet. Let alone enter as the Second Prince’s personal servant girl.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The guard stammered when he got to the end of his report. After all, his lord was the one who bought Bai Luochu as a personal servant. Due to his negligence, she turned into the Second Prince’s personal servant and publically appeared in front of all the nobles in the capital. This was truly embarrassing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Pei Rumo suddenly recalled that Bai Luochu seemed to still have an innately crippled meridian back at the Bestial Battle Arena. How was she able to cultivate? It seemed like this woman had plenty of mysteries that had to be uncovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Why not let this subordinate bring this person here for my lord to personally interrogate?” When the guard saw how Pei Rumo was staying silent again, he probed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“She has already been bought by me. There is no need to hurry. First thing in the morning tomorrow, bring her to see me in the main hall. I am really tired today... You may be dismissed.” After giving out his instruction, he waved his hand to signal for the guard to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When the guard saw that he was pardoned of all punishment, he immediately bade the First Prince farewell. He slipped away so quickly people who saw him might think that there was oil under his feet. He was afraid Pei Rumo might change his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Early the next day, just as Bai Luochu finished her breakfast, a guard knocked on her door. He summoned Bai Luochu to the main hall for the meeting with Pei Rumo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Bai Luochu understood that the First Prince must have recognized her in the palace banquet the day before. She had long expected for Pei Rumo to summon her for a discussion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Bai Luochu wasn’t afraid at all. Instead, she even felt curious about the First Prince. If he was really getting suspicious about her, she planned to push all the blame to the Second Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Thinking up to this point, Bai Luochu tidied up her appearance and walked in the direction of the main hall.</span></p>
