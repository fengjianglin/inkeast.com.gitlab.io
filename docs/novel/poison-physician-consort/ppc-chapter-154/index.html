 <p>From the Falling Cloud Mountain to the Cloud Water Nation’s general's residence, Bai Luochu enjoyed a rather eventful few days. However, this wasn’t the only place bustling with excitement. The Palace of Brilliance Resurgence overseen by Guan Yue was also rather lively.</p>
 <p>“How many has it been?” Guan Yue was rubbing his temple as if he was having a headache. He placed his elbows on the table and used his hand to support his chin as he questioned the other members of the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence.</p>
 <p>The rest of the members looked at each other with dismay and after a long moment, one of them stammered, “Young… Young Master Guan. Many people visited and we didn’t keep track of the numbers… We only know that there is one bottle of antidote left.” The person lowered his head with embarrassment as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue understood the reason behind Divine Physician Bai’s insistence for him to oversee the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence. Most of the major and minor factions in the Cloud Water Nation were drawn to the Falling Cloud Mountain Range, but these factions left people behind to guard their bases. Most of them were small fries who were not qualified to take part in the battle at the Falling Cloud Mountain Range.</p>
 <p>The Palace of Brilliance Resurgence had suddenly emerged within a short span of two weeks, just like spring onion in a drought. No one would believe if the other factions would allow them to do as they wished.</p>
 <p>As a result, Guan Yue had been extremely busy. It felt as though the surrounding small factions were lining up to test the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence. There were some who were competent enough to withstand the poison array, but when they reached the main entrance of the Palace of Resurgence, they passed out. There was a weakling who even fainted in the middle of the poison array. Guan Yue even had to send out men to feed that person the antidote before escorting him back to his faction.</p>
 <p>When the person woke up and realized that he was back at his base, he was shocked. He asked the other disciples and when he learned about how he was politely dropped off by the members of the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence, he felt humiliated. He wanted to go to the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence to regain his honor but he recalled that he wasn’t even able to reach their gates. He stood at the foot of the mountain and yelled at the palace as he requested for them to send someone to fight him.</p>
 <p>The Palace of Brilliance Resurgence thought that this person would give up after a few days. No one expected him to set up a shed at the bottom of the mountain. When he became tired from shouting, he retreated to his shed and took a rest. There were times when this person came during the night and yelled the moment the day started. Everyone felt uncomfortable because of him and someone finally sent him a message.</p>
 <p>A slip of paper arrived at his shed which read, “Sire must be exhausted after the past few days. It’s a blessing for someone like you to take note of our Palace. However, we want to exist in harmony with everyone and will not want to fight with sire. We think that sire is frustrated because of the poison array at the bottom of the mountain. We apologise for our negligence. The poison array is something a random physician set up and we do not intend to hurt anyone. If we can’t satisfy you with our explanation, the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence will await your grand arrival.”</p>
 <p>Rumor had it that the person fainted the moment he read the message. Guan Yue eventually explained the reason behind it.</p>
 <p>“If this person is willing to waste so much time because he fainted in the poison array, he is definitely a prideful being. We simply need to tell him that the poison array is merely something at the elementary level and a random physician was the one who set it up. When he learns that he isn’t competent enough to deal with a physician, he will definitely break down.”</p>
 <p>Guan Yue might be noble and virtuous, but he still grew up in an aristocratic clan. He studied stratagems and the art of war. He knew that he had to target the heart when dealing with such people.</p>
 <p>When Guan Yue heard that the person had vomited blood, he simply passed down the order, “We are the ones at fault here. Get someone to buy some superior medicine from the Hundred Herbs Hall and deliver it to that person. Let him know that it was prepared by our physician after learning that his poison array caused so much trouble. It’s a sign of our apology.”</p>
 <p>The rest of the members from the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence couldn’t understand Guan Yue’s method of doing things and asked, “Young Master Guan, I don’t think the person will consume the medicine. Why are we wasting our time?”</p>
 <p>“It is his decision to consume the medicine. Delivering the medicine will show our etiquette. Just carry out my order. Nothing will go wrong. When you deliver the medicine, you will understand the reason.” After Guan Yue spoke, he rubbed the joint of his left index finger and revealed a profound smile.</p>
 <p>One of the members of the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence acted according to Guan Yue’s instruction. He immediately headed to the capital city to get some medicine before rushing over to that person’s sect. When the disciples guarding the mountain gate heard that he was here to offer their apology, they allowed the member of the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence to enter.</p>
 <p>After he arrived, he placed the medicine down and repeated everything Guan Yue had mentioned. In response, the person fainted on the spot.</p>
 <p>It was said that when that person finally woke up, he wasn’t able to stand up. His cultivation was wasted and he was no longer able to move. He might still be alive, but he was a living vegetable.</p>
 <p>Everyone immediately understood that Guan Yue was making an example out of this person. He was killing a chicken to warn the monkey. Those small factions didn’t dare to send anyone else and Guan Yue managed to achieve his goal.</p>
 <p>The reputation of the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence started to spread from the surrounding factions. At the start, everyone said that they shouldn’t be provoked. However, as the rumors started to spread, the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence became unfathomable and their poison array was praised to be able to whittle a person’s willpower away.</p>
 <p>Most of the factions behaved themselves, but there were still a few that didn’t believe the rumors. They sent over several individuals in order to test the waters.</p>
 <p>“Young Master Guan, what do you think about these two individuals?” It had been quite a long time since someone came looking for trouble, therefore, the members of the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence were at a loss of what to do.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue glanced at them indifferently and said, “What else can we do? Follow the normal practice. If they are some demonic moths here with weird ideas, just deal with them as per usual.”</p>
