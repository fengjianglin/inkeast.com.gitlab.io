 <p>Bai Luochu steered the carriage with extreme speed. The general's residence wasn’t like those aristocratic clans that were still in power. It was situated at the outskirts of the capital city. However, they were able to arrive within a short period of time.</p>
 <p>As soon as Bai Luochu stopped the carriage, she quickly and carefully pulled Pei Qingfeng out . She carried him over her shoulder and walked into the general's residence. When she reached the entrance, she was obstructed by the guard servants.</p>
 <p>Looking at the two of them right now, it would be strange if they weren’t stopped.One of them had disheveled hair and had a mask on his face. The other had a horrific wound on his chest and it looked like someone dragged him out from a pool of blood.</p>
 <p>“If the two of you are here to visit my Master, please hand over the invitation card. If you are here to seek refuge, please go to other residences. Our general's residence isn’t some wealthy clan big enough to accommodate two buddhas like you.”</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu heard what the servants said, she was enraged. She spoke to Pei Qingfeng, “Help me take off my mask.”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng’s brain was already muddled and when he heard Bai Luochu’s voice, he simply peeled off the mask on her face.</p>
 <p>When the guard servants saw the face behind the mask, they were shocked. Wasn’t she the young lady?</p>
 <p>“What are you standing around for?! Open your eyes wide and look carefully! I am the official owner of this residence. No matter how small the general's residence is, you still have to accommodate this buddha. As for the person I am carrying, he is the Second Prince. Right now, he is suffering from severe injuries and I am trying to save his life! If something were to happen, even if you had tens of heads, it won’t be enough when His Majesty starts to investigate the matter. The entire general’s residence will be buried along with the prince! Hurry up and help me carry the Second Prince inside!” When Bai Luochu saw how clumsy these servants were, she flew into a rage. Was her uncle’s family crazy? Why did they hire these fools?</p>
 <p>Those guard servants were like wooden blocks as they stood at the entrance. They only started to move when they heard Bai Luochu scream about how everyone was going to die. They quickly helped Bai Luochu to bring Pei Qingfeng into the secluded courtyard. They didn’t even complain when they realized their hands were covered with blood.</p>
 <p>These guard servants might be fools, but they weren’t actually retarded. After calming down, they realized that there was something wrong.</p>
 <p>Firstly, Young Lady Luo Chu never left the general's residence. How did she come back if she didn’t leave? Furthermore, she was dressed in a crude man’s robes and had a mysterious mask on her face. Secondly, wasn’t the person she was carrying the Second Prince? How could he suffer such horrific injuries?</p>
 <p>“Hey, do you guys feel that our Young Lady’s outfit earlier has some resemblance to that renowned Divine Physician Bai in the capital city?” One of the guard servants contemplated for a long time before prompting a question.</p>
 <p>“What a joke. With the likes of the general's residence? A declined noble clan? Young Lady Luo Chu is an orphan daughter and it is already a blessing for her to still be alive. Where did she get the money to study medicine? How is it possible for them to allow her to learn medical skills? If they could, shouldn’t the young lady be the one to obtain the benefits?” The other guard servant spoke with extreme disdain.</p>
 <p>As the guard servants quarrelled with each other, Bai Luochu had already disinfected Pei Qingfeng’s wound.</p>
 <p>The blood on Pei Qingfeng’s body had already dried up and if she were to rip his clothes off, a layer of his skin would be peeled off as well. In the end, Bai Luochu decided to use a pair of scissors to cut away the cloth stuck to his body.</p>
 <p>The scissors was made of metal and to prevent rust on the scissors from infecting the wound, Bai Luochu soaked the scissors in white wine before cleaning it with a clean cloth. She sterilized it over the flame of a candle to ensure that the scissors could cut open the clothes easily. It would also prevent the wound from being infected.</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu started cutting, Pei Qingfeng didn’t forget to make fun of her. “Men and women should not touch each other. Now that I am going to let you see my naked body, is Divine Physician Bai going to take responsibility? If you are unwilling to marry me to compensate me, I am willing to marry you.” Pei Qingfeng naturally wanted to send his message across.</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu looked at Pei Qingfeng, she had an expression of extreme dislike on her face. She sneered, “Your Highness must be joking. In front of a physician, gender is non-existent. Even if Your Highness were to take off your pants, you will look the same as a piglet bred by the village girl. However, the piglet is easier to treat than you. Your body is very frail right now and you should keep your mouth shut. Save some energy now so that you will have the strength to scream later.”</p>
 <p>Was this still the Second Prince? How could he behave so shamelessly? Bai Luochu couldn’t help but childe him in her heart.</p>
 <p>After Bai Luochu replied, she sliced open the clothes on his body.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng’s upper body was revealed and Bai Luochu fished up the cloth that had been boiling in the pot. She wrung it before she wiped the blood stains off Pei Qingfeng’s body.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng was currently observing Bai Luochu’s expression as he wanted to see the bashful face that belonged to a young lady. After waiting for a long time, he noticed that her expression was one of seriousness. Let alone being shy, it would be easy to convince someone a wall had more expression than her.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng suddenly felt that he was inferior to that piglet raised by the village girl. In any case, Bai Luochu might feel that the piglet was cute. It was either that or the piglet could be turned into something delicious. As for Pei Qingfeng, he was only able to cause her more worry. It was good enough she wasn’t angry with him.</p>
 <p>After Bai Luochu cleaned up the blood, she searched through her box for an elixir. She took out a pill and stuffed it into Pei Qingfeng’s mouth.</p>
 <p>“This is a medicine I refined recently and it’s suitable for people who are seriously injured. I made it using all sorts of valuable medicine ingredients. I even improved the formula after referencing it with some ancient text. Be at ease and consume it. You will be fine.” Bai Luochu explained and started to look for something else.</p>
 <p>When Pei Qingfeng saw how busy Bai Luochu was because of him, he suddenly felt the sword to his chest was worth it.</p>
