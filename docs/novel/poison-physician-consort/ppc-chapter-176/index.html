 <p>“My injury is almost fully recovered. Ask the men from my residence to deliver something to relieve my boredom. There’s nothing to do when you’re not here...” Pei Qingfeng had an innocent expression as he relayed his message to Bai Luochu..</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu heard what he said, she frowned. “Since you are almost fully recovered, why don’t you get someone to bring you back? All your medicine is ready and you can leave right now. You can enjoy yourself back at your residence and I can have my peace and quiet.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu’s simple-minded expression enraged Pei Qingfeng to the point where his heart started to throb with pain. <em>Why should I return to my own residence? So that you can enjoy your time with that slimy Lu Wenshu?</em></p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng felt sour in his heart and he started to criticize Bai Luochu. “Sigh... you’re really heartless. Just a few days ago, you said something about being a compassionate physician. Right now, you’re trying to get rid of a patient who hasn’t fully recovered. Tsk tsk tsk, my pitiful self risked my life to save you, only to be abandoned. What a miserable life. People who hear my story will feel heartbroken and those who witness this scene will bawl like a baby.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu was an evil dao witch in her previous life and everyone knew that she had a cold and indifferent personality. No one dared to act so unbridledly in front of her. Pei Qingfeng was different. Luo Chu was the daughter of the former military general and he was the Second Prince. If a prince was able to put down his pride and speak to someone in this manner, the individual should feel honored. If one didn’t respond respectfully and tactfully, they would be labeled as ignorant fools.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu was someone who wouldn’t back down when facing a stubborn mule. However, when she interacted with people weaker than herself, she would behave more politely. No matter how many martial art manuals she read and how much she trained in the temple, Bai Luochu never learned how to deal with shameless people. Moreover, this shameless person in front of her was a prince. He was also someone who saved her life.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu was helpless and in order to stop Pei Qingfeng who looked like he was about to burst into tears, she had no choice but to pacify him. “Alright, alright, alright, stay! As long as Your Second Highness doesn't feel that this secluded courtyard will lower your status, you can stay as long as you like. I will ask someone to head over to the Second Prince’s residence to deliver your message. Is that okay?”</p>
 <p>Seeing that his schemes had succeeded, Pei Qingfeng immediately withdrew his act. His elegant and refined manners surfaced once again as he thanked Bai Luochu, “I shall thank Divine Physician Bai in advance. I seek Divine Physician Bai’s forgiveness for the intrusion.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu turned around and continued preparing the medicine. She stood at an angle where Pei Qingfeng couldn’t see her face as she rolled her eyes up all the way to the sky. He was the one who was complaining about staying here in the first place. All of a sudden, he made it seem as though she was the one chasing him away… Bai Luochu lamented in her heart. She had seen many shameless people throughout both her lives, but she had never seen anyone as shameless as Pei Qingfeng. Was he an actor who learned how to act in the Pear Garden?</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu might be complaining about Pei Qingfeng, but she already agreed to help him deliver a message to the Second Prince’s residence. She wasn’t going to go back on her words and she immediately got someone to deliver his message.</p>
 <p>When Pei Qingfeng’s message arrived at the Second Prince’s residence, his personal guard was extremely confused. What else did his master like to do apart from cultivating and pestering Divine Physician Bai? Could it be that he wanted to study ancient text while lying in bed in the general’s residence?</p>
 <p>If that was what the Second Prince wanted, he would simply shift a little of the residence’s library collection. Just as the secret guard was preparing to transport the ancient texts, he suddenly recalled that His Second Highness finally found a chance to get close to Divine Physician Bai. <em>Master shouldn’t waste this chance.</em> Since his master was going to stay at the general’s residence for a long period of time, shouldn’t he bring more ancient texts over?</p>
 <p><em>That’s right, Master also liked to do some inscription on folding fans during his free time. I will bring over some empty folding fans and some ink.</em></p>
 <p>As soon as he thought of it, the guard filled an entire carriage with items and delivered them to the general’s residence.</p>
 <p>By the time Pei Qingfeng could react to his guard’s antics, everything was piled up in front of him. If they were all stacked up, they could form a new table in the room.</p>
 <p>“You... why did you bring all these things here?” When Pei Qingfeng saw everything in front of him, he felt his scalp going numb. Even his head started to ache.</p>
 <p>That guard looked at the pile of things and replied confidently, “Master, didn’t you say to bring some stuff over? I knew that you had a habit of studying ancient texts and writing calligraphy on folding fans. When I thought that you had finally found an opportunity to stay beside Divine Physician Bai, I brought more of them along with me. After all, weren’t you planning on staying for a long period of time?” When the guard spoke to Pei Qingfeng, Bai Luochu was somewhere else. As such, the guard didn’t hold himself back.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng felt helpless when he looked at his silly guard who had expectant expression plastered onto his face. He had no choice but to bite down hard as he replied, “I really don’t know if I should be praising you or criticizing you.”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng wanted to praise the guard, but decided against it. He was also unable to scold the guard as the guard managed to consider the fact that he was planning to spend a long time at the general’s residence.</p>
 <p>The guard didn’t understand a word that was coming out of Pei Qingfeng’s mouth and he stood at the side patiently, waiting for his master to speak up.</p>
 <p>“I called you here because I need you to spy on someone for me. He is extremely powerful and you cannot get too close to him. Report his actions to me. As for his name, he is rather famous… Your target this time is Lu Wenshu.”</p>
 <p>“Lu Wenshu? Master, you are making things difficult for me! Who can spy on him without him noticing? If he notices me, won’t I be dead?”</p>
 <p>“Just do it. Even if you don’t want to, you still have to do it! Stop messing around.” When he did things for Bai Luochu, Pei Qingfeng disregarded everyone else around him.</p>
 <p>When the guard heard Pei Qingfeng’s adamant order, he complained. “Master, can you at least tell me the reason?”</p>
 <p>“Cough cough. Firstly, he injured me, I need to know my enemy well if I want to take revenge in the future. Secondly, he has been pestering Luo Chu recently... I am afraid he has ulterior motives.”</p>
 <p>The guard thought that the second reason was the true reason he was assigned to such a dangerous job. <em>Sigh, since Master started mixing around with the orphan daughter from the general’s residence, his mind is filled with nothing but her. If this incident was recorded in the history books, Master would probably be portrayed as an incapable ruler who neglected important affairs in pursuit of a beauty, right? Luo Chu would be made out to be the seductress who brought calamity and destruction to the nation.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng immediately sneezed a few times and he suddenly raised his head. “Are you cursing at me secretly?”</p>
