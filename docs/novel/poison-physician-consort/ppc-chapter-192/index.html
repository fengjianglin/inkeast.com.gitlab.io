 <p>That young man was extremely infuriated by Guan Yue’s words. As soon as he got up, he launched another attack. Even though his killing move was in front of Guan Yue’s face, Guan Yue didn’t move. He simply looked at the sword qi filled with murderous intent without batting an eyelid.</p>
 <p>Cold sweat filled everyone’s forehead but they realized that the once stationary Guan Yue had disappeared. In the next moment, he appeared in mid air and kicked the young man ruthlessly in the back.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t surprising when the young man fell to the ground again.</p>
 <p>“This shall be considered my first move. In ten moves, I will make you admit defeat.” Guan Yue didn’t return the insults. Instead, he stated his decision calmly. It was as though defeating the young man was as easy as drinking a cup of tea.</p>
 <p>When he heard how Guan Yue was looking down on him, the young man attacked again. Guan Yue used the same move nine more times in succession. The young man finally fell to the ground, vomiting blood.</p>
 <p>“You have lost. This is already the tenth move and if you continue fighting, your life will be at risk.” Guan Yue spoke and flew back to his seat.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue already had the extraordinary bearing of an aristocratic descendant. Now that he won the match, the majority of the audience sang praises of him.</p>
 <p>“Look at him, what an elegant young master. His behavior is graceful and elegant. After being insulted, he can still restrain himself after defeating his enemy…”</p>
 <p>“I agree! In my opinion, the merchant’s son is a disgrace! Compare the both of them… Tsk tsk tsk. I can’t stand the sight of the merchant’s son anymore.”</p>
 <p>“Why is there a need to rank the four occupations? That young master might be a descendant of a declined clan, but his clan’s culture isn’t something that can be compared with the merchants smell of smelly copper.”<span id="footnote-ref-2b21"><a href="#footnote-2b21">[1]</a></span></p>
 <p>Hearing the criticisms from the crowd, the merchant’s son was enraged. It was too bad he was too weak to open his mouth. He could only scream in his heart: <em>No! It shouldn’t be like this! I should be the one they are praising! All of you have to rely on my father’s business to make a living. What gives you the right to criticize me?!</em></p>
 <p>The young man became even more unstable and his rage clouded his judgement. Because of the heavy injury, he vomited another mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p>He didn’t understand that his father was the one who owned the business, not him. His father might be able to help him out for now, but what was he going to do when his father passed away?</p>
 <p>Even after getting showered with praises from the crowd, Guan Yue didn’t grow smug or conceited. A composed and indifferent expression remained on his face.</p>
 <p>“Not bad, you got some skills. You should have said something earlier and not make all of us worry for you. Aren’t you embarrassed?” After Guan Yue returned, Ying Lan made fun of him.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue heard Ying Lan’s complaint and rubbed his nose in embarrassment. “There is a saying that goes, ‘Once a disciple is taught, the master will starve to death.’ I have to keep a trump card up my sleeve. Furthermore, I have already revealed my trump card to all of you. May I be so daring as to ask Commander Ying Lan if I am qualified to join the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence?”</p>
 <p>Ying Lan punched Guan Yue’s chest in response, “Are you showing off after trashing that joke of a kid? Look at yourself. You’re handsome, but you put on the face of a dead fish all the time. Are you trying to intimidate everyone you see? Can’t you smile more?”</p>
 <p>“In my opinion, it is better for him not to smile.” Meng Luoping followed up with a comment.</p>
 <p>The members of the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence all looked at Meng Luoping with a confused expression as they didn’t know the reason behind his comment.</p>
 <p>“Think about it, we have been working together for such a long time… think about the time you last saw him smile. That’s right. Look at how he smiled earlier. After smiling, he sent his opponent to the entrance of hell. Just a step further and his opponent would be having a meeting with the king of the netherworld. It’s better for all of us if he doesn't smile. It won’t be worth it if he kills you after smiling at you.”</p>
 <p>As soon as Meng Luoping explained himself, the members of the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence erupted with laughter.</p>
 <p>On the other side, Pei Qingfeng was rather surprised that Guan Yue was such a strong cultivator. He turned to Bai Luochu and asked, “According to the rules, this foolishly conceited young man is going to be expelled by the Phoenix King Valley. The other young master will be able to enter the Phoenix King Valley… Haha, that brat is going to learn a good lesson this time. He should stop acting so arrogantly in case he loses his life. To be honest, I feel that it will be a waste for that white-clothed young master to join the Phoenix King Valley.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu stared at Guan Yue as she was unaware of his prowess. He had actually concealed his skills from Ying Lan and herself. However, she couldn’t find fault with him as it was reasonable for one to save a trump card in times of need. Now that he was willing to reveal himself, it meant that he trusted the members of the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence. It was a good thing.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng saw Bai Luochu’s blank expression and he waved his hand to catch her attention. “What are you staring blankly at? You didn’t answer my question.”</p>
 <p>“What did you ask me?” Bai Luochu finally came back to her senses.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng wanted to roll his eyes at Bai Luochu but was afraid that he might anger this lass again. He maintained his composure and repeated himself, “Do you think that the Phoenix King Valley will forsake the merchant’s son and replace him with the white-clothed young man?”</p>
 <p>“The Phoenix King Valley will feel that they are suffering a loss if they don’t take advantage of the situation. They are definitely going to recruit Guan… that white-clothed man as a disciple. They won’t forsake the merchant’s son either. In my opinion, they will let the merchant’s son withdraw from their faction for now and after this commotion is over, they will send someone to pick him up.” Bai Luochu spoke realistically.</p>
 <p>“That is what I had in mind. Do you think the prideful white-clothed young man will act according to the script written by the Phoenix King Valley?”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu smiled as she felt that Pei Qingfeng was treating her as a prophet. She replied ambiguously, “I don’t know… If he admires the Phoenix King Valley, who will be able to stop him?”</p>
