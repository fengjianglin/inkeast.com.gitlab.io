 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is no need for formalities. Do you have information regarding Luo Chu?” Pei Qingfeng might be impatient but he acted composed and indifferent as though he wasn’t looking forward to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That secret guard didn’t immediately reply and hesitated for a very long time. When he returned to the residence earlier, he had contemplated for a long time if he wanted to inform his master or not. The matter of Young Lady Luo Chu getting close to the First Prince was something that might infuriate his master and he might be the first person to suffer Pei Qingfeng’s punishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is going on? Did something happen to her?” Pei Qingfeng was seated properly on the chair at the beginning. However, he became uneasy when he saw that his guard was hesitating. He assumed that the guard was afraid of speaking as he would have to face the wrath of the Second Prince. Pei Qingfeng leaned forward in his seat as an anxious expression appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The secret guard quickly denied, “No no, this subordinate is thinking about how to break the news...” After looking at Pei Qingfeng’s reaction, the secret guard no longer dared to withhold the information. No matter what, his master wouldn’t take his rage out on a secret guard, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hurry up and say it. Since when have you been so wishy washy?” After hearing that nothing was wrong with Bai Luochu, Pei Qingfeng immediately reproached the secret guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the secret guard saw how Pei Qingfeng was so insistent, he knew that he had no way to conceal the matter any longer. He braced himself and started to report, “Master, I have been monitoring Young Lady Luo Chu and initially, there were no problems other than her making frequent trips to the Remote Paddy Inn. Other than that, she would rest in the residence and cultivate diligently. However, these few days…” The secret guard was a little hesitant when he spoke up to this point and he was secretly observing Pei Qingfeng’s reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pei Qingfeng knew that he wouldn’t be pleased with the news given the way his secret guard was acting. However, Bai Luochu was fine and since it was information related to her, he should at least listen to it. He wanted to learn of Bai Luochu’s recent movements. He leaned back into his chair and ordered the secret guard, “You can just speak freely. I will not blame you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the secret guard obtained the go-ahead from Pei Qingfeng, he didn’t have anything else to consider and immediately informed all the dealings that Bai Luochu had with the First Prince during the past few days. “In response to Master... For the past few days, Young Lady Luo Chu became close to His First Highness and His First Highness would use various reasons to invite Young Lady Luo Chu to the First Prince’s residence. It has been going on for several days now and since the First Prince’s residence has lots of guards no weaker than this subordinate, I am unable to investigate the matter clearly. Initially, I felt that there was nothing strange about it since she had been staying there in the past. After a few days, this subordinate felt that something strange was going on and came back to make my report.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How many days has it been? What kind of reasons?” Pei Qingfeng was forcefully suppressing his anger while speaking to his slow-witted secret guard. It had already been days since this secret guard returned to give a report. Pei Qingfeng wished he could learn of what Bai Luochu had for every meal or even how many hours she had been sleeping for. However, this secret guard of his didn’t seem to know his intentions and if Pei Qingfeng didn’t bother asking, he was sure the secret guard wouldn’t bother reporting. Pei Qingfeng was even afraid that he would have to address her as his sister-in-law the next time he saw her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That secret guard could subtly detect the anger in Pei Qingfeng’s tone and was rather terrified. He started to stutter while speaking, “It has been three days. The first day, His First Highness invited Young Lady Luo Chu for tea. The day before, it was to admire flowers… Today, the reason was to admire some rare object…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Pei Qingfeng could ask anything else, the secret guard seemed to recall something and quickly added on as though he was trying to compensate for his mistake, “Also, when Young Lady Luo Chu returned to the residence today, His First Highness immediately sent another invitation card to the general’s residence. The card seemed to state that he had newly obtained a jade chess set and is inviting Young Lady Luo Chu over to play a game…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bullshit! What newly obtained jade chess set? That chess set of his was given to him by a foreign vassal many years ago. Emperor Father didn’t like chess and Pei Rumo just so happened to rake up merits on the battlefield, thus, Emperor Father bestowed that chess set onto him. He is already so old and has yet to take a wife... Putting aside his murderous aura, he actually extends his talons to catch a young lady... Why is he learning from those nobles in the capital city? He is trying to feast on young grass as an old cow! Shameless! The imperial city of the Cloud Water Nation is truly getting more foul.” Once Pei Qingfeng heard that Pei Rumo had been inviting Luo Chu to his residence for consecutive days, he became furious and even started cussing out his First Brother out in the presence of his subordinates. His elegant demeanor was lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And you!” After Pei Qingfeng finished cursing Pei Rumo, he turned around and pointed his spearhead at his secret guard, “How dare you wait for such a long time before reporting such important information?! Why don’t you wait till the First Prince’s residence starts to hang up the red lanterns before reporting it? Why don’t you wait until they fall mutually in love before informing me?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After letting out a long sigh, he seemed to recall something and continued to reprimand, “Oh, that’s right, I forgot. I am the Second Prince and I don’t need you to report back to me since I will be receiving an invitation from the both of them as well. By then I will have to bring a wedding gift to the First Prince’s residence to congratulate them… I also will have to greet that lass as my First Sister-In-Law…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The secret guard didn’t speak as he quietly stood there to receive Pei Qingfeng’s scolding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are dismissed. Don’t stay here and waste my time. Return to the general’s residence and if something similar happens, report back immediately.” Pei Qingfeng vented his anger and immediately got rid of the secret guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That secret guard might be having a stomach full of grievances but he did report back untimely, thus, he didn’t say anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as he left the study room, he encountered Pei Qingfeng’s personal guard. Seeing the secret guard in such low spirits, he started to tease, “Oh? Isn’t this our secret guard commander? Why are you behaving like this? What’s wrong? Did Master reprimand you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop your sarcasm. You aren’t going to be better off tomorrow. Luo Chu is already of such importance to Master, I merely reported her information a little late and incurred Master’s wrath. He originally said he wasn’t going to blame me, but he ended up showering me with a torrent of abuse. I never knew that he had so much to say.”</span></p>
