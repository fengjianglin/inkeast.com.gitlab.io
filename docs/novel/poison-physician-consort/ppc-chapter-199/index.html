 <p>“Let’s go, we shouldn’t keep them waiting.” Lu Wenshu regained his refined and dull appearance as he started walking forward. It was as if Pei Wuchen imagined the whole part where Lu Wenshu cheered him up.</p>
 <p>Just like that, the group of them advanced in a grandiose manner to the capital city’s number 1 restaurant, the Drunk Immortal Inn.</p>
 <p>“Today, I wanted to invite Divine Physician Bai for dinner. However, Divine Physician Bai wasn’t willing and I had to invite all the other princes. Either way, everyone here is my guest. Order whatever you like.” Lu Wenshu passed them the menu.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu remained seated and simply observed from the side. It was as if everything here wasn’t related to her. The reason she came was to show her respect for Lu Wenshu’s status.</p>
 <p>Everyone else was there for the same reason. None of them were familiar with Lu Wenshu. They insisted on tagging along after Pei Qingfeng shamelessly asked to be invited. The real reason they were all here was because of how bored they were.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere in the inn was rather awkward and it became the Fifth Prince’s stage. He was a person who mixed around with the hedonistic descendants and gangs of scoundrels. They indulged in the many pleasures the capital city had to offer. Hyping the crowd up was his forte. “Young Master Lu is too kind. We are outsiders tagging along for a free meal. Since you are paying for dinner, you should be the one to order.”</p>
 <p>Lu Wenshu no longer tried to argue and he called the waiter over. “Golden Shrimp Ball, Red Braised Pork, Steamed Pork Ribs with Pickled Plums, Squirrel Mandarin Fish... a Scalded Greens with a jar of Nü’er Hong.”</p>
 <p>As he called out the dishes, Bai Luochu’s heart sank. Her face started to contort in agony. Those were the dishes she loved in her previous life. It seemed as though Lu Wenshu had seen through her identity. Bai Luochu wasn’t sure if she would be able to keep it a secret.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Young Master Lu actually has the taste bud of a young lady.” When the Fifth Prince heard Lu Wenshu’s order, he quickly spoke up to make fun of him.</p>
 <p>Lu Wenshu chuckled in response, “Everyone must find it amusing. My old friend loved these dishes. She isn’t around anymore and I can’t change my habit of ordering them. This is why I asked for your opinion.”</p>
 <p>When Lu Wenshu spoke, he stared intently at Bai Luochu. Bai Luochu detected Lu Wenshu’s gaze and she didn’t raise her head. Pei Qingfeng, who had always been paying attention to Lu Wenshu, caught his actions.</p>
 <p>“Haha, it seems like Young Master Lu isn’t sincere enough. Aren’t you inviting Luo Chu for a meal? Why are you ordering things suited to your old friend’s taste? How can this be considered a treat?” Pei Qingfeng was very unhappy with Lu Wenshu’s actions. His words were like barbed thorns and were meant to make things difficult for Lu Wenshu.</p>
 <p>None of the princes had seen this side of Pei Qingfeng. After all, he wasn’t someone who would get close to women. Moreover, he was someone who would treat everyone with respect. Why was he speaking to Lu Wenshu in this manner? Putting aside the fact that the members of the imperial clan knew a thing or two about the old friend Lu Wenshu spoke of… Wasn’t Pei Qingfeng stabbing a knife into his heart?</p>
 <p>“Second Brother, Young Master Lu has already explained the reason behind his action. I know that you are on good terms with Divine Physician Bai but you shouldn’t get angry. Your injuries have only just recovered, please take care of your body.” The one who spoke was the Sixth Prince who had always stood aloof from worldly affairs.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu frowned slightly. She couldn’t understand why this Pei Qingfeng was like a cat whose tail was stepped on by Lu Wenshu.</p>
 <p>“I am angry because of the way he is treating Luo Chu. Has he thought about how she feels? What will others think if they eat together? They are not even married to each other. Now that there are so many of us here, he still called for dishes according to his old friend’s taste. Are you trying to curse Luo Chu because of the matter over the Green Flame Eagle?” Pei Qingfeng was infuriated as he thought about how his brothers were opposing him. However, he seemed to have forgotten that he wasn’t qualified to interfere with Bai Luochu’s life. After all, the Third Prince was sitting at the same table.</p>
 <p>Lu Wenshu felt that Pei Qingfeng was rather strange. He ordered these dishes because he was certain that Luo Chu was Bai Luochu, and these were the dishes she liked. Why would Pei Qingfeng think that he was trying to curse Bai Luochu? It seemed like his guess was right. “It is true that I failed to consider Divine Physician Bai’s reputation. However, I invited all the princes along as well. It is better late than never. However, aren’t you better at ruining Divine Physician Bai’s reputation? You used your injury as a reason to overstay your welcome in the general’s residence. What is your motive for doing so? Your Second Highness better not forget that Divine Physician Bai is His Third Highness’s fiancée and also your future sister-in-law.”</p>
 <p>Seeing that the two of them were about to fight, Bai Luochu had no choice but to speak up, “I am a physician. I am clear about my patient’s injury. Moreover, there is no gender in the face of a physician. His Second Highness was injured because of me. His body has always been frail because of the obstructed meridians in his legs. Had it not been for His Second Highness, I would have died in the Falling Cloud Mountain Range. Taking care of him is my obligation.”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng heard Bai Luochu’s words and raised his head with pride. Immediately after that, Bai Luochu said something which killed his mood.</p>
 <p>“Since the waiter is already bringing the food up, we shouldn’t waste it. Otherwise, we will be showing disrespect to Young Master Lu. As for Your Second Highness, you should head back to your residence in order to prevent more gossip.”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng was about to come up with an excuse but he was interrupted by Bai Luochu’s stare.</p>
