 <p>“What is there to be afraid of? Don’t I still have you?” After Bai Luochu spoke, Ying Lan smiled and shook his head. “If Mistress has any instructions, just let this subordinate know. I will do my best to carry it out.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu wasn’t in a hurry as she explained her actions. “According to my deduction, the Phoenix King Valley is probably trying to recruit me. I am both a godly physician and in possession of the Green Flame Eagle. According to them, the moment I enter the Phoenix King Valley, I will definitely hand the Green Flame Eagle over to them.”</p>
 <p>“As for Feng Wan’er, she should be thinking of bringing me over to the Phoenix King Valley and silently eliminating me when I’m there. After all, the Phoenix King Valley can say anything they want after my death. No matter what, I won’t be in danger for the time being. If I am unable to escape their recruitment, things might go south.”</p>
 <p>“Since Mistress has to go, please give this subordinate your instructions. I will do whatever I can to protect you.”</p>
 <p>“The contest stage is right beside our teahouse. You shall be on standby. If anything happens, I will signal for you.” Bai Luochu instructed.</p>
 <p>Ying Lan was still unresigned, “Mistress, do you really have to go? Can’t you refuse to show up?”</p>
 <p>“The Phoenix King Valley is one of the Three Great Immortal Sects. They are showing me a lot of respect by inviting me. If I don’t go, I will be disrespecting them. Since they are so passionate in their invitation, don’t you think I should bring a gift over?”</p>
 <p>When she spoke, a sinister light flashed through her eyes. Ying Lan silently cursed at them in his heart. <em>The Phoenix King Valley is probably going to fail with their schemes. They are poking the hornet’s nest here and when this is all over, their faces will be swollen after getting stung repeatedly.</em></p>
 <p>Two days passed by very quickly. During these two days, apart from taking care of Pei Qingfeng, Bai Luochu started to cultivate once again. Even if she couldn’t increase her strength, she wanted to be in her optimum state before she attended the meeting.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The day finally arrived and Bai Luochu packed her things before preparing to head over to the contest stage.</p>
 <p>“Mistress, can’t you allow this servant to accompany you? I don’t think there is anything wrong with His Second Highness now. Why don’t you let me go with you? I can take care of you as well!” Cai Ling saw that her mistress was going to deliver herself to her enemies and she felt worried.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu gently patted the servant girl’s shoulder as an indication for her to be at ease. “Don’t worry, Ying Lan will be secretly observing the situation in the teahouse. Nothing will happen. If you head over, they might do something to you if they fail to catch me. If that happens, I will have to risk my life to rescue you. Won’t that be worse?”</p>
 <p>Cai Ling nodded weakly in response. She could only caution Bai Luochu, “Mistress, please be careful and remember not to overdo it.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu smiled and nodded before heading out of the general’s residence and towards the contest stage.</p>
 <p>There was still about 15 minutes before the time stated in the invitation card. On the stage, many of the important members of the Phoenix King Valley, along with the elder, were already seated. Feng Wan’er was among them as well. Right now, Bai Luochu was thinking of giving them a ‘huge gift’.</p>
 <p>When the Phoenix King Valley Elder saw Bai Luochu arriving, he immediately stood up to welcome her. “For Divine Physician Bai to show up, it is truly our Phoenix King Valley’s honor.”</p>
 <p>“I am indebted to Elder’s kindness for the invitation. I am unsure as to Elder’s intention behind it....” One shouldn’t slap a smiling face. Since the elder was treating her nicely, she wasn’t going to act overboard. However, Bai Luochu didn’t know if she could maintain her smile throughout the meeting.</p>
 <p>“Haha, our young friend doesn’t have to worry. You’re here today so that everyone can be a witness. Our young friend is a divine physician who is proficient in both medical skills and poison arts. Our Phoenix King Valley might have some achievements in terms of cultivation, but we have yet to produce an outstanding talent in terms of medicine refinement. Moreover, you seem to have a special bond with spirit beasts. I believe that in the future, you will become a top notch Beast Tamer whose name will shake the world.”</p>
 <p>“This old one heard that our young friend is unable to cultivate because of innately crippled meridians. However, formidable cultivation and supreme strength aren’t the only things people look up to in the world. Alchemists and Beast Tamers are extremely rare professions as well. If our young friend is willing to join our Phoenix King Valley, we will put our hearts into nurturing you. You will be able to quickly develop into a legendary figure in our continent. Of course, if our young friend really wants to cultivate, our Phoenix King Valley is willing to help you clear your meridians.”</p>
 <p>The Phoenix King Valley’s elder threw all his bait out during the negotiation. <em>With so many benefits and advantages, I don’t believe that a greenhorn like you will fail to take the bait.</em></p>
 <p>Never in the elder’s wildest imaginations did he think that Bai Luochu would go against his pre-arranged script. “Haha, what is elder thinking… Can it be that I, Luo Chu, am a person who pursues benefits? I can’t understand the meaning behind your actions. You were the ones who wanted me dead to begin with. Why are you inviting me into your Phoenix King Valley now?”</p>
 <p>The elder was shocked when he heard what Bai Luochu said. When did they go after her life? “What do you mean? If you are talking about the incident at the Falling Cloud Mountain Range, this old one can represent the Phoenix King Valley and apologize. There were too many people and the situation was too volatile. If we unintentionally offended our young friend, we wish you can forgive us.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? It seems like Elder is unaware of the actions of one of your members.” Bai Luochu raised her brows. Even though there was a sunny smile on her face, her voice was cold.</p>
 <p>Hearing her reply, the elder became even more confused. “What does our young friend mean?”</p>
 <p>Feng Wan’er couldn’t hold herself back anymore and she drew her sword. Pointing the tip at Bai Luochu, she raged, “How dare you! You dare to slander my Phoenix King Valley?! Today, I shall do justice on behalf of the heavens by killing you! All your lies will end right now!”</p>
 <p>Ying Lan was standing in a private room of the teahouse and when he saw Feng Wan’er threatening Bai Luochu, he prepared to charge down towards the contest stage.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu was obviously able to sense Ying Lan’s movements and she immediately raised her hand to rub her sideburns. She signaled for Ying Lan to stay calm as she wanted to use this perfectly legitimate reason to deliver her gift to the Phoenix King Valley. Now that Feng Wan’er was unable to remain calm, the bargaining chip in her hand was going to hit them even harder.</p>
