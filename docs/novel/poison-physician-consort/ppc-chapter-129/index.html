 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu wasn't overly delighted in regards to Ying Lan's congratulations. After all, her current strength was obtained through cultivation for the past two weeks as she woke up early and slept late. She was simply reaping what she sowed and her strength was mainly gained through her hard work. It didn’t drop from the sky and there was nothing worth celebrating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Ying Lan was sincerely congratulating Bai Luochu, hence, she responded, “Alright, enough talk. I still have things to handle and shall return first. Tonight, I still have to visit the Silk Flower Pavilion to straighten things out with Guan Yue. If I don’t, he might leave the palace in a fit of rage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu finished her statement and led Cai Ling back. Ying Lan maintained his pose as he cupped his fists to send her off. He only moved after Bai Luochu was far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Luochu was walking on the streets of the Cloud Water Nation’s imperial city, she felt that there were much more people than before. She was in a hurry when she headed to the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence and didn’t have time to look around. Now that she saw it, she realized that the number of people on the streets was more than that when the Phoenix King Valley was carrying out their disciple selection. It was really bustling with activity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cai Ling, is the Phoenix King Valley’s disciple selection still on going?” Bai Luochu was holed up in her room for the past two weeks and was naturally unaware of the rumors spreading around town. She felt that it was abnormal for the capital city to be this lively, thus, she shot a question to Cai Ling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course Cai Ling knew the reason for the heightened activity level but as Bai Luochu had been in seclusion for almost half a month, she was no different from a person who lived in a cave their whole life. It was natural for Bai Luochu to not know anything. After thinking about it, Cai Ling decided to narrate all the information and happenings of the capital city to Bai Luochu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mistress, you don’t know this yet, but the Phoenix King Valley’s outer valley disciples got drunk in the Remote Paddy Inn one day. Even though nothing seemed out of the ordinary for a few people to drink past their limits, one of them started to go on about the true motive behind the Phoenix King Valley’s appearance in the capital city. That night, they revealed all the information about the Green Flame Eagle on the Falling Cloud Mountain Range and how it was going to give birth. They were originally speaking about it in the private room and we assumed that we were the only ones who knew about it. But who would have thought that they would yell out the information on the street as though it wasn’t a secret. The moment dawn broke, the information started to spread and everyone learned of it. First, it was the official and noble clans who obtained the information, but it quickly spread to the factions away from the capital city. Right now, people from all the other nations are here to get a slice of the action.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu heard Cai Ling’s explanation but was still doubtful. She continued to ask, “You mean that all these people are here for the Green Flame Eagle?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Ling nodded and said, “That’s right, these people are the ones who recently arrived in the capital city. I have yet to include those who had already set off for the Falling Cloud Mountain Range or those whose base are even closer to the Falling Cloud Mountain Range.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh.” Bai Luochu couldn’t help but sneer after hearing Cai Ling’s words. She started to complain. “The Phoenix King Valley is getting better and better... They actually allowed their own members to leak the information. This is really hilarious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly. I heard that those few disciples immediately surrendered themselves when the news started to spread. However, their punishment wasn’t severe at all and they got off with a simple warning. No one understood the intention of the Phoenix King Valley.” When Cai Ling heard Bai Luochu lamenting, she revealed all that she knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others might not understand the Phoenix King Valley’s intention, but as the Phoenix King Valley’s ‘old friend’, Bai Luochu understood the Phoenix King Valley’s true intention. Those who caused the trouble were probably outer valley disciples and there were rules in regards to those outer valley disciples when the Phoenix King Valley was established. When the Phoenix King Valley met with any crisis, the outer valley disciples would be the ones standing on the frontlines and the inner valley disciples would take up positions behind them. In nicer terms, the outer valley disciples were positioned in such a way where they could temper themselves. In fact, those inner valley disciples were mostly descendants of officials and noble clans. If something were to happen, the Phoenix King Valley wouldn’t be able to give a good explanation. As for the outer valley disciples, they were merely descendants of mediocre and lowly clans. Even if something happened to them, the Phoenix King Valley could simply settle it with some silver without any repercussions. Right now, they were about to execute their plan to capture the Green Flame Eagle. Cannonfodder was definitely needed and the outer valley disciples would definitely be the ones leading the way. The inner valley disciples would be able to obtain the Green Flame Eagle and avoid all injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the establishment of the Phoenix King Valley, all of them knew how to worship the strong and stomp on the weak. Apart from a few righteous individuals, the rest of the people were like jackals of the same tribe. Their actions were so extreme that even Bai Luochu who was from the evil dao couldn’t agree with them. The reason why they could be known as one of the Three Great Immortal Sects was closely related to the two other immortal sects. The dirtier the deeds of the sect, the harder they were to approach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this wasn’t the time for Cai Ling to learn these facts. Firstly, there were too many things that a servant girl like her shouldn’t know. Secondly, it would seem rather stranger for the current Bai Luochu to know so much about the Phoenix King Valley. There were still many things waiting for Bai Luochu to settle and it was best for her to keep her hands off other issues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Luochu reached a conclusion, she instructed Cai Ling, “Why don’t you return to the residence first? I will make a trip to the Hundred Herbs Hall to purchase some herbs. You’ve been busy these few days… you should take a break.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is Mistress not feeling well?” When Cai Ling heard that Bai Luochu was heading to the Hundred Herbs Hall, she assumed that Bai Luochu wanted to get some medication. Cai Ling became concerned all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am not unwell. However, before we can head to the Falling Cloud Mountain Range, we need to prepare some medicine just in case.” When Bai Luochu saw how nervous Cai Ling was, she couldn’t help but laugh and shake her head. Bai Luochu was lamenting the fact that Cai Ling was muddle headed the moment she heard that Bai Luochu wanted to go to the Hundred Herbs Hall. She couldn’t even discern that Bai Luochu was completely fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Ling understood her mistress’s intention and didn’t ask any more questions. She simply bowed and asked to leave, “Will Mistress please be careful and return to the residence as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Luochu saw that Cai Ling had walked far away, she started walking towards the Hundred Herbs Hall. After buying all the medicinal ingredients she required, she rushed back to the general’s residence. After all, she still had to quickly produce medicine with all these ingredients.</span></p>
