 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Second Prince's residence might not be as lively as the First Prince's residence, but they were also silently paying attention to the general’s residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Apart from the constant fights against her cousin, she has been hiding in her room and cultivating nonstop. She is living rather comfortably and I think that her life will be better off without her cousin stirring trouble.” Pei Qingfeng’s personal guard replied according to what they found out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Pei Qingfeng’s understanding of Bai Luochu, he knew in his heart that this lass wouldn’t behave herself like how everyone would like her to. Hence, he asked another question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s it?” He might be asking a question, but his tone was rather firm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the guard saw the confident expression on his master’s face, he understood that Pei Qingfeng already knew of Bai Luochu’s true intention. Right now, he was merely asking them a question he already had an answer to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does my lord know about the recent rumors from the capital, regarding the Falling Cloud Mountain Range?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pei Qingfeng looked up as though he had no intention to look at his personal guard. He nodded as an indication that he knew about the rumor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is said that this rumor originated from the Remote Paddy Inn and apparently, the news came from the mouths of the Phoenix King Valley’s disciples after drinking too much. But Young Lady Luo Chu seems to be rather familiar with the people of the Remote Paddy Inn. This subordinate is bold enough to guess that Young Lady Luo Chu already knows of this. She should be preparing to make a trip to the Falling Cloud Mountain Range. I reckon that she is having some ideas about the Green Flame Eagle. This should also be the reason why she is locking herself up to cultivate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pei Qingfeng smiled and asked, “Are you trying to say that the lass wants to be involved in this mess? How can she do something that doesn’t benefit her? She has no one around her to provide assistance and if she is truly planning to do so, she’s going to throw her life away.” After finishing his statement, Pei Qingfeng shook his head helplessly and seemed to sigh at Bai Luochu’s fearlessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His personal guard obviously didn’t dare to say the bolder conjecture in his heart. His guess was that Bai Luochu was starting a faction of her own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pei Qingfeng muttered for a moment before asking again, “Shall we go and join in the fun?” Of course he was referring to heading over to the Falling Cloud Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The guard heard the question and felt like his vision was going dark. He nearly knelt down in front of Pei Qingfeng as he started to persuade, “My lord, right now, your legs are now crippled thanks to Luo Chu’s treatment. Even if you have that elixir to temporarily restore your mobility, don’t forget that the rumor is circulating around the city. There should be plenty of people rushing over there right now. Furthermore, the Third Prince is a member of the Phoenix King Valley and he will possibly be heading there too. If you expose the condition of your legs, I am afraid that you will infuriate His Majesty and the others who will definitely use it against you. You will suffer from the crime of deceiving the Emperor.” When the personal guard saw his master trying to risk his life for a woman, he quickly dissuaded him while silently cursing Bai Luochu in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She is really a femme fatale...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pei Qingfeng’s brows arched upwards as he turned to look at the guard. He merely took a glance and turned his sight back onto the cup of cold tea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After sipping on his cup of tea, he said, “Do you think that Emperor Father doesn’t know about this? After Emperor Father learns of this, do you think he will send us princes there? The Phoenix King Valley might be very respectful towards the Cloud Water Nation, but they still covered up the truth. Emperor Father is a ruler who will pursue profit and avoid disaster. Previously the Phoenix King Valley said that there were spirit beasts anomalies in the Falling Cloud Mountain Range and that they were sent to suppress them. Emperor Father had responded to them politely and didn’t speak of it any further. Now that there is a change in the situation such that we are no longer at a disadvantage, what do you think Emperor Father will do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The guard was speechless for a moment. His master was correct and even if his master wasn’t going because of Bai Luochu, he wouldn’t be able to escape the orders of the Emperor. A worried expression appeared on the guard’s face and he knew that his master was probably the person with the biggest disadvantage if they were to head over to the Falling Cloud Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Pei Qingfeng saw the guard’s miserable expression, he explained, “Don’t worry, if Emperor Father doesn’t say anything, I will definitely not head over. I will continue to behave as a useless cripple in the capital city. However, If His Majesty puts out the imperial decree and orders me to head over, I will have no choice but to go. At that time, I will also provide assistance and protection for that lass.” He was naturally referring to Bai Luochu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the guard heard the words said by his master, he understood that his master was determined to provide assistance no matter what. He no longer tried to dissuade his master as he silently cursed in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Chu is truly the most incredible woman among all the femme fatale, even his master who is comparable to a monk treats her with such high regard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh right, has there been any recent news from the First Prince’s residence?” When Pei Qingfeng saw that they were done talking about Bai Luochu, he immediately asked about his first brother. He wanted to find out the situation over at the First Prince’s residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought about it, Pei Qingfeng’s personal guard couldn’t help but feel a little amused. He suppressed his intention to laugh and answered Pei Qingfeng, “The First Prince's residence is still the same as before. There have been too many people visiting recently and the doorstep is close to collapsing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, he’s definitely working himself to death right now. Did he give those people any explanation?” Pei Qingfeng put down the teacup and seemed to be in a rather good mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s easy for him to send the ordinary people away. He simply said that Divine Physician Bai was at the critical moment of breaking through and required some time to remain in secluded cultivation. But for the Empress Dowager, she asked the First Prince a simple question. “Why is Divine Physician Bai only sending someone to deliver the prescription without coming over to provide acupuncture? Has he turned his back on this old woman?” It was said that the First Prince’s body was covered in cold sweat by the time the words left the Empress Dowager’s mouth. He had no choice but to use all his medical knowledge to explain that after clearing out her obstructed meridians, Divine Physician Bai said that acupuncture might bring out adverse effects if used too often. His excuse was extremely reasonable and even the Chief Imperial Physician from the Imperial Physician Court was fooled.” As the guard narrated the story, traces of mockery could be heard in his voice. He felt that the usually stern Pei Rumo cooked up a rather amusing story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tsk Tsk, it is incredible for him to come up with something like that.” Instead of lamenting, it was better to say that Pei Qingfeng was taking joy in Pei Rumo’s misfortune.</span></p>
