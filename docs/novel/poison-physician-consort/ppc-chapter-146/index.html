 <p>As of now, the originally chaotic battlefield was split into three parts. One was where Lu Wenshu and Ying Lan were fighting. The second part was where most of the people were. As for the last part, it was right beside the Green Flame Eagle where Bai Luochu and the Phoenix King Valley’s disciples were duking it out.</p>
 <p>Feng Wan’er stood at the side of the battlefield and looked at Bai Luochu with an indifferent gaze. She was waiting for an opportunity to assassinate Bai Luochu. Feng Wan’er never imagined that Bai Luochu’s movement skill would be so brilliant to the point where she wasn’t at a disadvantage even when there were so many people attacking her. In the end, Feng Wan’er disregarded everything and joined in the battle as well. Her goal was to lay Bai Luochu to rest in the Falling Cloud Mountain Range. Since she liked the Green Flame Eagle so much, she should just stay here!</p>
 <p>The moment Feng Wan’er joined the battle, Bai Luochu felt that the battle became more intense. She had no choice but to release her spiritual energy in order to continue the battle. By doing so, she would be able to sense everyone’s movement and at the same time, she could use her spiritual energy to pressure them. She would then slowly deal with them.</p>
 <p>She was right. Even though the disciples had powerful spirit qi, their spiritual energy cultivation was far inferior to Bai Luochu. Even Feng Wan’er would be forced back when Bai Luochu targeted her with her spiritual energy. Feng Wan’er had to use her spirit qi in order to force herself to move when faced with Bai Luochu’s spiritual energy.</p>
 <p>Beside the Green Flame Eagle, there were only several people present. Bai Luochu was fighting against Feng Wan’er and several disciples from the Phoenix King Valley. However, as Bai Luochu had to use her spiritual energy to pressure her enemies, her movements were no longer as agile. In Pei Qingfeng’s eyes, she was in serious danger.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu was lucky that the Phoenix King Valley only sent out ordinary disciples this time. They were only able to use their spirit qi to protect themselves. Feng Wan’er might be able to execute some techniques unique to the Phoenix King Valley, but after she suffered from Bai Luochu’s spiritual energy attack, the two of them became evenly matched.</p>
 <p>Over time, Pei Qingfeng managed to notice something wrong. Even though Bai Luochu was struggling against Feng Wan’er, she would avoid the Green Flame Eagle. She prevented the sword qi in the battle from affecting the eagle.</p>
 <p>As for Feng Wan’er she wasn’t restricted by anything. She only had one thought in her mind and it was to kill Bai Luochu. She wanted to get rid of Bai Luochu so that she would no longer face any obstruction. As for that Green Flame Eagle… Heh, in Feng Wan’er’s eyes, the Green Flame Eagle belonged to the Phoenix King Valley and its life and death was entirely up to them. She was merely causing some superficial injuries and as the daughter of the valley master, no one would say anything because of a few injuries.</p>
 <p>One was apprehensive, while the other was fearless. Bai Luochu naturally fell into a disadvantageous situation.</p>
 <p>Feng Wan’er could see that Bai Luochu didn’t want to hurt the Green Flame Eagle and knew that her opportunity to kill Bai Luochu was here. Her attacks became fiercer and it seemed as though she no longer cared whether the Green Flame Eagle lived or died. Sword intent shot towards Bai Luochu and the Green Flame Eagle was affected as well.</p>
 <p>After the Green Flame Eagle suffered more injuries, its cries became louder. In a state of panic, Bai Luochu turned around to look at the Green Flame Eagle’s injuries. In that split second, she revealed an opening.</p>
 <p>Feng Wan’er’s sword changed direction in mid air and she poured all her spirit qi into her sword. She wanted to end the battle with a single strike.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng was extremely anxious and in a fit of desperation, he yelled out, “Luo Chu, be careful!”</p>
 <p>The moment the words left Pei Qingfeng’s mouth, she felt the cold killing qi behind her.</p>
 <p>The Green Flame Eagle had also noticed Feng Wan’er’s killing intent and when it saw how Bai Luochu turned around in the middle of the battle, it cried out loud in order to warn Bai Luochu.</p>
 <p>The call from the Green Flame Eagle ruined everything.</p>
 <p>When Ying Lan heard Pei Qingfeng’s shout, he assumed that Bai Luochu was in danger. He disengaged Lu Wenshu and turned to look at Bai Luochu. In that split second, Lu Wenshu was able to catch his breath. However, the moment the cry from the Green Flame Eagle echoed through the air, Lu Wenshi assumed that someone was going to hurt the eagle and sent out a sword condensed from spirit qi towards Bai Luochu.</p>
 <p>With the cry, everyone stopped moving. Everyone could see the attacks aimed at Bai Luochu. Feng Wan’er’s sword and Lu Wenshu’s spirit qi sword shot towards her.</p>
 <p>By the time Bai Luochu reacted, she was right in front of the gates of hell. Bai Luochu had no choice but to withdraw her spiritual energy as she pushed her movement skill to the max. No matter how hard she tried, she was only able to avoid Feng Wan’er’s attack. Lu Wenshu’s sword sliced down towards her with boundless killing intent. Unable to put up the slightest resistance, Bai Luochu gave up.</p>
 <p>There was a smile on Bai Luochu’s face as she never expected that after her reincarnation, she was going to die in the hands of the killer of her past self. It seemed as though she wouldn’t be able to avoid the fate of dying in Lu Wenshu’s hand. It was a pity that before she could take her revenge, she would die in his hands once again. How annoying...</p>
 <p>The moment she felt Lu Wenshu’s killing intent, Feng Wan’er retreated. She knew that there was no way for her to receive his attack. <em>Haha, it seems like I won’t need to make a move personally to kill this cheap slut</em>. It was really satisfying and Feng Wan’er was almost unable to keep her emotions in check. She almost burst out laughing.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu could feel that the sword made from Lu Wenshu’s spirit qi was about to hit her and she could feel the familiar spirit qi belonging to her ex-lover. At the same time, she felt the ever creeping presence of death. What a coincidence, she was no stranger to any of them. Her expression didn’t change but she lamented in her heart… <em>My life shall end here!</em></p>
