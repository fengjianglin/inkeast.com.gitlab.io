<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu still had a piece of cake in her mouth she had yet to swallow. When she spoke, the words sounded a little muffled. “I will settle everything here first. The Empress Dowager still needs more treatment. Also, I don’t know my true identity. With my less than satisfactory strength, I still need to cultivate for some time. After completing everything I need to do, I will head over to a place meant for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, she was referring to the place where her temple was originally located. She was going to take back the inheritance and she was going to accept all the disciples who were scattered around the world. She was going to kill Lu Wenshu and she was going to make sure the so-called Three Great Immortal Sects were consigned to eternal damnation. She would ensure that those great sects were completely destroyed with no chance for revival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, these were all thoughts in Bai Luochu’s mind and it was impossible for her to speak of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no need to mention that reincarnation was something not of this world. Just the fact that she was an evil dao witch in her previous life would cause plenty of people to carry out massacres in order to get rid of her before she matured. They would rather kill 1000 innocent people than let a single suspicious person get away. There was a chance she would be killed even before she got the chance to take flight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Pei Qingfeng saw how Bai Luochu stared blankly into space, he thought that she was trying to search for the memories she had lost. He then carefully probed. “Do you not know who you are?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Luochu came back to her senses, she nodded towards Pei Qingfeng and explained. “That’s right. When I was at the Bestial Battle Arena, I nearly died to a spirit beast. By the time I woke up, I had forgotten everything. I only knew that I was under the control of the Bestial Battle Arena and that my name was ‘no. 8 human slave’. Soon after, I was brought into the residence. I obtained my medical skills after waking up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu already sensed that Pei Qingfeng was trying to pry into her past. She had no other choice but to think of a story to dispel Pei Qingfeng’s suspicion. In the end, her story was riddled with truths and lies alike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Pei Qingfeng heard Bai Luochu’s explanation, he was struck with a thought. He assumed that Bai Luochu was already skilled in the arts of medicine but they were sealed up deep within her. The seal was only broken due to the life and death situation she was forced into.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu’s explanation had alleviated the suspicions that Pei Qingfeng had in his heart. He originally wanted to tell Bai Luochu about her past, including the situation at the Bestial Battle Arena. In the end, he decided against it as he felt that the brutal truth was too harsh for a young lady to endure. He hoped that she would slowly discover the truth on her own and wouldn’t receive a sudden setback.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are the topics getting so serious? Let’s open up the windows. This place is overlooking the capital and the view is great!” When Pei Qingfeng noticed how gloomy the atmosphere was, he quickly laughed and made a suggestion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who would have expected that the opening of the windows would welcome the sound of fighting on the street?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He immediately saw a group of Phoenix King Valley’s disciples forming an encirclement as they attacked two individuals trapped in the middle. They attacked in twos and threes and even though the two individuals were strong, they were no match for the outstanding disciples from the Phoenix King Valley. After suffering multiple attacks, they fell into a disadvantageous position and sustained several serious injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu’s attention had already been fully attracted and Pei Qingfeng was truly helpless. How could he have expected that his casual action of opening the windows to alleviate the awkward atmosphere would allow this young lady to see such a bloody scene?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Bai Luochu didn’t feel that it was over the top. In her past life as an evil dao witch, what kind of grand fight had she not seen before? This scene right now was truly nothing in comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason why she was paying attention was that these two surrounded individuals seemed rather familiar. One of them had overly prominent silver hair and was actually the reserved, silver-haired man she saw in the Bestial Battle Arena. The other person looked rather ordinary but Bai Luochu felt that his martial arts were somewhat familiar. She had been staring at him until he suddenly moved sideways to dodge the Phoenix King Valley’s sword. That very move allowed her to see his face clearly. He wasn’t someone who stole the techniques from her temple, he was a secret guard who was once her subordinate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu slammed her palm on the table and stood up, shocking Pei Qingfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Pei Qingfeng assumed that Bai Luochu was going to offer her assistance due to her soft-heartedness, she opened her mouth. In a polite and courteous tone, she asked, “Your Highness, can I request a favor from you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pei Qingfeng’s eyelids started to jump. Every time this little ancestor had a request for him, she would use such a tone to speak to him. She might be asking for a favor, but she was emitting an aura that was simply forcing him to comply. She made it seem as though she was going to use her silver needles to pierce through acupoints on his body and it would lead to lethal consequences if he didn’t agree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pei Qingfeng had no choice but to agree. “Fine, speak up. What do you need me to do?” He might have already guessed that it was related to those two surrounded individuals, but he had to confirm his guess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wish for Second Prince to use the excuse of ‘talent appreciation’ to rescue the two individuals from the hands of the Phoenix King Valley’s disciples.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once Bai Luochu’s words left her mouth, Pei Qingfeng knew that this was yet another incredibly difficult task. After all, the Phoenix King Valley was an influential power under the Third Prince. However, since the one asking him was this particular servant girl, he couldn’t just sit by and watch the two of them die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Adding to the fact that he had full knowledge of all the dirty deeds the Phoenix King Valley Valley Master’s daughter commited, he couldn’t bring himself to see the Phoenix King Valley in a positive light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If Second Prince thinks that this will be a difficult matter, I will think of another way to save the two of them.” Bai Luochu saw that Pei Qingfeng seemed to be deep in his thought and assumed that he didn’t want to get himself involved in this troublesome matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Didn’t I give my all when you were in trouble? Right now, I think that even the First Prince thinks we are locusts on the same boat. Is there any difference if I do this additional favor for you? Bring me there. I will save the two individuals from the people of the Phoenix King Valley.” Pei Qingfeng finished speaking and turned his wheelchair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu nodded and immediately pushed the wheelchair towards the fight. At this moment, Divine Physician Bai was acting as Pei Qingfeng’s attendant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, please stop for a moment. This prince has something to say.” Just as Pei Qingfeng exited the teahouse, he immediately asked everyone to stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was still the Cloud Water Nation’s territory and the people in the encirclement were all juniors from the Phoenix King Valley. Their seniors were not present and the instant Pei Qingfeng spoke up, all of them stopped attacking. They waited for Pei Qingfeng’s next course of action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two individuals trapped in the center maintained their position as they were afraid the members from the Phoenix King Valley would resume their attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I truly admire these two brothers. Especially the silver-haired one. I wonder if you heroes can hand them over to me?” Pei Qingfeng might be phrasing his words in a way that was open for discussion, but his tone told them that a request was far from what was coming out of Pei Qingfeng’s mouth. They instantly knew that they were not going to succeed in whatever they wanted to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Phoenix King Valley members heard the prince, they felt rather vexed and they didn’t know what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, a voice resounded in everyone’s ears. “Oh? Second Brother is actually interested in fugitives?”</span></p>
