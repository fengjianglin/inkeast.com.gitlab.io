 <p>Bai Luochu charged towards the imperial city with the quickest speed possible as she would only be able to treat Pei Qingfeng when they arrived in the city.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng actually woke up during the trip back. Perhaps it was due to the bumpy ride...</p>
 <p>“Cough cough… Cough, cough.” Pei Qingfeng coughed a few times and blood flowed out of his mouth.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu’s attention was on Pei Qingfeng and the moment he woke up, she opened the curtain. She noticed that his eyes were wide open and she asked with concern, “How are you feeling? Do you feel any discomfort?”</p>
 <p>The moment the questions left Bai Luochu’s mouth, she realized that she was being silly. Her brain wasn’t working properly right now. How could he feel comfortable with such severe injuries?</p>
 <p>When Pei Qingfeng heard Bai Luochu’s question, he chuckled. He knew that she wasn’t thinking straight. He was touched but he couldn’t help but want to tease Bai Luochu.</p>
 <p>“What are you saying? If I feel comfortable with these injuries, won’t I be considered an immortal?”</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu heard his response, she instantly yielded. She muttered to herself, “Just treat it as though I didn’t ask...”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng might be awake now, but Bai Luochu was still very anxious. Judging from Pei Qingfeng’s voice and breath when he was speaking, his condition was pretty serious.</p>
 <p>“Try not to talk. It is better for you to conserve some energy. If I need you to be awake for the treatment later and you pass out, don’t blame me for failing to save you.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu was truly inept at caring for others and her words were rather crude.</p>
 <p>“Haha, are you showing your concern for me? It doesn’t matter, you will surely be able to treat me. If you fail to do so, I won’t feel too sad. After all, I died for you.” Pei Qingfeng was an individual who grew up in the imperial clan. The descendants of the imperial clan always matured at an early age and would understand the special relationship between man and woman. Pei Qingfeng never allowed anyone to touch him and she was the first lady to do so. He understood that Bai Luochu treated him differently. The reason why he wasn’t going all out was because he knew that Bai Luochu wasn’t clear about their relationship. If he scared her off, he would regret it for life.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu might react slower than others in terms of relationships, but Pei Qingfeng had risked his life to rescue her and was saying such ambiguous things right now. No matter how slow she was, Bai Luochu could detect the feelings he had for her. However, because he wasn’t willing to state it clearly, she wasn’t going to assume that he was interested in her. Her hands paused for a moment before snapping the reins again.</p>
 <p>The horses were galloping rapidly and with the sudden stop, Pei Qingfeng nearly flew out of the carriage.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng assumed that something was wrong and he quickly said, “Did something happen? If we are being surrounded, just abandon me and escape first.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu cramped up after hearing Pei Qingfeng’s question. She cleared her throat and replied, “Cough cough, it is nothing. There is a herd of sheep in front of us and it will be bad for me to kill any of them. I stopped suddenly and I hope for Your Highness’ forgiveness.”</p>
 <p>“Sheep? Why are there sheep in the wilderness? Let me see.” Pei Qingfeng trembled as he raised his hand to open the curtains.</p>
 <p>Because it was a random lie Bai Luochu came up with, she couldn’t allow Pei Qingfeng to find out. She held on to the curtain and wouldn’t allow him to open it no matter what. The reason she gave was extremely dignified. “Your Highness still has severe injuries. It is better for you to avoid getting a chill. If you catch a cold, even if I am able to treat you, there might be hidden injuries left in your body.”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng immediately stopped persisting when he saw how insistent Bai Luochu was. He obediently laid down back inside the carriage.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu let out a long sigh of relief when Pei Qingfeng didn’t insist on opening the curtain to find out what happened. She spurred on the horses and made her way back to the city.</p>
 <p>At the city gates, guards were adamant about checking the carriage. Bai Luochu didn’t want to alarm the capital city and thought about how to conceal the fact. However, Pei Qingfeng’s frail voice echoed from inside the carriage.</p>
 <p>“Open the curtain and let them see!” Perhaps it was due to the excessive loss of blood, Pei Qingfeng was panting after he spoke.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu didn’t understand Pei Qingfeng’s intention, but since he gave the order, she knew he had a plan. She opened the curtain and allowed the guards to inspect the carriage.</p>
 <p>“I suffered severe injuries at the Falling Cloud Mountain Range. Had it not been for Divine Physician Bai, I am afraid I would have already…” Because of the long journey and delays on the road, the current Pei Qingfeng was extremely weak.</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu saw Pei Qingfeng’s current state, she became more anxious. She immediately spoke to the guards at the city gates with a severe tone, “Can’t you see that the Second Prince needs immediate treatment?! If there are any delays, the Second Prince’s life will be in danger. If anything happens to the Second Prince, are you going to be held responsible?!”</p>
 <p>As soon as the words left Bai Luochu’s mouth, the guards were terrified. Bai Luochu knew that they were nervous and she calmed them down. “If you can’t take responsibility, open up a path for me to the city. I will provide treatment to His Second Highness right away.”</p>
 <p>The guards didn’t hesitate as they stood to the side and fell to their knees.</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu saw that there were no more obstructions, she yelled, “Everyone make way!” She then hastened her pace into the city.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng noticed that they weren’t en route to the Second Prince’s residence and asked, “Where are we going?”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu replied casually, “All the tools and precious medicinal herbs are in the general’s residence. Even the Hundred Herbs Hall might not have as many ingredients as me. In Your Second Highness’ opinion, is there any other place better to treat you apart from my general’s residence?”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng was astonished as he didn’t expect for Bai Luochu to be willing to expose her identity because of this incident.</p>
