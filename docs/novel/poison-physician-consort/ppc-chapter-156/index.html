 <p>Bai Luochu was outside and she closed her eyes to take a nap. She was really exhausted. Firstly, she rushed to the Falling Cloud Mountain Range without rest. She then participated in a chaotic battle. Right now, because of Pei Qingfeng’s injuries, she rushed back to the capital city without a break.</p>
 <p>The moment she closed her eyes, Bai Luochu recalled the intense battle back at the Falling Cloud Mountain Range. A violent sound of knocking woke her up. Qianqian was too impatient and was afraid Bai Luochu would hide the man if she came a little bit later. She smashed the door down and charged into the courtyard.</p>
 <p>“Luo Chu! Open the door! Get out here!” Qianqian thought she had the upper hand this time and behaved very arrogantly. She yelled confidently as she barged into the courtyard.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu felt a headache when she heard the voice. It wasn’t because she was afraid of her cousin, but because she didn’t want to waste her precious time on such meaningless quarrels. She was tired of dealing with this worthless existence.</p>
 <p>Although Bai Luochu was exhausted, she still opened the door. She wanted to see what kind of tricks her cousin was up to. She was going to treat it as entertainment in order to make up for her past two weeks of hard work.</p>
 <p>The moment Bai Luochu opened the door, Qianqian wanted to rush into the room with her mother. However, Pei Qingfeng was resting in the room and he was a bed-ridden patient with a serious injury. How could she allow Qianqian to mess around as she wished? Putting aside the fact that she would disturb Pei Qingfeng’s rest, she would also be making a fool of herself.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu didn’t hesitate and immediately stood in front of the door. “Why is cousin in such a hurry? Is there something serious enough to warrant you barging into my room? If anyone makes this information public, other people will think that our general’s residence’s education is lacking. They will say that the women in our family are not refined and dignified. How will we face the public in the future?”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu was currently trying to reason with her cousin. The young ladies in the capital city were different from an evil dao witch like her. She was considered an undisciplined individual but the women in the capital, especially the young ladies of the aristocratic clans, would follow the rules inflexibly. Bai Luochu suspected that they would even measure the distance between their steps.</p>
 <p>For a moment, Qianqian was frightened by Bai Luochu’s threat. However, she came up with a reply that stunned Bai Luochu.</p>
 <p>“Hah, cousin is really hilarious. Of course there is something urgent I need to attend to. I am disregarding the proper formalities because of a pressing matter.” When Qianqian spoke, she paid attention to Bai Luochu’s expression as she wanted to detect even the slightest change.</p>
 <p>Seeing how Bai Luochu was maintaining her indifferent expression, Qianqian turned to provocation to force Bai Luochu’s hand.</p>
 <p>“Back to the topic. There are two young ladies in our general’s residence. I might be your cousin, but to everyone outside, I am still someone who received proper education here. If elder sister is to find fault with me, you need to think of your own actions first. After all, if you do something wrong, you will disgrace the residence as well. If my image is affected because of you, don’t blame your younger sister for falling out and turning hostile.”</p>
 <p>Qianqian didn’t forget to laugh after speaking. Her laugh was so fake that Bai Luochu noticed her intention.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu silently lamented the fact that Qianqian’s methods were better than they were two weeks ago. The way she spoke had improved as well. However, it was a pity that no matter how great these skills were, it wouldn’t be enough to exploit Bai Luochu’s weakness. After all, how smart they were was the most important factor. According to Bai Luochu, Qianqian’s head was nothing more than a decoration and her skull was filled with water instead of a brain. It was probably due to her upbringing in the general’s residence. However, when she thought about it, Luo Chu was also really lacking. How could she be suppressed by this bunch of mentally handicapped retards? They were even able to kill her… Didn’t Luo Chu understand the meaning of being cautious? Since she couldn’t cultivate, shouldn’t she be more cautious instead?</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu was a person who had one lifetime’s worth of experience. Even though she allowed Qianqian to run her mouth off, Bai Luochu didn’t show any signs of anger on her face. Instead, she smiled and spoke politely, “Since I am your elder sister, how can I not understand the rationale behind this? Sister really likes to joke. It seems like you are targeting someone with your words… Who are you talking about?”</p>
 <p>It seemed as though Qianqian was still too rash as she snapped at Bai Luochu. “Stand aside, I want to enter the room. I’m talking about you. Let me enter the room and show you your sins.”</p>
 <p>“What if I don’t stand aside?” Bai Luochu’s face turned dark. She was enraged. No matter how well-tempered a person was, if they were repeatedly splashed with dirty water, they would flare-up. Furthermore, Bai Luochu wasn’t someone with a good temper to begin with.</p>
 <p>When Qianqian saw how Bai Luochu was bent on stopping her, she assumed that Bai Luochu was hiding something. She became more complacent and thought that she would definitely be able to gain the upper hand this time.</p>
 <p>“If elder cousin isn’t willing to step aside, you will be admitting your guilt. Elder cousin has never been educated by your parents and doesn’t know what a sense of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor means. However, this sister knows and for the sake of our reputation, this sister must enter the room. If elder sister refuses to give way, don’t blame this sister for being rude.”</p>
 <p>Qianqian shoved past Bai Luochu and wanted to push open the door when she realized she could no longer move.</p>
 <p>“It hurts, let go!” Bai Luochu used all her physical strength and she even utilized some spirit qi. Qianqian was obviously unable to withstand her might and she squirmed with pain.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu heard her but she didn’t care. Increasing the amount of spirit qi, Qianqian felt a mountain pressing down on her.</p>
