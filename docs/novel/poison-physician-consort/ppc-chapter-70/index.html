Bai Luochu’s feeling could come later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That person is the former general’s only daughter… Luo Chu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Pei Rumo’s voice left his mouth there were two people present who couldn’t sit still.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first person was Pei Qingfeng. He didn’t expect for Pei Rumo to be so ruthless and reveal this fact to everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the other person was Bai Luochu. In the beginning, Bai Luochu only felt that the name was familiar. After thinking about it, wasn’t the previous owner of this body called Luo Chu?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu turned to look at the First Prince and didn’t receive any response.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is he feeling guilty about it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been such a long time... Pei Rumo could really keep his composure after hiding it from her for such a long time. If he started off with the truth and added on all the advantages she would be able to obtain if she played along, she would probably allow herself to be used by him. After all, they were simply making use of each other to obtain their goals. But without letting her know in advance, Pei Rumo intentionally used her to strike a blow at Pei Wuchen. She felt that it was truly unacceptable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a moment, Bai Luochu had an extremely awful expression on her face. Luckily, it was blocked by her mask. Furthermore, Bai Luochu would never expose her emotions through her eyes, thus, no one present could detect anything wrong with Divine Physician Bai. All of their attention was placed on the Third Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another individual who didn’t have a pleasant expression and that was Pei Qingfeng. Right now, Pei Qingfeng was feeling extremely uneasy as he could feel the emotional changes in the person beside him. A feeling of guilt appeared in his heart. After all, he already knew everything and if he told her beforehand, she wouldn’t feel so awful right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he was blaming Pei Rumo, he felt that this person was unscrupulous and would use any means to achieve his goal. Pei Qingfeng was currently suspicious and he wondered if Pei Rumo accepted his proposal to bring Bai Luochu here in order to use her to strike a blow at Pei Wuchen. It was no wonder he was so delighted when he asked to bring Bai Luochu along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu instantly lost her appetite. Thoughts flooded her mind... “I am the former general residence’s First Young Lady and the current fiancée of the Third Prince.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she thought about it, Bai Luochu felt that there was something wrong. With her status, how could she have fallen to the status of a slave in the Bestial Battle Arena? It seemed like she had to investigate this properly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Pei Qingfeng saw that the person beside him was in a daze, he thought that Bai Luochu was feeling sad because her fiancé was thinking about another woman. He immediately thought of a way to distract Bai Luochu in order to help her overcome her grief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In my opinion, it is better to just forget about it. This engagement is already a petty and stale topic. No one even remembers it. Third Brother can be at ease. Just bring your beauty home and marry her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Pei Wuchen was also thinking about giving up this engagement. After all, in Pei Wuchen’s eyes, Bai Luochu wasn’t a match for him. He was the current imperial court’s Third Prince and the last disciple of the Phoenix King Valley Master. He was part of one of the Three Great Immortal Sects...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Bai Luochu, she was an orphaned daughter of a declining clan and was a wastrel who had innately crippled meridians. She couldn’t even cultivate! Right now, she was missing and no one knew if she was dead or alive. It was best if she didn’t appear as she might ruin his bright future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Bai, have you been starving for the past few days? Everything in front of you is nearly wiped out.” Pei Qingfeng suddenly raised an unrelated topic as he spoke to Bai Luochu. There were traces of suspicion in his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“First Brother, did you forget to give Divine Physician Bai something to eat? Look at how he is eating as though he is a reincarnated ghost who starved to death! His stomach is a bottomless pit!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone saw how Pei Qingfeng complained about Divine Physician Bai who was like a brother to him, all of them turned to stare blankly at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was true that Bai Luochu had been eating, but it was because of the occasion. Bai Luochu didn’t know what else to do. Furthermore, after the shock Pei Rumo’s words brought her, she had no choice but to keep eating in order to suppress the shock. She had to clear her mind in order to think about what was actually going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The topic of the Third Prince’s engagement suddenly shifted to Pei Qingfeng and Bai Luochu. Pei Qingfeng didn’t let anyone down and started picking on Bai Luochu for the rest of the day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the small feast, there were female singers and musicians who went on stage to perform. No one knew whether or not Pei Qingfeng was possessed as he kept insisting for Bai Luochu to sing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Bai, this is the first time you are attending our gathering. Why not sing a song or two and entertain everyone?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu had been shrinking away and using all sorts of excuses but Pei Qingfeng insisted on making Bai Luochu sing. As soon as Bai Luochu opened her mouth and sang two lines, she was shot down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Bai, what kind of song are you singing? Even the crows in the forest can sing better than you! You better stop humiliating yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another example was the routine segment of pitch-pot and reciting poetry. Pei Qingfeng picked on her as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Luochu pitched the stick into the pot, Pei Qingfeng would say, “Aiyo, aren’t you awfully lucky today? I’m sure you won’t be able to do it again.” When Bai Luochu didn’t pitch the stick in, Pei Qingfeng would then say, “Why can’t you get it in? You’re standing so close and yet you miss... Divine Physician Bai, can you aim?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When it was time to recite poetry, there were even more problems to pick on. When Bai Luochu recited a poem that was easy to understand, Pei Qingfeng would say that it was too vulgar and it didn’t suit Divine Physician Bai’s temperament as it wasn’t refined enough. When Bai Luochu recited a poem that was difficult to understand, Pei Qingfeng would comment that it was overly refined and it couldn’t appeal to the masses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu was at a loss of what to do and it was lucky that no one noticed anything wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If there was someone who was acting strange, it would be Pei Qingfeng. After Pei Wuchen’s engagement was revealed, he had been picking on Bai Luochu for the entire day. Pei Qingfeng was doing so in order to distract her. It was rare for Bai Luochu to submit to such treatment and she didn’t even try to start anything with Pei Qingfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from Pei Rumo, the rest of the princes were like 12-feet tall monks who couldn’t reach their head. They were wondering if Divine Physician Bai Pei Qingfeng were as close as the rumors described. After looking at how Pei Qingfeng treated Divine Physician Bai, all of them had their doubts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pei Rumo understood Pei Qingfeng’s ‘heroic attempt’ and understood that Pei Qingfeng already knew Divine Physician Bai’s true identity. He should also have learned of the engagement a long time ago. Pei Qingfeng was really showing a lot of concern for this servant girl for him to behave abnormally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He truly didn’t expect Pei Qingfeng, who had always placed himself above the commoners, to actually take a step down for a servant girl like Bai Luochu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a flash, the gathering ended.</span></p>
