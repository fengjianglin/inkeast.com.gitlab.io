 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Pei Qingfeng saw Bai Luochu’s response, he shut his mouth in embarrassment and prepared to leave. Before he left, he didn’t forget to remind Bai Luochu, “Don’t forget! Three days later, I will come and fetch you early in the morning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu didn’t even wish to speak to him as she simply nodded. It was an indication that she understood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three days passed in a flash. Just as Bai Luochu finished her breakfast, someone came to report. “Young Lady Luo Chu, the Second Prince’s carriage is already waiting at the entrance. I hope you can hurry up… Don’t let the Second Prince wait for a long time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand, I will go out right now.” Bai Luochu replied and she followed the manservant out of the door. After arriving at the front door, she saw Pei Qingfeng’s personal servant standing in front of the carriag. He even bowed to her when he saw her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Divine Physician Bai, please board the carriage. My lord is already waiting inside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu didn’t say anything and immediately boarded the carriage. As soon as she entered the carriage, she saw Pei Qingfeng seated inside. Today, Pei Qingfeng’s attire was in conformance with the style fit for an imperial prince. He didn’t dress as casually as before and it was obvious that he paid attention to his dressing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Landscape Pavilion is constructed by the mountain. There might be nice scenery but there are definitely snakes, bugs, and little critters. A few days ago, I got the embroidery ladies to stitch up a spice bag. It is filled with spices that can chase those little things away. It doesn’t bring harm to your body either.” Pei Qingfeng finished speaking and took out a spice bag. He handed it over to Bai Luochu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time Bai Luochu received a spice bag from a man and she couldn’t help but feel awkward. She had no choice but to shrink away and say, “I am not that noble of a person. Your Highness had better keep this spice bag for yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could I ask the embroidery ladies to make only one? I am already carrying one and you don’t have to be shy.” Pei Qingfeng spoke and didn’t forget to point to his waist. There was already a spice bag securely fastened to his waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Luochu saw that she could no longer find any excuse to reject it, she accepted the spice bag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When we arrive, you don’t have to answer any difficult questions. First Brother and I will naturally help you out. &nbsp;You are now assuming the identity of Divine Physician Bai and there is nothing wrong with acting a little arrogant.” Pei Qingfeng carefully informed Bai Luochu about the things she should pay attention to and many other things. He was afraid Bai Luochu might expose some flaws during the banquet or might say something wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Apart from the Third Prince, there is no need to be so cautious about the other princes.” Pei Qingfeng had to add this in as he was afraid that Pei Wuchen might find out about Divine Physician Bai’s true identity. After all, they were engaged and it was better to be careful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Bai Luochu’s ears, the words held a different meaning. She felt suspicious about how capable Pei Wuchen was. Putting aside the fact that he could become the last disciple of the Phoenix King Valley Valley Master, he was even able to make this old fox so apprehensive. Today was also the day she was going to officially meet the Third Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu naturally didn’t express the thoughts in her mind. Along the way, Pei Qingfeng would inform her about the things to pay attention to from time to time whenever he thought about them. Bai Luochu didn’t even open her mouth and simply listened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Landscape Pavilion was located at the outskirts of the capital and by the time Bai Luochu and the Second Prince arrived, there was already a group of princes there. When Bai Luochu saw them, she quickly alighted the carriage and paid her respects as these people were members of the imperial clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This commoner pays his respects to all the princes. Today, this commoner caused some delays and hope that Your Highnesses will forgive me.” Bai Luochu sounded like she was beneath all of them but she had a lofty and unyielding character no one could ignore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immediately after, one of the princes responded amiably, “Divine Physician Bai is too serious. You are now a benefactor in the capital city and we are just ordinary folks. How can we pick on you just because of this? Come, quickly take a seat. Today is a rare holiday, let’s not waste such a great time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they exchanged pleasantries, all of them slowly took their seat. During this period of time, someone actually asked Bai Luochu to take the first seat but had been tactfully declined by her. In the end, someone proposed that there shouldn’t be a main seat. Everyone was able to take any seat they wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, Bai Luochu sat in-between Pei Rumo and Pei Qingfeng. After all, Divine Physician Bai was actually brought over by the First Prince. He also had a great relationship with the Second Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about it, the Fifth Prince jested. “First Brother, I have to say… You were the person to look for Divine Physician Bai, but right now, he seems to have a better relationship with Second Brother!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Fifth Prince was simply an idle prince who only knew how to jest. He wasn’t a bad person at heart. If anyone else said this, there would probably be some hostility behind their words. Since Pei Rumo already knew of Bai Luochu’s true identity, he had no choice but to explain calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All these extraordinary experts have their own temperament. Perhaps Divine Physician Bai managed to hit it off with Second Brother. Sigh, I am the pitiful person here as I still have to feed an additional person in my residence.” Maybe because the banquet wasn’t a formal event, Pei Rumo didn’t behave as sternly as before. His originally stiff expression was much more gentle today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Pei Rumo finished his explanation, the banquet roared with waves of laughter. Even though Pei Rumo made himself look bad, everyone laughed and made fun of Pei Qingfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Second Brother, this isn’t the way to do things! Aren’t you going to say something?” The one who spoke was still the Fifth Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seems like this person is really someone who wants to watch the world burn...</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Bai Luochu thought silently in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since that is the case, why not let this younger brother split Divine Physician Bai’s daily expenses?” Pei Qingfeng spoke with a pleasant tone and was obviously not objecting to this topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How can I let Second Brother fork out money? I am the one who invited Divine Physician Bai. It’s nothing for me to cough up some money. The First Prince’s residence can still afford to feed one extra person. Fifth Brother is just stirring things up... Second Brother doesn’t have to take it seriously.” Pei Rumo saw that Pei Qingfeng was also messing around and he played along. In the end, he ended the topic on Divine Physician Bai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey? Is Third Brother not here yet?” The one who spoke was the Seventh Prince who was cultured and refined. He didn’t bother about worldly matters during normal times and only knew how to paint and study.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This morning when I was going out, Third Brother relayed a message to me. He said that there was something he had to handle for the Phoenix King Valley and will be a little late. From what I see, that woman is definitely pestering him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as they were about to make more guesses, Pei Wuchen arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aiyo, the person arrives just as we start talking about him. Since Third Brother is so late, shouldn’t you punish yourself with a few cups of wine?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Pei Wuchen saw everyone heckling, he silently shook his head and smiled bitterly. He didn’t try to shrink away and punished himself with three cups of wine before finding a seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why is Third Brother so late?” The one who spoke was Pei Rumo but his tone didn’t sound as friendly as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu thought in her heart,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;It seems like the First Prince isn’t as polite when speaking to his political enemies</span></p>
