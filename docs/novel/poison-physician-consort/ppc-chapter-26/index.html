 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to be so wary of me. I’m well aware of the situation.” Pei Qingfeng had been secretly investigating the source of this poison by himself. Although he couldn’t be 100% sure, his conjecture should be about right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This kind of poison array seems to have its own consciousness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps even Bai Luochu felt that the situation was rather serious so before she continued, she took several deep breaths. “The poison array in your body is something I read from an ancient book. There is information about this particular type of poison array recorded in it. You might be clear about the condition of your own body, but what I am about to say is something you might not know. This poison array appeared once before and it affected a pair of father and son. The father was adept at both medicine and poison but he wasn’t able to make much progress. In the end, he placed all his hopes on his son.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she spoke up to this point, Pei Qingfeng took over and continued. “But he wasn’t like other fathers who would try to nurture his son. The father chose to plant this poison array in his son’s body as well in order to absorb the spirit qi in his son’s body. The higher his son’s cultivation level, the more spirit qi he would be able to absorb.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was a pity that his son only had mediocre talent for cultivation. Compared to cultivators of the same level, the spirit qi in his son’s body was seriously lacking. Finally, the amount of spirit qi that the father required became too much and the burden he placed on his son’s became too intense. In the end, the son died as all the spirit qi in his body was fully absorbed by his father… Am I right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The air around them which seemed to be starting to come to life suddenly became stiff once again. The air itself seemed to solidify as the situation became extremely tense. Other than the breathing of the two individuals, nothing else could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, the poison array is in my body and if I don’t feel that it is terrifying, why are you being so serious?” Pei Qingfeng opened up his folding fan with a “flap” and spoke as though he didn’t care.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Apologies. This is all I can say.” Bai Luochu immediately understood that this fox probably had already guessed the identity of the person who planted the poison array in his body, thus, Bai Luochu didn’t continue talking about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Pei Qingfeng saw how frustrated this little lass in front of him was, he assumed that she was unhappy because he had interrupted her and told the story in her stead. He tried to console her, “You already know a lot of things. In this world, most of the divine physicians who are known to be proficient in both medicine and poison were only able to see the symptoms of the array. They don’t even know the source of the poison and the way to suppress its effects, let alone neutralizing the array. You’re an exceptional individual for being so knowledgeable at the age of 20.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu felt a little embarrassed. After all, she had lived for quite a long time in her previous life. When she was judged by the Second Prince, she felt somewhat embarrassed. If she took his praise, she would be somewhat of a liar wouldn’t she?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So… you don’t believe me?” Bai Luochu suddenly recalled something. Even though this person in front of her was speaking nicely, there was a trace of doubt in his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even those so-called “divine physicians” couldn’t cure me. Now, a young lady who isn’t even older than me tells me that she can neutralise the poison array in my body… Isn’t it normal for me to doubt you?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pei Qingfeng suddenly felt his temples jolting as he didn’t imagine that she would be able to notice his suspicion. Right now, his words contradicted himself and it felt as though he was raising his hand to slap himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then do you want to treat it or not?! If you do, hurry up and give me your answer and stop wasting my time!” Bai Luochu suddenly recalled that Pei Qingfeng had yet to give her a reply and she directly asked him for an answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She then thought about something else and pretended to be serious as she added, “I am telling you right now, the reason I’m asking for the diagnosis fee upfront is because I’m currently lacking in funds. Poverty stunts ambitions and as such, I am lowering my price. If you wait till I’m no longer short on funds, I’ll cancel the deal. After all, I am the only person who can treat you. Those so-called “divine physicians” aren’t even worth a fart in my eyes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu’s threat wasn’t fake. In her previous life, many people had a kind of restraining fear towards her not because she was an evil dao witch. Instead, it was because she was a genuine divine physician who was proficient in both medicine and poison. As for people who were better than her… they would only be better than her in either the medical field or the art of poison. Not both.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But those righteous orthodox sects naturally didn’t want to beg Bai Luochu as she was an evil dao witch. Hence, they could only go look for those so-called individuals who were proficient in both medicine and poison and invite them to their sects as a divine physician. In Bai Luochu’s eyes, be it their medical skills or poison arts, they were no better than a three year old child and none of them held a candle to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Pei Qingfeng looked at Bai Luochu who was trying to act as though she had experienced much of life even though she was obviously less than 20 years old, he couldn’t make the connection between the lass in front of him and a godly doctor who was proficient in both poison and medicine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She knew that he didn’t believe her, but she was acting so haughtily. Pei Qingfeng felt that it was rather hilarious and laughter escaped his lips.“Pfff, hahahahaha…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu felt that this person was really crazy. Was she really a joke in his eyes?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, am I so…” Before Bai Luochu could ask him why he was laughing heartily, she was interrupted by Pei Qingfeng once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t you feel that there is something different about me today compared to the time when I looked for you? Pei Qingfeng turned a few rounds in the wheelchair and faced Bai Luochu. His hands which were originally on the wheelchair were spread out, as though he was trying to display his condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pei Qingfeng didn’t realize that his current actions made it seem as though he was waiting for Bai Luochu to jump into his embrace so that he could hug her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu truly didn’t have any talent when it came to romance and she didn’t think that his actions were inappropriate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But how could she ignore the fact that Pei Qingfeng was sitting in a wheelchair? It seemed like this fox wasn’t merely adept at scheming. He had great foresight as well. He was also an expert in playing the role of a pig to eat a tiger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a person of his status, when everyone saw him seated in a wheelchair, how could they not be concerned about him? They would definitely ask him about it. Furthermore, everyone was very accustomed to him being in a wheelchair which meant that he was a cripple in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, when Bai Luochu had read his pulse earlier, she didn’t detect any old illness in his body. She knew that the meridians in his legs were even more developed than those of normal people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he was avoiding the topic of treating the poison by using his legs, which she knew was fake with a single glance. He even wanted to win her sympathy... Tsk Tsk, he was truly delusional.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why aren’t you asking me why I’m sitting in a wheelchair?” When Pei Qingfeng saw that Bai Luochu didn’t respond, he continued to ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu simply smiled and she even wanted to mock him. However, when she saw that the amount of people around them was increasing, she quickly pushed the wheelchair away. With Pei Qingfeng’s back facing her, she brought him away from the crowd. Lowering her head, she whispered in Pei Qingfeng’s ear, &nbsp;“Those two sets of herbs are the diagnosis fee for the poison array in your body. If you want to see how your legs can be treated…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she spoke up to this point, Bai Luochu paused. After looking around and making sure that there was no one within earshot, she whispered, “Or if you want me to see if I can treat it so that your legs look like they are disabled to outsiders but are actually completely fine... This is going to cost you extra.”</span></p>
