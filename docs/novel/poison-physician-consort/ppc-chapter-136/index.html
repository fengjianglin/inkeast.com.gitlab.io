 <p>With the Green Flame Eagle at the center, the Phoenix King Valley took the lead and formed an encirclement around it with a 1000 mile radius. The members of the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence and the princes were among the people surrounding the Green Flame Eagle. When Bai Luochu arrived, her attention was placed on the Green Flame Eagle instead of the factions present.</p>
 <p>The Green Flame Eagle was entirely green in color and it was massive. Right now, it could already cover the sky before it extended its wings. It was clear that the Green Flame Eagle was giving birth as it released pitiful groans from time to time. During this crucial moment, no one dared to make a move on it. They glared at it like a tiger watching its prey. They were probably also afraid to take action in case they became a delicious meal for the Green Flame Eagle.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu had a Green Flame Eagle mount in her previous life, thus, she wasn’t as anxious when facing this beast before her. However, that couldn’t be said for everyone else. Right now, Bai Luochu’s eyes were slightly narrowed as she sized up the Green Flame Eagle. The more she looked at it, the more familiar she felt. However, she couldn’t remember where she had seen it before.</p>
 <p>In the beginning, the Green Flame Eagle was prostrating and from Bai Luochu’s angle, she could only see the front and couldn’t see its abdomen and talons. In the next moment, the Green Flame Eagle changed positions and it revealed its gorgeous flame-like talons. A sudden realisation struck Bai Luochu.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu’s thoughts drifted back to her previous life, when Lu Wenshu had been accompanying her every day.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>It was a usual day for Bai Luochu as she scoured the mountains for herbs. During her search, she casually looked around for spirit beasts she could set up contracts with. As the saying goes, ‘it’s not harmful for one to possess more skills’. The same could be said for owning spirit beasts.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu was deep in the forest when she heard a strange voice. When the voice appeared, the Green Flame Eagle who formed a contract with her started to turn restless. Bai Luochu became curious as the Green Flame Eagle had the same personality as her, cold and aloof. She didn’t understand why it was behaving in such a weird manner. Bai Luochu pondered over it for a moment and thought of a possibility. She quickly used the Heaven and Earth Contract to transmit her thoughts into her Green Flame Eagle’s mind, “Is that a cry for help from another Green Flame Eagle? Is it in danger?”</p>
 <p>As soon as Bai Luochu asked the question, her Green Flame Eagle released a loud cry. Without wasting a single moment, she called out to Lu Wenshu before heading straight for the source of the sound.</p>
 <p>The deeper they went, the louder the voice became. The gap in the trees became narrower and Bai Luochu used her hands to pull aside the shrubbery in order to make her way to the Green Flame Eagle crying for help.</p>
 <p>Her determination was rewarded and Bai Luochu arrived just on time. However, when she looked at the scene in front of her, a trace of terror crept up her heart.</p>
 <p>There was a python the size of an adult’s thigh trying to swallow a young Green Flame Eagle. Due to its tiny physique, half of its body was already swallowed by the python. The calls of the Green Flame Eagle became weaker and weaker as the mouth of the python slowly closed around its body.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu didn’t hesitate to offer her assistance. She circulated the spirit qi into her palm and seven swords were formed as they shot straight towards the python. As the swords landed on the snake, it started to wriggle about in pain as it collapsed onto the ground. Due to its size, the ground trembled slightly and soil flew into the air as its humongous body slammed down onto the earth.</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu saw the python crashing down, she quickly went over and sliced open the body and head of the python, rescuing the young Green Flame Eagle. As soon as she completed her rescue mission, she could feel the Green Flame Eagle in her body calming down.</p>
 <p>Taking a closer look, the Green Flame Eagle’s feathers seemed to be in a molting stage and it looked like a really young spirit beast.</p>
 <p>When the Green Flame Eagle noticed that someone had rescued it, it slowly opened its eyes. It never expected to be rescued and had already decided to resign to its fate of being swallowed alive by the python. As it turned its huge watery eyes to look at Bai Luochu, she couldn’t help but think that this young Green Flame Eagle was much more soothing to the eyes than her matured pet... However, the contract was already set up and there was no way she could forsake her spirit beast due to appearances. In the end, Bai Luochu decided to free the young Green Flame Eagle.</p>
 <p>The young eagle seemed reluctant to part and wanted to stay beside Bai Luochu. After all, she was its savior. If it could turn into a contracted spirit beast for such a kind young lady, it would be much better than serving those people who treated spirit beasts as tools.</p>
 <p>“I already have one Green Flame Eagle. If I set up a contract with you, you won’t be able to fully display your talents. It is better for you to leave. You are still young… don’t travel around alone in the future.” Bai Luochu placed the young eagle on the ground and released it back into the wild.</p>
 <p>“Are you really going to let it go?” When Lu Wenshu saw how Bai Luochu released the young Green Flame Eagle, he was surprised as she was someone who contracted spirit beasts in groups.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu pursed her lips before commenting casually, “I already have one Green Flame Eagle. It will be a waste to set up a contract with another one. Why not set it free?”</p>
 <p>Lu Wenshu’s brows arched upwards. “This isn’t an ordinary Green Flame Eagle. The red flame color on its talons is an indication that it probably inherited the bloodline of the Green Phoenix.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu heard Lu Wenshu’s response and her eyes almost popped out of her sockets. “What did you say? That little fellow that nearly became a meal for the python inherited the bloodline of the Green Phoenix? Is that even possible?”</p>
 <p>Lu Wenshu didn’t say anything else and nodded his head silently.</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu learned about this fact, she was shocked and was slightly tempted to recapture the Green Flame Eagle. After all, this was a spirit beast that had the Green Phoenix bloodline! It was extremely rare but when she thought about how she painstakingly trained up her own Green Flame Eagle, she felt that it was unfair for her to discard her old spirit beast.</p>
 <p>Eventually, Bai Luochu decided to set the young eagle free.</p>
 <p>At that time, Bai Luochu was still immersed in the romantic lie that Lu Wenshu fabricated and didn’t notice the expression on his face.</p>
 <p>Lu Wenshu was currently looking at Bai Luochu with a look of suspicion as he thought that there was no way she could be such a kind-hearted person. However, by the time Bai Luochu turned her head, his expression had already returned back to normal.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu abruptly pulled herself back to reality and when she thought about Lu Wenshu, she realized that he had lied to her all along. She felt extreme disgust as she stopped thinking about the past entirely.</p>
