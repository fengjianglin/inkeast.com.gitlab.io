When Bai Luochu saw that the tea in the cup wasn’t steaming, she knew that Pei Rumo must have waited for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu immediately offered her greetings to the First Prince. “Greetings to the First Prince. Your First Highness must have been waiting for a long time.” Her greeting wasn’t to kowtow and seemed like a conventional greeting for people in the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pei Rumo’s brows arched upwards before he placed his teacup down. He waved his hand, “Dispense with formalities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu raised her head. While she was trying to gather information on the Phoenix King Valley at the birthday banquet yesterday night, she was trying her best to stay hidden. Who would have known that Su Luoqing would appear out of nowhere and made Bai Luochu the center of attention? It was difficult for anyone to not notice her. Yesterday, as Bai Luochu was getting tormented by Su Luoqing, she didn’t have time to pay attention to the First Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, she realized that the Ninth Prince was right. The First Prince truly had an imposing presence. Just that the scar above his eye ruined his perfect look. It made it seem as though he was a cold and stern individual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why did you appear at the Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet yesterday night?” The First Prince didn’t beat around the bush and went straight to the topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu was shocked as Pei Rumo didn’t look like he was going to scold her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Replying to the First Prince, I am an old acquaintance of the Second Prince and we happened to meet each other on the streets yesterday. As he had lost sight of his servant, he asked me to follow by his side to serve as his servant girl. After all, the Second Prince is unable to move freely and needs someone to push him around. Considering my friendship with the Second Prince, I agreed to his request. I have never met you ever since entering the residence and didn’t pay my respects to you yesterday. I would like to ask for your forgiveness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After explaining, Bai Luochu stood there quietly and waited for the First Prince’s next move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pei Rumo was still drinking his tea and his face was expressionless. However, he was shocked in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thought about the meaning behind Bai Luochu’s words. She was the Second Prince’s acquaintance? How exactly did Bai Luochu make a connection with Pei Qingfeng? Could Pei Qingfeng also know about her secret?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, the First Prince wasn’t going to investigate how Bai Luochu appeared in the birthday banquet. After all, she didn’t do anything wrong and she didn’t cause any trouble during the birthday banquet either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was due to the fact that she was standing beside Pei Qingfeng that he had to treat the matter seriously. After all, his aloof Second Brother never bothered with women. With his attitude towards Su Luoqing, everyone knew that he treated women with hostility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Chu had truly given him a pleasant surprise. If his Second Brother had known of the promise back then, his Third Brother would probably have a much more difficult journey in the competition for the throne.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Pei Qingfeng didn’t know the secrets behind Luo Chu and Pei Rumo could make use of this slave, she would turn into one of his trump cards. She would be able to restrain Pei Qingfeng at the appropriate time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought about it, Pei Rumo felt as though his tea tasted much sweeter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Pei Rumo was in a great mood, Bai Luochu who was waiting for a reaction started to feel apprehensive. After all, she was the one who came up with this on the fly. If the First prince knew the Second Prince like the back of his hand, he might be able to detect some flaws in her words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is there a need to ask?” Pei Rumo thought silently in his heart. “Luo Chu obviously isn’t as simple as she looked. Yesterday’s birthday banquet… Phoenix King Valley?” Pei Rumo’s originally straight brows arched upwards. If she had other reasons for attending the birthday banquet, it should be because of the Phoenix King Valley, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you think of the people from the Phoenix King Valley?” Pei Rumo observed Bai Luochu carefully and hoped to understand something from her reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why did he suddenly ask about the Phoenix King Valley? Could the First Prince have noticed something?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Luochu was trying to understand the meaning behind his words but she managed to remain completely indifferent.. “In my opinion, the Phoenix King Valley is indeed worthy of their name of one of the Three Great Immortal Sects. In regards to the envoys that arrived… There is nothing more to say about the elder’s strength. Even the juniors in the valley possess cultivation far beyond the people of the same generation and age. As expected, the deep foundation of the valley is extraordinary. The way they dealt with the people during the birthday banquet was polite and they didn’t seem arrogant at all. Of course, all of them showed off the lofty and unyielding character a disciple of an immortal sect would possess.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the First Prince was keeping mum, Bai Luochu came to a conclusion. The First Prince was a resolute and decisive person in the imperial court of the Cloud Water Nation. He was also raised in the palace and naturally had great observation ability of one’s body language and expression. Right now, she was speaking calmly without stress. It would probably be hard for him to see through her expression or her manner of speech.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as she kept it up and spoke as calmly as possible, her lie should be able to go undetected. Of course, it was on the premise that she didn’t go too far with her lie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As expected, Bai Luochu’s calm expression and speech managed to deceive the First Prince. Unable to obtain the answer he wanted, the First Prince became even more suspicious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Does she really not know? Does she think that she is too weak to clash with the Phoenix King Valley?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Pei Rumo knew that Luo Chu had been thrown to the Bestial Battle Arena because she had offended someone. Putting aside the fact that she didn’t possess enough strength and was born with resolute morality, threats and promises didn’t work on her. The person simply threw this lass with crippled meridians into the Bestial Battle Arena as a human slave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the same as leaving her fate up to the heavens. It wasn’t any different from sending her to her death. The person who sent her into the Bestial Battle Arena was killing two birds with one stone. The obstacle would be cleared and they wouldn’t need to get their hands dirty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one could have imagined that this lass would actually be hiding such ability. She was originally at the brink of death after getting smashed by that Fire Lion, but she suddenly executed some strange movement skill to find the Fire Lion’s weak spot, enabling her to kill it in a single blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pei Rumo couldn’t help but think if any of the Phoenix King Valley’s members recognized Luo Chu during the birthday banquet. If they did, things were going to get juicy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone would be taken aback if the identity of the entity that committed such an immoral act was made known. It was precisely one of the entities responsible for upholding righteousness in the world. They were also known as one of them Three Great Immortal Sects… the Phoenix King Valley!</span></p>
