<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When Bai Luochu stepped into the side room, she immediately felt that something was off. She couldn’t help but become alert. After closing the door, she placed her hand on the dagger attached around her waist as she walked deeper into the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The moment she went in, she noticed a man standing in front of her window with his hands clasped behind his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">If Bai Luochu was simply being wary just a moment ago, it could be said that alarm bells were ringing loudly in her head right now! When she was outside the room, she released the rest of her spiritual energy and enveloped the entire courtyard. She wanted to take the chance to check if there were any secret guards monitoring her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">How in the world did this person appear inside her room?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“I wonder who this expert is… To actually sneak into a lady’s chamber deep into the night, is your distinguished self not afraid that tongues will wag? Aren’t you afraid of being caught and judged as a rapist?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The intruder looked at Bai Luochu who spoke about him being a rapist without the slightest fluctuation in her expression. It was good to note that she was an unmarried young lady, yet she spoke about such a thing without the slightest bit of shame. The intruder couldn’t help but lift a brow and let out a chuckle. When he suddenly recalled that there were numerous eyes around this residence, he quickly withdrew his laughter. Instead, his amusement was expressed by his narrowed eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Looking at the person who was laughing at her, Bai Luochu glared at him as thoughts flew through her mind. She wondered about exactly was this person standing in front of her. She also thought about how he was able to enter her room so quietly while staying so calm after being discovered. In her opinion, he was really a shameless individual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When the intruder saw that Bai Luochu was getting angry for real, he quickly apologized. “I disturbed Young Lady’s rest. I was rude and didn’t consider my actions carefully. I hope for Young Lady’s forgiveness.” After speaking, he raised his hands in front of his chest and bowed to Bai Luochu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When Bai Luochu saw that this person spoke rather politely, she didn’t argue anymore and directly asked, “I have never met distinguished sire before. Why is sire looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“I’m not here for a particular reason. I’m just here to look at how Young Lady is doing. If anything, it will be better to say that I’m interested in Young Lady’s movement skills...” When he spoke up to this point, the intruder revealed a probing smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Movement skills? Bai Luochu stared blankly at the man in front of her. She was really worried that her enemies would recognize her movement skills… In the end, it really happened! There was really someone who was suspicious of her movement skills...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Bai Luochu couldn’t help but take two more glances at this individual. He didn’t look suspicious at all. He had extraordinary looks with near perfect features on his face. His back was straight but there was a sickly pale look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As it was deep in the night, coupled with the fact that there wasn’t a single source of light in the room, Bai Luochu could only observe the man under the dim moonlight seeping through her window frame. Ultimately, Bai Luochu couldn’t determine if he was actually pale because of some illness or because of the poor lighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After carefully scrutinizing the intruder in front of her, Bai Luochu had some ideas in her heart. She nodded and let out a gentle smile and said, “Interested in my movement skills? I think that you are more interested in my medical techniques, right? Your Second Highness...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Hearing Bai Luochu’s response, the intruder’s body stiffened for a split second. He instantly regained his composure and asked, “Why do you say so?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Seeing his reaction, Bai Luochu relaxed and walked over to the table in the middle of the room. Pouring a cup of tea for herself, she took a sip before explaining, “This is the First Prince’s residence, it’s not some random residence belonging to a rich noble. This place is filled with experts and considering how you managed to appear in my room, there is no doubt about it. You are not an ordinary person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When she saw the faint smile of the man who was taking a seat in front of her, Bai Luochu resumed her explanation. “There are only a rare few individuals in this Cloud Water Nation who possess the ability to enter a forbidden area like the First Prince’s residence. Going through the list of everyone who is plagued with an illness, there is no one else other than the Second Prince, Pei Qingfeng!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Pei Qingfeng laughed but didn’t deny her accusation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“So, Second Prince, are you interested in my medical techniques?” Bai Luochu laughed craftily and excitement started to bubble in her heart. She stared at Pei Qingfeng as though she was looking at a piece of big, juicy meat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Pei Qingfeng revealed a helpless smile. He felt that in comparison to her medical techniques and movement skills, he was actually more interested in Bai Luochu herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Bai Luochu stretched out her hand and placed it on the table before beckoning Pei Qingfeng with her finger. “Give me your hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Seeing that there were no better ways, Bai Luochu decided to diagnose this patient by feeling his pulse. The spirit qi in her body wasn’t abundant but she should be able to feel his pulse and conduct an examination on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As a physician, Bai Luochu wasn’t concerned about touching people of the opposite gender. She simply reached out and placed her hand on Pei Qingfeng’s wrist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Even though Bai Luochu didn’t mind, it didn’t mean that Pei Qingfeng was comfortable with it. After all, he wasn’t used to being touched by the opposite sex. When Bai Luochu grabbed his wrist, he instinctively withdrew his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“I now have the status of a physician, Your Highness need not bother about the so-called difference between man and woman. Right now, there is only a physician and a patient. There’s no intimacy between a man and a woman… will Your Highness please relax?” In order to allow a smooth diagnosis, Bai Luochu persuaded Pei Qingfeng to calm down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After her persuasion, Bai Luochu pulled Pei Qingfeng’s arm towards herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As for Pei Qingfeng, when he saw how composed Bai Luochu was, he didn’t continue to resist. He allowed Bai Luochu to feel his pulse without kicking up a fuss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When he felt Bai Luochu’s spirit qi entering his body, Pei Qingfeng stared blankly at her as he never would have imagined that he would allow a servant girl whom he had just met to examine his body as she pleased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Compared to Pei Qingfeng, Bai Luochu was even more surprised. She noticed that Pei Qingfeng’s spirit qi was vast and boundless, like an endless ocean. In terms of cultivation, he was definitely much stronger than her. Her measly spirit qi wasn’t even considered a cup of water when compared to Pei Qingfeng’s ocean-like spirit qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When the two spirit qi collided against each other, Bai Luochu instantly turned pale. After recalling that she was the one who volunteered to feel his pulse, Bai Luochu closed her eyes and focused. She braced herself to continue the examination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Bai Luochu could never imagine that Pei Qingfeng had such powerful strength. If she had known how strong Pei Qingfeng was, she never would have taken the risk to diagnose him. However, Bai Luochu was even more suspicious right now. With Pei Qingfeng’s identity, it wouldn’t be a problem to invite a famed physician to treat him if he fell ill. Why would he be walking about with an illness plaguing his body?</span></p>
