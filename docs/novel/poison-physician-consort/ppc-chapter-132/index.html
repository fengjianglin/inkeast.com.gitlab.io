 <p>Compared to the surging undercurrent in the imperial clan, Bai Luochu’s side was abnormally quiet.</p>
 <p>Her uncle, aunt, and cousin had already been frightened stiff by the previous incidents with Bai Luochu. It had been a long time since they sought trouble with her. Her uncle was originally a person who bullied the weak and feared the strong. Furthermore, Bai Luochu didn’t appear in the past two weeks due to her cultivation craze. As such, the general’s residence regained its former serenity.</p>
 <p>Once Bai Luochu returned to the residence, she shut herself into the room and started to refine the antidote for the poison array at the foot of the mountain.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu might have claimed that the poison array was something that she happened to see in an ancient book and felt that it was suitable for the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence’s protection but in fact, it was a unique poison array. Not only could it protect everything inside it, it wouldn’t cause the victim to die. Bai Luochu had researched the poison array for a long time in her previous life before being proficient in it.</p>
 <p>The original intention when she worked on this poison array was rather funny and embarrassing. Back then, the temple’s security was very tight, it would take two hours just to change a shift. There might be plenty of temple disciples, but the temple occupied a massive area. Just the planning of the guard shifts would take up a long time. Bai Luochu was a person who didn’t wish to bother herself with things like this. As such, there were plenty of occasions where people almost broke into the temple.</p>
 <p>This finally made Bai Luochu take the security of the temple seriously. She decided to combine her expertise and everything the temple required. After putting in a great deal of effort to create this array, Bai Luochu finally completed it.</p>
 <p>By the time Bai Luochu refined the antidote, the sky was already enveloped by a thin layer of darkness. There were tiny stars scattered out in the black night sky.</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu noticed that it was already dark, she packed up the antidote and left towards the direction of the Silk Flower Pavilion. Even if Bai Luochu was disguised as Divine Physician Bai, she was ultimately a young lady. Furthermore, if she were to enter the Silk Flower Pavilion with Divine Physician Bai’s identity, she was afraid that someone would immediately stick onto her like glue.</p>
 <p>Thus, Bai Luochu decided to enter from the backdoor directly into Guan Yue’s room in order to speak with him.</p>
 <p>As soon as she entered Guan Yue’s room, she saw Guan Yue enjoying wine alone as he faced the moon. Bai Luochu understood that Guan Yue was feeling extremely gloomy right now and she quickly went over and made fun of him. “Isn’t it boring to drown your sorrows? No matter what, you must call someone when you’re drinking, right?” Bai Luochu picked up a wine cup after she spoke and poured a cup of wine for herself. She downed the entire cup in front of Guan Yue.</p>
 <p>“If Divine Physician Bai is here to console me, you don’t have to do it. There is no need for you to trouble yourself.” Guan Yue drank another cup of wine after responding to Bai Luochu.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu knew that this prideful young man was definitely angry and the words coming out of his mouth were due to his foul mood. Bai Luochu was the root cause of it and she started to explain herself, “That is not true. Nobody Bai is here today to ask for a favor. I was unable to explain things clearly this morning. I wish for Young Master Guan’s forgiveness.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu bowed apologetically after speaking before taking out the antidote she had just made. She handed it over to Guan Yue with both hands to express her respect for Guan Yue.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue was suspicious and he didn’t immediately accept the antidote. Instead, he asked a question of his own. “What is this? Why are you handing it to me?”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu was silently lamenting that Guan Yue was truly hard to deal with. She had no choice but to explain, “This is the antidote used to detoxify the people who will be affected by the poison array around our Palace of Brilliance Resurgence. Hold onto it. It will definitely be useful.” Bai Luochu stuffed the medicine bottle into Guan Yue’s hands after she spoke.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue stared blankly and received the bottle. He still didn’t understand what was going on as he stared at Bai Luochu with a frown on his face.</p>
 <p>“I understand, with your cultivation, it is truly a pity that you cannot go to the Falling Cloud Mountain Range. However, I have more important things that I need you to do. I don’t know how long this trip will take. Our Palace of Brilliance Resurgence has recently established ourselves on the mountain. It is hard to say if the nearby small factions have any intention to put pressure on us. During the trip to the Falling Cloud Mountain Range, Ying Lan and I will not be in the capital and there will be no one overseeing the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence. To a newly established faction, it will be sheer suicide if no one steps up.”</p>
 <p>“What our Palace of Brilliance Resurgence lacks right now is manpower. Therefore, I cannot allow you to head over to the Falling Cloud Mountain Range with us. Ying Lan has been serving by my side and I am clear about his capabilities. This morning, when Meng Luoping volunteered to stay and take care of the businesses in the capital, he solved one of my headaches. Right now, there is one problem left and it’s about how there is no one overseeing the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence when Ying Lan and I leave.”</p>
 <p>“I am truly ashamed. As of now, I am still unaware about the abilities of our members. With no other choice, I chose you to stay behind. I hope you can take care of the palace while we head out.”</p>
 <p>After hearing Bai Luochu’s sincere apology and explanation, the anger in Guan Yue’s heart diminished by a whole lot. However, there was a trace of resentment in his voice as he complained, “Why must it be me?”</p>
 <p>“One of the reasons is that I understand you the most out of everyone in the palace. Secondly, you have the most outstanding cultivation in your age group. If such a person oversees our Palace of Brilliance Resurgence, we will be able to deter the weaklings who come looking for trouble.Thirdly, you have always dealt with things in a steady manner. Because of your family’s situation, you are knowledgeable and experienced. You can deal with matters after looking at the big picture. I only discovered it just now when you were explaining the routes we could take.” Bai Luochu explained everything to Guan Yue.</p>
 <p>“If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have added on anything when we were discussing the plan...” Guan Yue muttered softly and turned to ask Bai Luochu, “How certain are you in dealing with the Green Flame Eagle?”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu didn’t say anything and she unleashed all her spiritual energy onto Guan Yue. He instantly turned pale as he was unable to react in time. Bai Luochu knew that she was too hasty and she should immediately retract her spiritual energy in order not to harm him.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue knew that Bai Luochu’s spirit qi and strength was inferior to him. However, he didn’t expect that she was able to increase her spiritual energy to such a horrifying level during the span of two weeks. She was able to ignore the difference in spirit qi and exert such pressure on him with her spiritual energy.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue understood what Bai Luochu was trying to say and he smiled. “Since I cannot personally go to the Falling Cloud Mountain Range to see the Green Flame Eagle’s true appearance, I hope that Divine Physician Bai will bring it back for me to take a good look at it. Otherwise, I will be staying in the capital city in vain.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu understood that Guan Yue had already agreed to her request and immediately replied. “Young Master Guan can be at ease. I am determined to obtain the Green Flame Eagle and I won’t rest until I do so.”</p>
