 <p>Bai Luochu removed the bandage on Pei Qingfeng’s body and realized that a scab was already forming.</p>
 <p>“Eh?” Bai Luochu was rather doubtful. “You are recovering rather quickly. If someone takes Lu Wenshu’s attack, he probably won’t be able to recover without half a month in bed. You’re pretty good.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu wasn’t lying. In her previous life, she got together with Lu Wenshu not just because of his gentle and understanding personality. It was also because he was an abnormal talent when it came to cultivation. Furthermore, he had exquisite moves and brilliant movement skills. In Bai Luochu’s opinion, only a person like him was worthy enough to walk alongside her.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu continued to change the bandage and she didn’t raise her head. She couldn’t see the curiosity on Pei Qingfeng’s face. In the next moment, his question came.</p>
 <p>“Are you very familiar with Lu Wenshu?” Pei Qingfeng’s eyes narrowed but a light flashed through them.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu could feel the burning gaze and felt that there was a blade stuck to her back. She was really too muddle-headed. She revealed such a huge flaw in front of this old fox! With how shrewd Pei Qingfeng was, she didn’t know how to throw him off.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Bai Luochu’s mind was spinning as she thought of an excuse.</p>
 <p>“Why aren’t you talking?” When Pei Qingfeng noticed that Bai Luochu wasn’t talking, he became even more suspicious.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu’s hands paused for a moment when she heard the question and immediately explained herself, “If I speak of the reason, I’m afraid Your Second Highness will laugh at me.” After responding, Bai Luochu continued to bandage his wounds.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng was curious and he continued to press her for the reason. “Just say it. We know so many secrets about each other and there is no need to pretend that I am an outsider. If I laugh, I’m not a gentleman.”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng cut off all the routes of retreat Bai Luochu had. He wouldn’t let the matter go unless she gave him a satisfactory answer.</p>
 <p>“Since Your Second Highness has already spoken, I will be unreasonable if I still continue to avoid the topic. Your Second Highness better listen carefully. Don’t laugh at me for overestimating myself.” Bai Luochu was done with the bandages and she raised her head to stare into Pei Qingfeng’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Your Second Highness should know that I have innately crippled meridians and cannot cultivate. I am like an ugly woman who will admire and revere beauties on the street. I’m like a poor but upright scholar dreaming about promotion to a high official position. As someone who cannot cultivate, I admire those who can. I admire cultivation prodigies even more.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu was being honest. After she returned to the general’s residence, she realized that even though Luo Chu was unable to cultivate, there were many books in her room. They consisted of inner techniques and movement skills. Although some of them had errors, it was still able to reflect Luo Chu’s desire to cultivate. The thing that made Bai Luochu most surprised was a book in the corner called《The World List of Outstanding Prodigies》. All the prodigies in the words were listed in the book and Lu Wenshu was one of them. Bai Luochu understood that Luo Chu was truly feeling regretful because she couldn’t cultivate. Hence, she had been searching for secret manuals to work towards her cultivation idols.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that Luo Chu wasn’t able to open up her meridians and start cultivating. Because of this, Bai Luochu felt pity towards Luo Chu. After flipping through the books, Bai Luochu realized that her name was also recorded in this 《The World List of Outstanding Prodigies. After striking off the original comments in the book, she added her own comments with a hairpin.</p>
 <p>“She may be on the path of evil dao, but her heart is benevolent. Her cultivation is profound and she is extremely knowledgeable. She should be the example all women strive for.” Those were Luo Chu’s words.</p>
 <p>It seemed like Bai Luochu was brought together with Luo Chu by fate. Luo Chu had treated Bai Luochu as a role model and Bai Luochu took over her body. This way, Bai Luochu managed to somehow fulfill Luo Chu’s wish. There would be a day when Bai Luochu would spread Luo Chu’s name throughout the world.</p>
 <p>“Oh? It seems like you know a lot about Lu Wenshu?” When Pei Qingfeng listened to Bai Luochu’s excuse, he was still skeptical about it.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu wasn’t as nervous as before. She explained, “Your Second Highness doesn’t know this. If I admire a person, I will find out everything about them. Normally, I will visit tea houses and listen to the stories. I heard about Lu Wenshu’s past achievements and can even memorize them. Lu Wenshu is an incredible being in my mind which is why I said what I said.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu revealed a look of reverence when she spoke about Lu Wenshu. Pei Qingfeng wasn’t pleased and immediately chided, “Enough, keep your smitten expression to yourself. You are a lady, how can you be so shameless and express your admiration for a man in front of another man?”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu immediately withdrew her expression when she heard Pei Qingfeng’s words. After all, it was to convince Pei Qingfeng. It seemed like it worked.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng was silent for a second before he felt that life was too boring. He thought of another topic and started talking again. “Before you met me, did you do any research on me?”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng thought that he was speaking to a young lass. Even if she didn’t admire him, he was still an accomplished and outstanding prince. Since she grew up in the capital city, it was impossible for her not to know anything about him.</p>
 <p>When he thought about his reputation, Pei Qingfeng’s eyes were filled with expectation. He hoped that she would say yes.</p>
