 <p>Pei Qingfeng originally wanted to question her but he heard her slow and steady breaths and realized that Bai Luochu was already asleep. Even though she didn’t suffer any injuries, she should be extremely tired. After all, she was taking care of him the entire day. With how alert she was normally, how was it possible for her to fall asleep so quickly?</p>
 <p>If he was able to move right now, he would surely be standing in front of her, examining her from head to toe.</p>
 <p>However, he couldn’t move and could only stand in place and look through the drapes. If he was tired at looking at the drapes, he could also look at the roof beams holding the ceiling up. After a long while, Pei Qingfeng finally felt tired. As he prepared to go to bed, he thought about how he should rest more in order to give Bai Luochu an easier time.</p>
 <p>For the next few days, apart from bathing, Bai Luochu would be in this secluded courtyard, tending to Pei Qingfeng with great care. After a few days, Pei Qingfeng’s condition was finally stable and all he had to do was to wait for the wound to completely heal.</p>
 <p>Early in the morning, Bai Luochu had just finished her cultivation session as she waited for Cai Ling to deliver her breakfast. Looking at Cai Ling running over, she saw how flustered the little girl was as she tripped over the doorstep.</p>
 <p>“What? Why are you in such a hurry? Did something happen?” When Bai Luochu saw Cai Ling falling over, she walked over and asked with concern.</p>
 <p>Cai Ling was still gasping for air and wasn’t able to open her mouth. However, she didn’t want to worry Bai Luochu and she shook her head vigorously as she sucked in several breaths of air.</p>
 <p>When she saw how Cai Ling was acting, Bai Luochu felt that she had to teach this girl a lesson. Of course, she could only do it after the incident with Pei Qingfeng.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu still doted dearly on this servant girl that she had personally trained. She immediately poured a cup of water for Cai Ling as she patted her back.</p>
 <p>Cai Ling gulped down the cup of water and calmed herself down. “Mistress, you haven’t left the house for such a long time… Everyone in the capital city already knows about this!”</p>
 <p>“News? What news? Speak..” Bai Luochu was cooped up in the courtyard for the past few days as she took care of Pei Qingfeng. Other than when she took a bath, she didn’t step out of the courtyard. As Pei Qingfeng was present, she couldn’t receive reports from the Remote Paddy Inn. Bai Luochu was like a blind and deaf mouse these few days.</p>
 <p>Cai Ling found it rather funny and took a good look at Bai Luochu. After all, it was a rare sight to see her Mistress like this. Had it not been for the fact that the news was really urgent, Cai Ling wanted to withhold the information in order to take a good look at Bai Luochu’s expression. After all, Cai Ling didn’t know when she would be able to see this sight again.</p>
 <p>“Mistress might not know this yet. This morning, the majority of the factions that made a trip to the Falling Cloud Mountain Range came back. The… whereabouts of the Green Flame Eagle’s younglings are out.” Cai Ling paused for a second in order to observe Bai Luochu’s reaction.</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu heard the news, she grabbed onto Cai Ling’s arm and asked with a grave expression. “Tell me, who are the ones that took the Green Flame Eagle’s children?”</p>
 <p>Cai Ling knew the importance of the Green Flame Eagle to Bai Luochu. ‘Love me, love my dog.’ It was natural for Bai Luochu to care about the baby eagles. Cai Ling didn’t hesitate and immediately listed out the names of the people who had obtained the Green Flame Eagle’s eggs.</p>
 <p>“The Green Flame Eagle laid three eggs and the Phoenix King Valley obtained one. The First Prince obtained another… As for the last one…” Cai Ling observed Bai Luochu’s expression and when she realized there were no abnormalities, she continued, “The other person is the one who injured the Second Prince… Lu Wenshu.”</p>
 <p>When Bai Luochu heard Lu Wenshu’s name, she felt a burst of disappointment. No matter how deep his affection was, it couldn’t be compared to the value of a spirit beast. How did she fall for such a person in her previous life?!</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu had an unreadable expression on her face and Cai Ling didn’t dare to continue.</p>
 <p>It was so silent the sound of a pin drop could be heard.</p>
 <p>“Even if you want to rescue the Green Flame Eagle’s younglings, you can’t act rashly. You need to be careful. None of the three parties should be provoked. I know that you are anxious and want to fulfill your promise as quickly as possible. However, you need to be alive to do so.” The one to break the silence was actually Pei Qingfeng.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu turned around and addressed Pei Qingfeng, “How did you know about the promise?”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng couldn’t help but roll his eyes when he heard Bai Luochu’s question, “My eyes were closed, but I was still conscious. Of course I heard the conversation between you and the eagle.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu nodded and said, “I am well aware of the situation and I am not a reckless person. I know how to deal with this.”</p>
 <p>“Mistress, there is something else. Apart from the First Prince who went to report to the Emperor about the egg, the rest of the princes returned to their residences. However, the Third Prince entered the palace as well. I wonder what he is up to.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu’s heart started thumping.</p>
 <p>“Why did he enter the palace? Is he going to ask Emperor Father for a favor?” Pei Qingfeng was also very suspicious.</p>
 <p>“Well, you are to be blamed for that. If I didn’t remember wrongly, Your Second Highness yelled my name at the Falling Cloud Mountain Range. Why don’t you guess your third brother’s intention?” Bai Luochu didn’t have the intention to blame Pei Qingfeng, but her identity had been exposed so quickly because of him. She would be lying if she said she wasn’t annoyed.</p>
 <p>The scene at the Falling Cloud Mountain Range flashed through his mind. He suddenly remembered shouting her name and his voice broke, “You mean… Third Brother knows…”</p>
