 <p>Guan Yue was getting very handy at handling such matters. Since the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence sent out their men to the Falling Cloud Mountain Range, Guan Yue single-handedly held up the Palace of Brilliance Resurgence.Guan Yue developed rapidly in this short period of time and was now adept at taking up leadership roles.</p>
 <p>“I wonder if Divine Physician Bai is able to bring the Green Flame Eagle back.” After Guan Yue gave his instructions, he stayed in the courtyard and stared blankly towards the direction of the Falling Cloud Mountain Range.</p>
 <p>After a long time, he snapped back to reality and muttered to himself, “Forget it. I shouldn’t think too much. He always keeps his words… All I have to do is trust him.”</p>
 <p>At this very moment, Guan Yue thought that Bai Luochu was still at the Falling Cloud Mountain Range. He would never have imagined that Bai Luochu caused Pei Qingfeng to suffer such serious injuries. As she had to rush back to take care of Pei Qingfeng, she wasn’t able to bring the Green Flame Eagle back with her. It would take some time before she would be able to return with the Green Flame Eagle.</p>
 <p>After Bai Luochu tended to Pei Qingfeng’s wound, she looked for a blanket to cover him up.</p>
 <p>“With your injuries, you shouldn’t be exposed to the wind. You might suffer from some hidden wounds if you were to catch a cold. If you feel uncomfortable, I will get you another blanket.” As Bai Luochu spoke, she tucked in the corners of the blanket to the side of the bed.</p>
 <p>“I have already administered the medicine and when your wounds start to heal, you can soak in the medicinal bath. The external and internal treatment will allow you to heal faster. There will not be any hidden conditions in your body.” Bai Luochu explained herself. She didn’t want Pei Qingfeng to think that she was slacking off.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng didn’t mind and laughed, “You can treat me however you wish. You don’t have to bother about what I think. I trust you.”</p>
 <p>After hearing what Pei Qingfeng said, Bai Luochu’s face didn’t change. She was already immune to his mushy words. “I am indebted to Your Highness. I will be waiting outside. If you feel any discomfort, call for me.”</p>
 <p>Before Pei Qingfeng would speak, Bai Luochu left the room. She knew that if she were to stay in the room, Pei Qingfeng would start messing about with her. Bai Luochu was also afraid that she would be tempted to mess with Pei Qingfeng as well. However, she knew that he needed to rest and leaving was the best choice.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng was also very disappointed. After all, he wanted to use this opportunity to get intimate with Bai Luochu. He never expected for her to leave him in the room alone. Forget it, forget it. It was better not to press too hard, otherwise, it might end up with the opposite effect.</p>
 <p>“What did you say? Luo Chu came back while carrying a man covered in blood? She was wearing a man’s attire when she returned?” Her cousin listened to the guard servant’s report and yelled out loud.</p>
 <p>The guard servant looked around to make sure that there was no one before he continued. “It is absolutely true. This servant even helped Young Lady Luo Chu to bring the man back to her secluded courtyard.”</p>
 <p>“They are together in the same room in the secluded courtyard?” When she heard the news, excitement bubbled in her heart.</p>
 <p>That guard servant didn’t say anything else and simply nodded.</p>
 <p>Her cousin was elated. She was trying to find fault with Bai Luochu but was unable to dig out the slightest problem as that lass had been hiding in her room for the past two weeks. She was bored out of her mind when such a juicy piece of information reached her ears.</p>
 <p>“You have done well, this is your reward. You may be dismissed, I will go and look for my mother right now.” the young lady placed a piece of silver into the hand of the guard servant before rushing off to look for her mother.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, young lady…” When the guard servant saw her walking away, he wanted to stop her. However, before he could say anything, she was already gone. “There’s still another part...” The guard servant had no choice but to mutter to himself.</p>
 <p>It was true that the piece of information wasn’t complete. The guard servant originally wanted to tell her that the man was probably the Second Prince, Pei Qingfeng.</p>
 <p>If one were to think about it, her cousin was really stupid. If Bai Luochu came back with another man, why would she allow her aunt’s men to assist her? However, the guard didn’t dare to speak of this. It seemed like the young lady was really getting muddle headed.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>It was due to this incident that Bai Luochu’s cousin was made into a laughing stock. Pei Qingfeng even reprimanded her because of how rude she was to Bai Luochu. She was so humiliated that she didn’t dare to leave her room for several days. Furthermore, Pei Qingfeng made a point to spread the incident to the young ladies from the noble clans. Qianqian was reduced to a joke in the capital city.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Qianqian, are you sure you still want to find fault with Luo Chu?” The aunt was truly fearful after several rounds of self-humiliation. In the end, she wanted to make sure that her daughter was making the right choice.</p>
 <p>Qianqian was confused. “Why is Mother so fearful of the consequences? Luo Chu is just a simple lass. Now that the evidence is in front of us, how can she avoid punishment? We’re standing on the side of justice! Isn’t Mother able to deal with all those maids and concubines beside Father? Why are you so afraid of Luo Chu?”</p>
 <p><em>How can you compare Luo Chu to your Father’s unpresentable maids and concubines? Right now, we are the ones wronging her. Furthermore, if Luo Chu finds out the truth, our entire family’s head will roll!</em></p>
 <p>It didn’t matter what the aunt was thinking as she finally agreed to proceed with Qianqian’s plan. They charged towards the secluded courtyard in the general’s residence. They wanted to catch her and give her a big surprise. However, what they didn’t know was that there was indeed a surprise. It was a surprise prepared for them.</p>
