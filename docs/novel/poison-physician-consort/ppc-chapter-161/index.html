 <p>“Mistress, this servant has carried out Mistress’ orders. You can be at ease.” After Cai Ling reported, she took a deep bow.</p>
 <p>“If he wakes up and says that he is feeling uncomfortable, feed him the elixir in the white jade bottle. If he is feeling fine, ask him to rest. Pour a cup of water for him whenever possible. All medicines have a degree of toxicity. He has to drink enough water...” Bai Luochu had enough of her extremely filthy clothes. After she gave detailed instructions to Cai Ling, she immediately rushed towards her courtyard.</p>
 <p>Just as Bai Luochu entered her room, she noticed that the water was steaming hot. She quickly took off her blood-stained clothes and tossed it to the side. She stepped into the tub and soaked her body into the hot water. Maybe it was because the temperature of the water was just right, or perhaps it was because Bai Luochu was extremely tired, she fell asleep in the tub of water.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu woke up when she felt a chill and she realized that the water had already turned cold. After looking around, it was already night time. She swiftly took a cloth and honey locust to scrub herself clean before emerging from the tub and changing into a fresh set of clothes.</p>
 <p>In the secluded courtyard, Pei Qingfeng gradually awakened and his mind was still hazy. Due to the loss of blood and a nap that took up the entire afternoon, Pei Qingfeng felt that his throat was drying up. “Water… Hurry up and give me water.”</p>
 <p>When Cai Ling heard Pei Qingfeng, she recalled the instructions given by Bai Luochu before she left. She immediately poured a cup of water from the teapot and delivered it to Pei Qingfeng’s mouth. The moment the cool liquid touched Pei Qingfeng’s lips, he sucked up everything in the cup. When he felt a little better, he turned to look at the person attending to him. It was as though he changed into a completely different person. He sat up and leaned against the headboard.</p>
 <p>“Where is Divine Physician Bai? Why are you here? Go and get your Mistress! I do not wish to talk to unfamiliar people!” When Pei Qingfeng opened his eyes and noticed that the person beside him wasn’t Bai Luochu and was someone he didn’t recognize, he instantly turned hostile.</p>
 <p>Cai Lin wasn’t angry when she heard what Pei Qingfeng said. However, she still offered a polite explanation. “Your Second Highness, please don’t be anxious. My Mistress provided you with treatment the moment she got back. She didn’t even get the time to change out of her dirty clothes. After making sure that you were asleep, she went back to take a bath. If she were to cause your condition to worsen by surrounding you with dried up blood, her efforts would be wasted.”</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng was stumped by Cai Ling’s explanation. He wanted to say something, but realized that there was nothing wrong with her explanation. He sulked and waited for Bai Luochu to return.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu made her way over as soon as she finished her bath. She was afraid that Pei Qingfeng would wake up and feel uncomfortable. As such, she rushed back in order to provide treatment.</p>
 <p>“Creak.” The sound of the door opening echoed through the room and Cai Ling turned around. She noticed that Bai Luochu had arrived and she asked with concern, “Mistress, is everything okay?”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu noticed that Pei Qingfeng was already up and she rejoiced in her heart. It seemed like she was on time. Otherwise god knew what Pei Qingfeng would do to torment Cai Ling.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu shook her head. “I’m fine. It was too comfortable and I fell asleep in the tub. Did he make a fuss after waking up?”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu might be asking Cai Ling, but her eyes had already floated towards Pei Qingfeng. She wanted to observe his condition and wanted to see if he tried making things difficult for Cai Ling.</p>
 <p>When Cai Ling heard the question, she didn’t complain about Pei Qingfeng in front of Bai Luochu. Instead, she replied respectfully, “Mistress can be at ease. Nothing happened when this servant was taking care of His Second Highness. His Second Highness didn’t feel uncomfortable after waking up. He got a little frantic, but it’s not worth mentioning.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu heard the reply and nodded with approval. “You worked hard. You can head back first, with me around, there is no need to worry.”</p>
 <p>Cai Ling knew that Bai Luochu was dismissing her. As such, she took her leave. Bai Luochu had just bathed and there should be many chores waiting for Cai Ling. Cai Ling simply bowed to Bai Luochu and Pei Qingfeng before taking her leave. Of course, she closed the door behind her.</p>
 <p>“Second Highness’ body is indeed fragile. I can’t even leave your side for a moment.” Bai Luochu saw that Cai Ling had already walked far away and started to mock Pei Qingfeng.</p>
 <p>Would Pei Qingfeng admit defeat? “There is something wrong with Divine Physician Bai’s words. I am a descendant of the imperial clan. Because of my status, there are countless people waiting to take my life. Right now, I am still recovering from a severe injury. If someone uses this moment to deliver a dagger to my chest, I probably won’t be able to hold out. I was too rash earlier and took Divine Physician Bai’s personal servant as an enemy. I have truly sinned and I hope for Divine Physician Bai’s forgiveness.”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu laughed and ignored him. He was obviously messing around. He had seen Cai Ling in the past and there was no way he would mistake her as an enemy. He had assumed that Bai Luochu escaped after saving him and didn’t wish to treat him anymore. As a result, he vented his resentment onto Cai Ling.</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu wasn’t in a hurry to expose him and she started a counterattack. “Oh? Is that right? Second Prince is truly prudent, I really admire you.” Even though Bai Luochu was speaking to Pei Qingfeng, her hands were not idle. She prepared his medicine before bringing it over to the bedside. “Will Your Second Highness please lie down properly?? I am going to change the bandage now. If you really want to live, you won’t go against my order, right?”</p>
 <p>Bai Luochu held the medicine in one hand and the gauze in another. She revealed a smile when she looked at Pei Qingfeng.</p>
 <p>Pei Qingfeng understood that he was being mocked and didn’t speak anymore.</p>
