 <p>Chapter 77 Remembrance: &nbsp;Remembrance of the Desert</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, Situ acted naturally around her the next few days, and Feng Luodi even questioned if he was the shadow she saw outside the tent that night. <i>Even if he did hear us that night, I guess it's best for the both of us if we remain as friends.</i></p>
 <p>One day, they were informed by Zhang Xin that two of the older soldiers in the camp had information regarding the legendary treasure, <i>Remembrance of the Desert. </i>Naturally, Feng Luodi tagged along with Situ as they visited the two soldiers. The soldiers were greatly valued in the camp because of their age and experience with the garrison fortifications, and had stayed on as a soldier despite their ripe age of 60.</p>
 <p>"You're asking about the <i>Remembrance of the Desert?</i> What I know is passed down from my great-great-grandfather through our families."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi swallowed. <i>This is a really ancient story, huh?</i></p>
 <p>The old soldier continued. "My great-great-grandfather was told by his elders that the <i>Remembrance of the Desert </i>was very much like the songs of the sirens. Legend has it that those who lose their way in the desert will hear the call of the treasures, and they will be led to the place where quicksand is abundant. They say that it's a heavenly place, filled with beautiful maidens, refreshing springs and most importantly, troves of endless treasures. But whoever enters the place will be swept away by the quicksand, never to see the light of day again."</p>
 <p>"That sounds an awful lot like a mirage." Feng Luodi mumbled.</p>
 <p>The old soldier laughed. "That's what I think about it as well. After all, it is the desert, and there is never a shortage of quicksand."</p>
 <p>The other soldier rolled up a blueprint of the camp's defences and tried to set it on a high shelve, speaking up as he worked. "My version of the story is different from yours."</p>
 <p>Zhang Xin quickly hurried over to help the old soldier, quietly reminding himself to assign the old soldiers proteges to ensure the passing on of their knowledge. <i>At the very least, the younger ones will be able to help them with their work. </i>The old soldier continued.</p>
 <p>"This story was told to my grandfather by the caravans that traversed the desert. That particular caravan was an extremely experienced group, often travelling between the neighbouring countries through the desert. Once, when they were crossing the desert, the winds suddenly billowed around haphazardly, and the ensuing sandstorm obscured all vision and indication of direction. Helpless, all they could do was to follow the camels as they slowly trudged through the storm. However, they soon realised that the sandstorm was getting bigger the further they walked, and that went against the natural laws of the desert. Curious, the caravan decided to investigate."</p>
 <p>The old soldier stopped at that moment, and under the eager gazes of the rest, slowly took a sip of tea. Then, he continued. "The leader of the caravan led his group in the towards the eye of the sandstorm, and what they saw was unbelievable: a moving palace in the middle of the storm. The leader believed it to be the palace of the gods, and they quickly left for fear of offending the gods. Only when he left did he hear about the legend of the <i>Remembrance of the Desert,</i> but no matter how much he tried, he could never find the moving palace again."</p>
 <p>The rest of them were not, strictly speaking, people of the desert. Unable to fully comprehend what the possibility of a treasure meant for the people, they only treated it like a story.</p>
 <p>The first soldier suddenly turned around and looked straight at Situ. "General, are you investigating this because of the recent disappearances of civilians that have gone in search of the treasure?"</p>
 <p>Situ nodded.</p>
 <p>"May I give you a piece of advice, then? If the <i>Remembrance of the Desert </i>is indeed the moving palace, then please find it and destroy it, before more people lose their lives because of it. However, if it is nothing but a rumour, then you may have to be careful of those around you."</p>
 <p>Situ smiled. "Don't worry, I understand."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi cocked her head, perplexed by the old soldier's advice. <i>I understood the first part, but what was he trying to say with his second sentence? &nbsp;</i>Zhang Xin, Situ and Feng Luodi quickly bid farewell to the old soldiers, and headed straight for the meeting tent.</p>
 <p>On the way back, Situ turned to Zhang Xin. "Have our agents returned? Those that we've sent out to follow the treasure seeking parties should have found the route to the <i>Remembrance of the Desert </i>by now."</p>
 <p>"They haven't, but that's actually good news. That means that they are indeed on to something, and I believe they should be able to provide us with a rough location of the treasure when they return. We will have to find the exact location ourselves, though."</p>
 <p>"We have enough men. Do a sweep." Situ's instructions were simple and short.</p>
 <p>"I understand." Zhang Xin looked serious. "I will not let the North fall into chaos again."</p>
 <p>"Good. If anything happens, send word to the meeting tent. I will be here."</p>
 <p>"Yes, General."</p>
 <p>Only when Zhang Xin was out of sight did Feng Luodi voice her doubts. "I'm sure that not only the people of our kingdom have been lost while looking for the treasure. Why are you guys the ones trying to solve the issue?"</p>
 <p>"That's true, but we, the Xuan people, still make up most of the travellers who are lost." Situ explained as he lifted the flap of the meeting tent. "Besides, any potential danger to our people is to be dealt with as soon as possible."</p>
 <p>"I see. I was wondering why you had made so many arrangements for the investigations despite seeming pretty nonchalant about it at first." Feng Luodi stopped outside, and did not follow Situ into the meeting tent.</p>
 <p>Situ stopped, and turned to look at her. "Come in."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi shook her head. "I just found out from General Zhang that this is against the rules. I think it's best if I abide by the military laws as well."</p>
 <p>"Don't you want to find out about the whereabouts of the <i>Remembrance of the Desert?</i>" Situ raised an eyebrow.</p>
 <p>"I do. Just tell me about it afterwards." Feng Luodi smiled lightly.</p>
 <p>Situ shook his head, and pulled her into the tent. The flap fell back into place behind her. "There's nobody else here. No need for you to abide by the rules."</p>
 <p><i>Hmph! He can be so overbearing at times! </i>Feng Luodi rolled her eyes inwardly.</p>
 <p>"If you have nothing to do, you can help me prepare ink to write with." Situ sat behind the desk and started leafing through the reports, an outstretched hand pointing casually at the inkstone.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi pursed her lips, but obediently prepared the ink for Situ. She cast a casual glance towards Situ, trying to catch a glimpse of his reports. Instead, she found her eyes drawn to his face. <i>This must be the closest I've been with him when he's working! His furrowed eyebrows, his defined nose, his tightly-pressed lips and his intense look is so…charming.</i></p>
 <p>"I'd have to assume that you've fallen for me if you stare at me anymore." Situ's eyes did not leave his report.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi quickly looked away. <i>How can I forget what I'd promised myself that night? But..he is indeed really good looking.</i></p>
 <p>When Zhang Xin and the other officials barged into the tent excited to share their news, they were greeted the warm sight between the two of them. The officials were all older than Situ, and most of them were married with children. <i>Is the strict and stoic General Situ finally falling for someone?</i></p>
 <p>"My apologies for disturbing, General. We shall take our leave." Zhang Xin and the others tried to slink out of the tent.</p>
 <p>"Report." Situ's voice echoed coldly.</p>
 <p><i>Wow! Is he perhaps…embarrassed? </i>Of course, Zhang Xin did not dare voice his thoughts, but quickly reported his findings. "Some of our agents have managed to sneak into the treasure hunters' expeditions, but even the leader of the expedition does not have enough details about <i>the Remembrance of the Desert</i>. I plan to join the expedition in secret myself, and to lead the army there once I return with the exact location."</p>
 <p>"I'll go instead. The Huns are in no condition to make any move on us at the moment." Situ wrote a few words on the report in front of him, and rested his brush on the table.</p>
 <p>"Please rethink your decision, General!" Zhang Xin knelt down on one knee, and the other officials quickly followed suit. "You are too important to be risking yourself in such an endeavour, General! The army of the North is doomed if anything is to happen to you!" Zhang Xin wailed.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi tried to hide her laughter at the actions of the officials<i>. How is Situ so serious, yet his subordinates so cheeky?</i></p>
 <p>"Shut up," Situ said coldly, "my decision will not change."</p>
 <p>"General, don't be so stubborn!" Zhang Xin attempted to change Situ's mind again, but quickly quietened down when he saw Situ's face. Turning to Feng Luodi, he quickly caught her attention and winked furiously at her. <i>Miss Feng! Please, help us convince the General!</i></p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Feng Luodi did not understand him. The officials behind Zhang Xin kept their head down, trying to hold their laughter in as well. They all knew the cause of Zhang Xin's cheekiness: he had recently received news of his wife's pregnancy and spent his days in an uncharacteristic joy. Finally, Feng Luodi caught on to his hint.</p>
 <p>She turned to Situ. "General, your presence is too overwhelming. I believe it's better for the slightly more ordinary officials to participate in this mission instead."</p>
 <p>Zhang Xin's face soured. <i>Miss Feng, why must you use that as an excuse?!</i></p>
 <p>As Zhang Xin predicted, Situ's face darkened even more, reminded of his failure a few days ago. He gritted his teeth. "General Zhang's wife is pregnant with child; she'll definitely worry endlessly if he was to embark on this mission instead."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi saw the reverse effect her persuasion had on Situ, and quickly tried to make up for it. "I…was trying to say that it's better for you to stay in camp, seeing as how you're the Chief of the Army."</p>
 <p>Situ's face softened a little, but insisted on going. Feng Luodi caught his wandering glances towards her, and suddenly came up with an idea. She scooted over to his side.</p>
 <p>"Can't you stay? I'd wanted to learn to ride and shoot from you."</p>
 <p>Situ's face quickly reverted back to his usual stoic expression. He nodded, and turned to Zhang Xin. "Alright. You'll be in charge of infiltrating the expedition. You may leave."</p>
 <p>The officials quickly stood up and followed the confused Zhang Xin out of the tent. <i>Why is Situ so easily persuaded today? That doesn't seem…normal.</i></p>
 <p>Feng Luodi surprised as well. She quickly turned to him. "If you agree to my demands so easily, your stern image amongst the soldiers will be destroyed!"</p>
 <p>"It doesn't matter. They know better than to disobey me." Situ was calm, and a slight smile graced his lips.</p>
 <p>Seeing that smile, Feng Luodi finally understood what happened. "You did it on purpose! You…"</p>
 <p>Situ turned towards her with a blank look. "What are you talking about?"</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi huffed and stomped away from him. <i>Whoever said he was a simple and honest man is as blind as a bat!</i></p>
