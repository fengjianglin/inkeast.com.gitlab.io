 <p>Chapter 122 Cascades: Rain</p>
 <p>Rain always falls when one least expects it, especially when in Summer; the skies can easily change from bright and sunny to a torrential downpour in the span of a cup of tea.</p>
 <p>Hearing of Jiang Moyin's remittent illness, this time more serious than before, Feng Luodi immediately headed straight for his residence, an assistant from Autumnal Ombre quickly procuring a carriage for her.</p>
 <p>"It's nigh impossible for you to get there in the rain, Luodi. Just wait for the rain to stop before you go, alright?" Qi Jianqiu tried to talk her out of it. However, Fei took one look at Feng Luodi's face to know that she was dead set on visiting Jiang Moyin right then.</p>
 <p>"I don't know why it is so, but I have a really bad feeling about this." Feng Luodi patted Qi Jianqiu's hand. "Let's meet again tomorrow. I'll have to check on elder brother right now."</p>
 <p>Qi Jianqiu saw the stubbornness in her eyes and relented. "Alright, but be sure to keep yourself out of the rain. You've barely recovered from your own illness!"</p>
 <p>"Of course; I'll take care of myself." Feng Luodi nodded. The carriage arrived outside of Autumnal Ombre and Feng Luodi turned to Fei. "Fei, get someone to send Jianqiu back home afterwards. I'll head home myself later today."</p>
 <p>"Yes, young miss. I'll see to it."</p>
 <p>As if echoing the anxiety in her heart, the carriage moved along the streets faster than usual. Meanwhile, Situ headed straight for the Feng residence in the torrential rain, unable to contain his feelings any longer. He was dry despite the rain, having his Qi to shield him from the falling droplets.</p>
 <p>The carriage and the rider brushed shoulders along the streets.</p>
 <p>The carriage quickly reached the Grand Tutor's residence. Feng Luodi commanded the driver to drive the carriage into the residence, heading straight for Jiang Moyin's courtyard.</p>
 <p>"Miss, this is the Grand Tutor's residence. I cannot let you in just like that!" Guards quickly followed behind the carriage, attempting to stop her.</p>
 <p>"Leave us!" The head steward quickly arrived and dismissed the guards, leading the way for Feng Luodi. "You're finally here, young miss Feng."</p>
 <p>"Pray tell me, Lu Bo: what has happened to elder brother? I did not hear anything about it!" They quickly arrived outside of Jiang Moyin's bedroom.</p>
 <p>"It's the same illness that has been haunting him all these while, this time stronger than ever."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi's face was scrunched up in worry as she caught sight of an attendant leaving the room with a basin of bloodied water, while another entered with a bowl of medicine.</p>
 <p>"Grand Tutor, it's time for your medicine."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi followed in behind the attendant silently, watching Jiang Moyin on the bed from behind the drapes around the bed. Without a frown, Jiang Moyin gulped down the entire bowl of medicine. He waved his hand in dismissal.</p>
 <p>"You may leave. I'll get up to read some books after resting for a bit more."</p>
 <p>"Yes, Grand Tutor." The attendant backed out of the room, only to see Feng Luodi standing by the door. He quickly greeted her. "My greeting, young miss Feng."</p>
 <p>Jiang Moyin looked up from his position on the bed and his face lit up in a bright smile. "Luodi, you're back!"</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi's eyes were red. She quickly walked over to his bedside. "Elder brother!" Her words caught in her throat as she saw his face up close. His face was pale and pallid, his handsome features gaunt and wasted. The waning of his life showed explicitly and Feng Luodi felt her heart clench at the side.</p>
 <p>"Why are you crying, Luodi." Jiang Moyin sighed, raising a hand to wipe away her tears.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi grabbed his hand. "Why are your hands so cold in the heat of Summer!"</p>
 <p>"Weren't you always like that when you were sick?" Jiang Moyin smiled. "Aren't you embarrassed to barge into the room of a man just like that?"</p>
 <p>"Stop making fun of me, elder brother!" Feng Luodi turned away from Jiang Moyin, wiping her tears away. "What book did you want to read? I'll read it out for you. You can just rest while you listen to me."</p>
 <p>"This." Jiang Moyin held up a scroll of bamboo slat, but it fell from his fingers.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi resisted her urge to cry, quickly picking the slat up from where it landed. She smiled. "You'd best get well soon, elder brother. You're too weak to do anything now."</p>
 <p>"Of course. I'll be well in no time at all." Jiang Moyin laughed.</p>
 <p>Slowly, Feng Luodi began reading from the bamboo slat. Jiang Moyin watched quietly as Feng Luodi read to him, a smile of content on his face. <em>I like this. If only it can be like this forever…</em></p>
 <p>Feng Luodi finished the chapter and turned to Jiang Moyin, wanting to convince him to rest. Instead, she found Jiang Moyin already in a deep slumber. Feng Luodi put her fingers to her eyes and held in her tears, reaching out a hand to help Jiang Moyin lie in a better position. She tucked him into the blankets and took one last look at his sleeping face. Turning to leave, Feng Luodi picked up the tray of cold tea on the table and headed out of the door and was met by the head steward.</p>
 <p>"Lu Bo." Feng Luodi took in a deep breath. "Can you tell me if elder brother's illness can ever be cured?"</p>
 <p>The head steward led her to the pavilion in the courtyard. The rain continued to pour. He sighed. "Young miss Feng, I shall tell you the truth seeing as how much you care for the Grand Tutor - he can never fully recover from his illness. It can only be suppressed."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi forced the next question out of her mouth. "If the medicine he takes is to suppress the inevitable, how long does he still have?"</p>
 <p>The head steward shot a look at her and steeled his heart. "I can tell you, young miss, but you must promise to never let the Grand Tutor know about this. I'm afraid that he will not be able to take it well."</p>
 <p>"Of course, Lu Bo." Feng Luodi stared at the head steward intently.</p>
 <p>"If he takes care of his health, he has another five years to live. But at the rate things are going, he has less than two years ahead of him."</p>
 <p>The tray of tea dropped onto the floor with a loud clang, but Feng Luodi took no notice of it. "Two years?" Feng Luodi murmured. "How is that possible! Elder brother is only twenty-six this year!"</p>
 <p>"I know." The head steward was deeply saddened as well. "The heavens are jealous of his talents. The Grand Tutor is wise and ambitions, but he is tortured day and night by this demonic illness!"</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi turned away from the head steward, doing her best to wipe away the tears that'd come to her eyes. She looked into the pouring rain and seemed to see the charismatic gentleman that'd helped her all those times that she'd been in trouble, with his easy-going demeanour and heartwarming smile. Her tears fell freely.</p>
 <p>"Please do not be sad for the Grand Tutor, young miss." The head steward comforted her. "I'm sure the Grand Tutor does not want to see you like that."</p>
 <p>"I know." Feng Luodi wiped away her tears brusquely with a handkerchief. "But I can't help myself!"</p>
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Situ was already filled with anger at being redirected to Autumnal Ombre, where he met Qi Jianqiu.</p>
 <p>"Luodi headed straight to the Grand Tutor's residence when she heard of his illness."</p>
 <p>"I understand. I will take my leave." Situ replied expressionlessly as he turned his horse away.</p>
 <p><em>She went to see Jiang Moyin first? </em>Situ held the reins. Whirlwind was confused by the sudden change of command and stood on the same spot, pawing on the ground.</p>
 <p>Situ thought for a moment and jerked the reins to the left, in the direction of the Duke's residence. Whirlwind snorted in the rain, confused. <em>Weren't we heading to the Grand Tutor's residence? Are we going home instead now? </em></p>
 <p>They barely made it past one street before Situ suddenly pulled the reins in the opposite direction again. Whirlwind was confused but had no choice but to follow. Another street, and Situ pulled on the reins again. Now Whirlwind was upset, having drenched himself in the rain just to accompany Situ who seemed unable to make up his mind. Just as the rider and horse stood in the rain, both at a loss for what to do, a familiar voice sounded in a passing carriage.</p>
 <p>"Please send me back to the Feng residence; I would not be going back to Autumnal Ombre."</p>
 <p>"Alright." The driver agreed.</p>
 <p>Situ jolted upright, delivering a kick to Whirlwind's torso. Whirlwind trotted forward and blocked the path of the carriage.</p>
 <p>The driver pulled hard on the reins of the horses driving the carriage and glared at Situ. "Who are you? Why are you blocking our path!"</p>
 <p>"What's wrong?" Feng Luodi lifted the veil of the carriage and saw Situ in the rain, sitting high atop Whirlwind. His voice was cold.</p>
 <p>"Get off."</p>
 <p>"Miss? What is happening?" The driver was perplexed.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry; just let me have a few words with him and we can continue on our way." Feng Luodi turned to Situ, a smile on her lips. "What's wrong, your Highness? Why are you not enjoying the company of the beauties in your residence, but pacing the streets in this rain?"</p>
 <p>"You were crying?" Situ's sharp gaze spotted Feng Luodi's red-rimmed eyes.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi was taken aback by his words, but she quickly recovered. "That has nothing to do with you, your Highness. You'd best return home quickly, or your beauties would be starting to worry for you."</p>
 <p>It was at that exact moment that Situ knew he'd made a wrong move back then; now, it came back to haunt him. But he did not bother to explain himself.</p>
 <p>"I'll repeat myself one more time: get off."</p>
 <p>"The rain is pouring, your Highness. Why should I get off when I do not have an umbrella?" Feng Luodi did not miss a beat. "Luodi had assumed that you had understood her words, your Highness. But it seems that you were too dull to comprehend what was said that day; do you need Luodi to repeat herself?"</p>
 <p>A cold light gleamed in the depths of Situ's eyes.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi's smile widened. "It seems like Luodi could be spared the effort. Farewell, then, your Highness." She turned to the driver. "Please send me back to the Feng residence."</p>
 <p>Situ had already brought Whirlwind to the side of the road, and the carriage passed without incident. Feng Luodi let the veil drop back into place and her face became expressionless.</p>
 <p>Situ sat on the horse, not turning once to look at the departing carriage.</p>
 <p>Dusk had fallen and the head steward of the Duke's residence stood anxiously at the gates, waiting for Situ's return. Hoofbeats sounded along the street and he looked up to see Situ and Whirlwind.</p>
 <p>"Your Highness! Why are you soaked again!"</p>
