 <p><span>Chapter 146 Burnt Ends: Circumstances</span></p>
 <p><span>The sudden silence caused Feng Luodi’s heart to stop beating. The men all stared at Situ and waited for his reply. The ladies all stared at her, watching for her reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi gave a simple yet elegant smile and sat upright. The Second Lady gently placed her hand over her’s and patted her lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I was injured and laid in bed for half a month. During this time, I didn’t have the chance to serve you at all. What honour do I have to be able to get such rewards?” Situ said in a cold and calm voice.</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief. Luckily the Duke of Anping handled it in a mature manner and didn’t get proud of his achievements.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor’s eyes were still icy. “You can take it as a consolation then. Please choose something.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone’s gaze returned to Situ. Situ stood up calmly and bowed to the Emperor. “Thank you for your kindness, your Majesty. Since you are so kind, I wish to ask for an item that would bring a smile to the face of my loved one.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Almost everyone turned to look at Feng Luodi. Feng Luodi’s face burned with embarrassment but she still had to smile at everyone. She felt helpless. Ever since a long time ago, he was dying to let the whole world to know about their relationship. </span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor responded with interest. It was a waste that from this distance, he couldn’t see the officials’ families’ expression under the dim lighting.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Since you love your woman so much, I will definitely give my consent. What is it that you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Thank you, your Majesty,” Situ said each word carefully, “it is a zither known as Burnt Ends.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone knew that the daughter of Chamberlain Feng had a huge love for zithers.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor’s smile faded and he signalled to the Imperial Attendant beside him. The Imperial Attendant understood the signal and ordered people to bring the zither from the imperial storeroom. </span></p>
 <p><span>“I remembered it. It was given to me a few years ago by the tribes of the West. A good zither must be used by a good zither player.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ bowed his head and hid his expression while thanking the Emperor again. Very soon, the zither was sent to Feng Luodi. The ladies from the other tables all looked at her with envy. However, they did not dare to say anything. Their families had warned them against provoking Feng Luodi. If they provoked her, they would suffer the same fate as Princess Shangrong.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was engulfed in a whirlwind of emotions. </span><i><span>Situ had just personally sent me the seventh Guqin. If he knew that this zither could allow me to return to the 21st Century, what would he think?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>“Luodi,” the Second Lady called her softly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi woke up from her thoughts and bowed down to thank the Emperor. Then, she started chatting with the people around her again. </span></p>
 <p><span>After a while, the Emperor talked about the second news: the two Ministers would become relatives by marriage ten days after the Autumnal Feast. Everyone could go and attend their wedding that day. The people that wanted to use the issue to create trouble could only shut up after the Emperor had made his decision. </span></p>
 <p><span>The third news followed immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I am very happy with the Eight Prince lately. He is a considerate person and he is filled with integrity. He and Concubine Shu would be in-charge of the Mid-autumn banquet 15 days later.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Eight Prince happily accepted the order. The other officials exchanged glances with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Autumnal Feast was a treat for the officials. As for the Mid-autumn banquet, the main stars are the princes and the dukes. Only officials who are higher than 3rd Rank and with a good record can attend the banquet and visit the Imperial Garden. For the past few years, the banquet was held by the Heir and the Empress. Although the Heir was removed from his position, the Empress was not and the Second Prince was still staying in the palace. Many had thought that the organisation of the banquet would be handled by a few of the concubines but the Emperor gave this honour to the Eight Prince. Although Feng Luodi and Qi Jianqiu were mere ladies, their loved ones were not. Under their influence, they knew some of the things that were happening in court and sometimes gave advice. After hearing the decision made by the Emperor, both of them instinctively started to worry for Situ and Gan Qingjia.</span></p>
 <p><span>This third piece of news caused the atmosphere during the second half of the banquet died down. However, no one caused any trouble during the banquet.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>Dusk soon fell, and the Autumn Banquet came to an end. Feng Luodi carried the Guqin and walked towards the palace gate with the Second Lady. The Feng residence’s horse carriage was already waiting for them there.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, when they reached the gates, they saw Situ standing by the tree not far away, his arms crossed in front of his chest. The glittering moonlight shone on his handsome face. His eyes were like stars and they were smiling at Feng Luodi. </span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi did not know what to do. She did not dare to see him after that day. She won’t be able to control herself but… Feng Luodi looked at the Second Lady.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Second Lady gave an understanding smile and took the Guqin from her. She said gently, “I will explain to your father, but don’t be back too late.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I understand. Please be careful when you go back.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Second Lady nodded and paid her respects to Situ before getting on the horse carriage. As the carriage sped off into the distance, Feng Luodi slowly approached Situ. &nbsp;As she was nearing him, Situ grabbed her and pulled her towards him, wanting to give her a hug. Feng Luodi pushed him away and rolled her eyes at him.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This is the palace gates. All the officials will pass through here.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ felt that she was seducing him with that expression. He smiled gently and held her hand. “Let’s go somewhere quiet then.” He whistled and Whirlwind appeared from a corner, trotting towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ stepped forward, wanting to carry Feng Luodi onto her horse. Feng Luodi took a step back.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I have a curfew. If I go back too late, I will get scolded,” Feng Luodi asserted eloquently.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ ignored her explanation and carried her onto the horse. He then jumped up and Whirlwind immediately started running, leaving the palace gates far away behind it. Feng Luodi felt helpless. </span><i><span>He is so overbearing at times!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>When they reached a quiet street, Situ said, “My hearing is very good.” He was telling her that he heard everything the Second Lady said.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Even if your hearing is good, you shouldn’t eavesdrop,” Feng Luodi argued weakly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ pulled Feng Luodi into his arms and gently rubbed his chin on her head. After a while, he said, “I was listening blatantly. When did you become so clumsy in your speech?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi grunted. Her ears turned red, embarrassed, but still, she allowed Situ to close in on her. Situ looked at the girl in his arms closely. He looked at her eyes and her lips and realised that he’d missed her so much although it had only been three days. What’s more, Feng Luodi actions were amorous to him and he could not keep them out of his head, no matter how hard he tried. He missed her every day and night but if she was unwilling to marry him, she would only be the daughter of the Feng residence. They already had an intimate relationship so why was she still reluctant?</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ was good at coming up with strategies but he just couldn’t figure out why Feng Luodi made such a decision. His gaze fell on Feng Luodi’s face and felt unhappy. However, Feng Luodi was not as cold as last time and seemed very obedient now. His heart skipped a bit as the thought of marriage emerged in his mind again. He moved his lips, “Luodi…”</span></p>
 <p><span>He just managed to call her name when the sounds of swords slicing through the air were heard. However, they were stopped ten feet away from the two of them by his Covert Guards.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was shocked as she stared at the men in black who suddenly appeared. Their eyes were all filled with viciousness. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Don’t look,” Situ covered Feng Luodi’s face with his hand. Feng Luodi couldn’t see what was happening but she could still hear. She heard swords colliding and then, the muffled ring of metal plunging into flesh. Occasionally, there would be a few grunts of pain. The silence of the night was broken. Situ’s Covert Guard were all specially picked and they managed to subdue the men in black quickly. Under Situ’s command, they quickly cleared the scene.</span></p>
 <p><span>Peace returned to the streets.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi grabbed Situ’s hands and pulled them down. She looked at him with concern. His eyes were cold.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Who is it this time?” </span></p>
 <p><span>Situ looked down at Feng Luodi.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Someone who hasn’t given up yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was not satisfied with this answer. She knew that Situ did not want her to be dragged into this but she wanted to know.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s not by the Heir,” Feng Luodi said confidently. She could find her answers from Situ’s slight expression but this was a conclusion that she formed herself.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span>That was not the answer that Feng Luodi wanted to get.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I always wanted to ask you. Why do you support the First Prince? I had learned to analysis the court situation from my father and know that he is currently the weakest of the princes. He is also the one that the Emperor likes the least.” Feng Luodi probed by changing the topic.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ looked at her. His eyes were shining. “What are the qualities that will help a prince get closer to the throne?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi examined his expression and thought for a while. She slowly said, “He is talented and can attain many political achievements as well as make the life of his people much better.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Continue,” Situ pulled the rein and Whirlwind turned around, casually walking forward.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Having a mother with a powerful background as well as the support of the officials.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Nothing else?”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was the start of Autumn. The cold wind blew gently and Situ pulled Feng Luodi closer to him. Feng Luodi thought about it again and remembered how happy the Eight Prince was today. She replied, “You need to get the Emperor to like you too. That is very important.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ smiled. “The First Prince has the talent and the Emperor will like him very soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi immediately continued, “The support of the officials are very important too but, he lacks a powerful background. Hence, he can only rely on the support of officials.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ stroked Feng Luodi’s hair. “Luodi, sometimes the support of prominent officials are more important than having a good background.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi noticed that Situ emphasised on the words ‘prominent officials’. She started thinking. </span><i><span>Situ is a very prominent and powerful official. Although he lived in Chang’an, he held the military power of the North Army. This is the best support for First Prince but it is dangerous for Situ. He has many military achievements and the Emperor has to guard against him for fear that he would have other thoughts or that he would support certain princes.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>Gan Qingjia is probably supporting the First Prince as well. He is standing in as the Imperial Treasurer currently, and would very likely become the official Imperial Treasurer soon. Also, he was brought up during the time when the Emperor wanted to undergo a reform of the court system. As the son of the Minister of the Left and the son-in-law of the Minister of the Right, all he needs is to perform well and he will rise to the position of a Minister within the next ten years. At the same time, he is also the owner of the Villa of Mount Baicha, meaning that he will not lack money any time soon.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>Xue Yiqi might also be supporting the First Prince but his current position was too low to decide the placement of the guards within Chang’an.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>All three of them had power but each had their own difficulty. There are many officials in the Xuan kingdom. Excluding those officials that refused to choose sides such as the Defender-in-chief and Censor-in-chief, many of them had already chosen their leader. It would be a dangerous journey for Situ.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Speaking of the First Prince, I’ve not had the chance to see him so far. This person who is a friend and master of Situ. What would he be like?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Situ opened his mouth after a moment of silence.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I said this to the First Prince before. We will help you get the throne and you must lead the people to a better future.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi heart stopped. She understood the weight of this sentence and slowly gave a gentle smile. </span></p>
 <p><span>“You will succeed.”</span></p>
