 <p><span>Chapter 101 Cloud Nine: Embarrassment</span></p>
 <p><span>"My greetings, Gentleman Yun and Master Zhou." Feng Luodi smiled as she curtsied in return.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>When was I ever so welcomed by the people of Chang'an? It was the complete opposite just one year ago, in the hall of Moonglade! Is it because of my relationship with elder brother?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Your musical talent has charmed everyone in the music scene; you should believe in your own ability." Jiang Moyin smiled, noticing the frown upon Feng Luodi's face. "The wine offered during the gathering isn't strong at all; you don't need to worry about that."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hey! Are you making fun of me?" Feng Luodi laughed a little, scanning the crowd that had gathered in the estate. Meanwhile, Gan Qingjia and Qi Jianqiu had quit their staring game and each found themselves a place by Linglong and Crystal respectively.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin smiled. "Now that they're gone, we can finally have a good chat. Let's just let the two of them stay there, shall we?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi smiled and nodded in agreement. </span><i><span>Those two just can't keep it down every time they meet, huh?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Beside them, Xue Yiqi raised his cup to his lips awkwardly. </span><i><span>Did I just get ignored by the two of them? Argh…if Situ was here today, I'd at least have someone to talk to. But then again, I'm only here to see…her. </span></i><span>His gaze landed on the girl dressed in red sitting beside Crystal, still engaged in an energetic banter with Gan Qingjia.</span></p>
 <p><span>Finally, the host of the gathering had arrived. Gentleman Fang was over sixty years old, but his age did not show in his step. His laughter was hearty and good-natured.</span></p>
 <p><span>"It is my pleasure to invite all of you maestros here today. We might not be familiar with each other yet, but we can take the opportunity to introduce ourselves later. This is how the gathering will go: drums will be played at the side, and a goblet will float along the stream as the beat is being played. The person in front of the goblet when the beat stops will finish the wine in the goblet and play a song for us." Gentleman Fang bowed, and the guests quickly returned his greeting.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just as the gathering was to begin, a shout came from outside the estate.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Let's welcome, the arrival of Princess Shangrong!"</span></p>
 <p><span>The crowd looked in the direction of the gates and sure enough, Princess Shangrong, the Emperor's favourite daughter, stepped into the estate. The crowd's reactions were mixed. The few admirers of the princess were undoubtedly delighted by her presence, but the maestros at the gathering frowned instead. </span><i><span>Princess Shangrong is indeed beautiful, but what does she know of music? It seems…weird that she is here today.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Chu Huaicai and Chu Xiaoxiao followed half-a-step behind the princess. They were surprised at the reception their arrival had gotten. </span><i><span>Why do most of these people look so unwelcoming?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"What is with this reception? Gentleman Fang, do you not welcome my presence?" Princess Shangrong could indeed hold her own at such public events, her words carrying an undeniable authority.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gentleman Fang was stunned for a second, but he quickly recovered and smiled. "My apologies for not anticipating your arrival, your Highness." The crowd bowed in accordance. "Our greetings, your Highness."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Mmmmm." Liu Shang waved her sleeve in the air and turned to Gentleman Fang. "Where is my seat?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Gentleman Fang smiled genially. "Where will you like to seat, your Highness?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang scanned the crowd, frowning when she did not see Situ at the gathering. She walked forward aimlessly and her gaze landed on Feng Luodi on the opposite side of the stream. She pointed to Gentleman Cen's seat across from Feng Luodi.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I want to sit here."</span></p>
 <p><span>Gentleman Cen's expression darkened for a split second, but he quickly recovered and got to his feet. "It is my honour, your Highness."</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Huaicai and Chu Xiaoxiao shot a look at Scholar Gao, who quickly stood up as well. "Please have my seat, Commandery Princess and Heir of Huaiyang."</span></p>
 <p><span>The three of them took the seat naturally, completely oblivious to the tension in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gentleman Fang smiled apologetically at the two maestros. "I'll find you a seat immediately."</span></p>
 <p><span>"No need for that, Gentleman Fang." Jiang Moyin called out to them across the stream. "You can join me at my table if you'll like." He got up from his table and moved to Feng Luodi's side instead, Xue Yiqi quickly following suit.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Thank you kindly, Grand Tutor Jiang." The two maestros bowed at Jiang Moyin.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gentleman Fang smiled and turned to face the guests. "Let the gathering begin!" The drummer in a corner of the estate started a beat against the drum.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qi Jianqiu grumbled under her breath. "How imprudent! Does she still think that she's in the palace? Gentleman Fang is a respectable scholar, one that even his Majesty respects. His gathering is not a place where someone like her can does as she pleases."</span></p>
 <p><span>Crystal smiled as she poured a cup of tea, whispering as she passed it to Qi Jianqiu. "Be careful of your words, Miss Qi. Some might make a mountain out of a molehill with them."</span></p>
 <p><span>Qi Jianqiu grinned as she sipped the tea. "Don't worry about that. Whoever wants to stir up such rumours can do as they want; I have no time for such people." Crystal smiled, knowing that her words are the truth. With a Minister as her father and her sister as a favourite of the Emperor, Qi Jianqiu was of a respectable status.</span></p>
 <p><span>Across the table, Chu Xiaoxiao whispered to Liu Shang. "You are really powerful, Shang'er! The guard at the entrance had tried to stop us from attending the gathering without an invitation but look what happened! They still had to welcome us with open arms at the end."</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang forced out a smile. She'd not intended to stay at the gathering upon seeing Situ's absence, but the sight of Feng Luodi changed her mind. </span><i><span>I have to embarrass her today! That is the only point this gathering holds for me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>The drum beats came to a halt and the goblet stopped in front of Gentleman Cen. He smiled and took the goblet from the attendant, downing it in one gulp. He ran his hands across the zither in front of him lovingly. "Let me play a song, </span><i><span>The Death of a Phoenix, </span></i><span>for all of us today."</span></p>
 <p><i><span>She turns to look at me as her footsteps fade</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>Our raft glides across the waters of Autumn</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>The light of the lantern sings a song</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>Begonias blush in the dark of the night</span></i></p>
 <p><span>The song ended and the crowd applauded heartily. Gentleman Fang sighed and smiled. "Gentleman Cen's music always has a melancholic tint to it; it brings me to tears every time I hear him play."</span></p>
 <p><span>The guests murmured their agreement, but a voice sounded out from the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Why does it sound like something played in those lowly zither parlours and whorehouses?" Chu Xiaoxiao snorted in disdain, unable to appreciate the fine parts of the music.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gentleman Cen's face froze. He had never visited a whorehouse in his life, and it was a disgrace to him for his music to be compared to something like that. Such a mockery from someone who obviously has no knowledge of music stirred an anger within him, but he could not retaliate in fear of Princess Shangrong beside her. Scholar Gao immediately felt his friend's rage and he patted his shoulder, trying to comfort him. He smiled at Gentleman Fang.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Please continue, sir. We'll all like to admire more beautiful pieces such as this."</span></p>
 <p><span>Gentleman Fang motioned for the drummer to continue, but his expression was dark.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi tugged on the sleeve of Jiang Moyin. "Why do they look like they're here to cause trouble? Something tells me that this gathering is not going to be a smooth one."</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin smiled. "You can retaliate all you want if you feel the need to do so - I'm sure many of the other guests are thinking the same. Don't worry; Gentleman Fang will definitely stand by your side if anything happens. He does have a certain say in front of the Emperor."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi pursed her lips and glared at him. "Don't make me out like I'm some troublemaker!" </span><i><span>Situ thinks the same of me as well! Wait…why am I thinking of him again?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>The gathering continued, the next few performances delightful and entertaining, each with a distinct flavour. The guests were enchanted by the music, the unpleasant experience caused by the princess and her friends almost forgotten. However, the princess was upset, seeing the attention of the crowd diverted onto the performers instead.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I've been sitting here for so long, yet I've not been asked to play a song. Yet, space is given to these people of unknown status to play the music instead."</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone froze, the atmosphere seemingly dropping a few degrees. Feng Luodi quietly whispered to Jiang Moyin. "I thought Princess Shangrong was good at everything, except for music?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"You're right indeed." Jiang Moyin chuckled. "Seems like she's finding trouble for herself instead."</span></p>
 <p><span>Gentleman Fang held in his anger. "It all depends on the goblet in the stream, your Highness. Who knows; you might be the next to play."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hmph!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Coincidentally, the next round saw the goblet stopping in front of Princess Shangrong. The princess took a sip from the goblet and frowned in disdain. "What horrible wine is this?"</span></p>
 <p><span>She continued. "I will not lower myself to play for the likes of you. The Heir of Huaiyang will play on my behalf instead."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi rolled her eyes. </span><i><span>How ignorant can she be?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Before Gentleman Fang could respond to her request, Chu Huaicai had set his hands on the strings. "It is my honour to play on behalf of Princess Shangrong. Now, if I may…"</span></p>
 <p><span>Without waiting for approval, he played a song on the zither. Compared to the maestros that had played before him, Chu Huaicai's music was…average at best. The crowd merely looked at him as the song ended, neither applauding nor complimenting him.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Why? Are you saying that the Heir did not play well?" Princess Shangrong looked upset by the turn of events. After all, Chu Huaicai was playing on her behalf. However, how was it possible for the music lovers at the gathering to praise such horrible music? An awkward silence ensued, some in the crowd visibly angry.</span></p>
 <p><span>A laughter broke the silence. "It's too much to ask for such music lovers to praise his skills, isn't it? After all, even someone like me who has no knowledge of music whatsoever, can't stand the horrible music played just then."</span></p>
 <p><span>It was Qi Jianqiu.</span></p>
