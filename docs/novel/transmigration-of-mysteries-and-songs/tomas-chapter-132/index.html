 <p><span>Chapter 132 Cascades: Let’s Never Meet Again</span></p>
 <p><span>The skies of Summer were unpredictable. A moment ago the sun was still shining brightly, but now, it was pouring. Situ sat in his study, reading reports. </span><i><span>The Imperial decree should have reached Feng residence now. What will Feng Luodi’s reaction be? </span></i><span>For the first time in his life, Situ felt nervous. He didn’t even feel this way when he first became a General and led an army for war.</span></p>
 <p><span>The head steward’s muffled voice suddenly came from outside the door. “General, Miss Feng is here. She is waiting for you in the courtyard in front of the antechamber. I have directed her into the house but she rejected my offer.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I understand. I will head over immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ sighed. He knew that Feng Luodi would find him to settle the issue, but he knew that he needed to be firm this time; it would be his last chance. Situ slowly walked to the antechamber. Feng Luodi was in a green dress, an umbrella in her hand. Everything looked so calm. Situ took his umbrella from the head steward and walked towards Feng Luodi.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The rain is getting heavy, let’s go inside the house.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Why did you ask for the decree?” Feng Luodi eyes were filled with anger as she glared at Situ, her voice cold. “Are you planning to force your desires upon me?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ looked into the eyes of Feng Luodi. “I just wanted you to understand my feelings and resolution.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I don’t want to know, there is no point in knowing it.” Feng Luodi didn’t budge.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ sighed. “That is why I had to resort to this: your attitude.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Everything I have said and done is true and heartfelt.” Feng Luodi slowly said, “If you still treat me as a friend, please ask the Emperor to take back his decree.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ was sombre. “Do you truly not want to marry me?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I have replied you many times and am not going to reply you again,” Feng Luodi continued to be unrelenting, “I am just the daughter of an official. I have no rights and power to ask the Emperor to take back his decree. However, you can.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Rejecting the Imperial Decree will bring ruin upon your clan.” Situ said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I know,” Feng Luodi looked at him pleadingly, “but if it is you, the Emperor might relent.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ shook his head. “The Emperor will not take back his words.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“How do you know if you don’t try?” Feng Luodi didn’t give up.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ’s temper flared. “I won’t try. I’d requested for the decree so that I can marry you; why would I want for it to be taken back?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi suddenly cast her umbrella to the side and dropped to her knees, the rain drenching her in an instant. Situ wanted to help her up, but he resisted the urge. If he became relented now, all his efforts would be in vain.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi’s voice sounded through the rain. “I, Feng Luodi, have only knelt before my ancestors and my parents. Excluding the Emperor, I have knelt before only one outsider, and that is you. Please! Ask the Emperor to take back his decree.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ's hand clenched and released. He replied, “Do what you like, I will not help you.” Situ turned around and walked into the antechamber. He threw his umbrella down and sat down expressionlessly, not speaking a word.</span></p>
 <p><span>The head steward stepped forward, wanting to hold an umbrella over her head, but was quickly stopped by her. She shouted, her voice hoarse. “If Situ Muye doesn’t agree to help me, I will kneel right here, until I die.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ immediately smashed the teacups on the table upon hearing her words. The head steward and the few members of the Covert Watched exchanged looks, but no one dared to say a word.</span></p>
 <p><span>The rain continued to pour. Feng Luodi knelt in the rain, her hair plastered to her face. She quickly turned pale, and her clothes were drenched, causing her to shiver in the cold. The attendants of the Duke residence all watched in surprise at this scene before being dismissed by the head steward.</span></p>
 <p><span>An hour had passed, and Duo could not take it anymore. He rushed into the antechamber and knelt before Situ. “General, I think we should let Miss Feng come inside the house first. She was sick in the Spring of this year, and I fear that her condition might worsen because of the rain, even taking her life.” Duo knew that it was apparent that he was exaggerating, but he had no choice. He needed to convince Situ.</span></p>
 <p><span>The frown on Situ’s face relaxed somewhat, but he quickly recovered and remained firm. “This is none of your business. You may leave, or you will be punished according to my military laws.” Situ closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>Duo wanted to say something but was dragged out by Quattor and Two.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Do you want to die? How can you interfere in this matter?” Quattor held back Duo who wanted to return to the antechamber. Two nodded his head in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span>Another hour passed. Feng Luodi seemed to be reaching her limits. The head steward could not bear to see her in such a state any longer and tried to persuade Situ. “Your Highness, we can always discuss the issue in a better way. If this continues, Miss Feng might not be able to take it. Why not agree to her first?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“If I agree to her now, this marriage will never happen.” Situ opened his eyes for a short while and said.</span></p>
 <p><span>The head steward walked out helplessly and tried to persuade Feng Luodi. However, Feng Luodi did not even budge. </span><i><span>This is the only method I can use to let Situ agree to my request. Even if he hates me, I can’t care about that anymore. </span></i></p>
 <p><span>The head steward sighed as he went back to the antechamber and helplessly signalled to the Covert Watch. Duo looked at Feng Luodi as her face turned paler. An idea came to mind and he quietly picked up a pebble in his palm. When no one was looking, he threw the stone in the direction of Feng Luodi and struck her.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Miss Feng has fainted!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ flew out the antechamber and carried Feng Luodi into the room. Before anyone could react, he shouted, “Call for the Imperial Physician!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Duo heaved a sigh of relief. Just as he thought he had concealed his actions well, Two patted his shoulder and said, “No one will talk about what you just did.” Duo smiled awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ gently carried Feng Luodi to the bed before realising that she was drenched from head to toe, and knew that she was going to catch a cold if her clothes stayed wet. Quickly, be called for a handmaiden who returned with warm water and a change of clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Your Highness, I am going to help Miss Feng change.” The handmaiden reminded timidly, not daring to look at Situ. Situ took one last look at Feng Luodi before walking out of the room. The rain was still pouring. Situ closed his eyes. He was still unable to be firm with Feng Luodi. The Imperial Physician arrived just as the handmaiden was done with Feng Luodi. He quickly stepped forward to diagnose Feng Luodi.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Please do not worry, your Highness. Miss Feng had just caught a small cold and will be able to heal completely after a few days of medication.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ nodded his head and asked for the head steward to send the physician off. He asked everyone to leave the room before turning to Feng Luodi. “You don’t need to act anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi opened her eyes and sat up. She rubbed her temples a while before looking at Situ.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Have you agreed?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ closed his eyes, trying to hide his sorrow. When he opened his eyes and look at Feng Luodi again, he couldn’t help but soften his heart. “I can never be firm with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was joyous upon hearing his words. “Does this means that you have agreed?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ did not answer her question. “Luodi, this is my last time asking you this question: are you really unwilling to marry me?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was in a daze, not daring to look at his eyes as she answered his question. “No. Please do not ask me anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ couldn’t hide his feelings any longer. He turned away, unable to look at her. “If that is the case, then let's never meet again. Love without an ending is one that should have ended a long time ago."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi suddenly raised her head and stared at Situ, but Situ had already shifted his gaze away. “I will take care of the Imperial Decree. Please take care of yourself from now on.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ took a few steps towards the door. He glanced at the cup of ginger tea on the table and said his parting words to her. “Remember to finish the ginger tea.” The door closed behind him, the room filled with a stifling silence.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi could not hold in her feelings any longer. Tears fell from her eyes to the patter of the rain outside the window as she curled herself up on the bed. She buried her face in her hands, sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Situ..." Her heartbreaking murmurs could barely be heard over the sound of the rain.</span><i><span>I do love you. I have feelings too and I felt your love. But how will I ever be able to tell you about my situation? How am I suppose to tell you about my true identity and that I will ultimately go back to the 21st Century?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Seeing their General leave the study, obviously heartbroken, Quattor complained to the rest. "Miss Feng is heartless! Our General her with such care and love, but she was unmoved."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Miss Feng has her own worries as well." Duo had spent the most time with Feng Luodi and knew her the best. He tugged at his hair. "But she doesn't tell anyone about what she's going through. I'm sure she has feelings for the General as well."</span></p>
 <p><span>“Whatever it is, it all ends today.” Two concluded dismissed the rest of his colleagues.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi regained her composure and left the residence. The rain had stopped when the head steward led her to the gate, but the ground was still wet.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Miss Feng, do you need someone to send you home?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi shook her head. “I can go back myself. Please return.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The head steward bowed and took his leave. Feng Luodi walked alone along the streets, and could not help but turn to look at the residence, her face filled with melancholy. </span><i><span>With this goodbye, there is nothing between us anymore. Now, we are mere strangers to each other. Situ has finally made his decision. It is what I've wanted, but yet it hurts so much.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>I want to go home.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>Perhaps, I may be able to forget about him when I go back.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>That same night, the Imperial Decree was returned to the desk of the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Oh? Why is this blank Imperial Decree not used by the Duke of Anping?" The Emperor was surprised upon seeing the return of the decree.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Yes, your Majesty." The Imperial Attendant relayed the report of the Attendant of Imperial Decrees.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I'm surprised to see the Duke go to such an extent for a woman. It's unexpected indeed." The Emperor smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I was surprised as well when I'd heard about it." The Imperial Attendant agreed. "But it's a pity for the marriage to be called off just like that. You do indeed place much trust in the Duke, your Majesty, for you to give him a blank Imperial Decree just like that. He could have done anything with it."</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor returned his attention to the reports on his table. "I do have much faith in him indeed. I know that he will not do anything bad with it. Put it back where it is."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Yes, your Majesty." The Imperial Attendant took the blank Imperial Decree from the table and saw the smile on the face of the Emperor, unnerving and vicious.</span></p>
