 <p>Chapter 169 Green Vines: Never Letting You Go</p> 
 <p>The last snow of the year was falling. The winds were getting warmer, but still the snow fell, as if it hasn't had enough time in the world. Looking down from the window on the second floor of the teahouse, one could see the piles of snow on the top of the pine tree by the entrance, but yet the pine tree stood tall and straight, welcoming the guests that approached. The mountains in the distance were bathed in amber dusk, looking as if they'd emerged from the fire, coated in the snow that glimmered with the radiance of moonlight. Plum trees in full blossom lined the roads that led into the hills, adding to the splendour of the winter. Amongst the snaking alleyways, the fragrance of plum blossoms wound its way around.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi stared out of the window for a while, but the one she waited for has not yet arrived. Her gaze shifted to the private courtyard built in the grounds of the teahouse instead. The pastel coloured leaves of the pear trees fall from their perches amongst the trees, unable to withstand the cold, and snow has gathered on the bamboo, weighing them down but never breaking. Feng Luodi was a little confused as to why Situ would send a message for her to meet at the teahouse.</p> 
 <p><em>Did something happen? Or is he merely trying to make this a romantic date?</em> Feng Luodi laughed. <em>No way that blockhead would understand anything about romance.</em></p> 
 <p><em>But I'll rather stay and wait instead of going back home to see Jianqiu and Miss Shanguan go at each other.</em></p> 
 <p>For some reason, on the day of their return, Feng Luodi had only just introduced Shangguan Yan to her mother when the married Qi Jianqiu rushed to the Feng residence. Right in Feng Luodi's cosy courtyard, the two beautiful women waged an invisible war with each other, unseen sparks flying through the air, and Feng Luodi was perplexed as to the cause of their animosity towards each other.</p> 
 <p>Despite her cleverness, she could not claim to understand that woman, much less guess that Shangguan Yan was viewing Qi Jianqiu as her love rival. Of course, Feng Luodi did not mention the past between Xue Yiqi and Qi Jianqiu to her, but Shangguan Yan was a resourceful woman, and quickly learned about Xue Yiqi's previous interest in the Beauty of Chang'an. Meanwhile, Qi Jianqiu's feelings were much simpler. She saw Luodi as her best friend, and her return with Shangguan Yan, a girl whose beauty rivalled her own, sparked the jealousy and protectiveness in her.</p> 
 <p>That was the reason behind each of their actions, but unfortunately, such was not known by the other party, and the two beautiful women continued their conversation in veiled animosity, often by directing their conversation onto other things. Jet and Scarlet did not dare to intervene at all, and their only hope, Feng Luodi, had already abandoned them to their plight as soon as she received word from the Covert Guard.</p> 
 <p><em>Are they gonna throw a hissy fit when they realise I'm not there anymore?</em> The image came to Feng Luodi's mind and she laughed lightly.</p> 
 <p>A gust of wind blew towards her, carrying the scent she was so familiar with, and the voice that was laced with exhaustion. "What are you thinking about that got you all smiley?"</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi heard the tiredness in his voice and turned around, only to find herself in a warm embrace. She rested her chin on his chest and raised her eyes to look at him, worry evident in her eyes. "What's wrong?"</p> 
 <p>Situ ran her hands through her hair and a sliver of a smile graced his lips. "Chang'an is going to be thrown into chaos, and so is the kingdom. Are you afraid?"</p> 
 <p>He'd just came from Gan Qingjia's place, and this was the first place he went after bidding goodbye to the First Prince, his heart laden with thoughts. On his way, he was informed by the Covert Guards that someone was watching Feng Luodi, someone even the Covert Guards could not locate. And that only meant one thing - that the Emperor had mobilised the Blood Shadow. He'd expected that to happen, but he never thought that the Emperor would be despicable enough to target the woman he loves. Has he found my weakness? Perhaps the plan has to be adjusted again, but what would we be left with afterwards?</p> 
 <p>The game of thrones in Chang'an was much different from the art of war in the battlefields. The latter required strategy, the former depended on schemes.</p> 
 <p>From Gan Qingjia, he knew that the court was already in disarray. The Emperor's attitude is still unclear, and that has influenced many in court. The position of the Defender-in-chief is still empty, the responsibilities currently managed by the Minister of the Left. The Minister of the Right has always been under the radar, pretending as if he is not intending to take sides, but Situ knew that he put his wager on the First Prince. That was a good sign, as long as the Emperor did not find out about it. The Grand Censor spend as many of his days as he could outside of the palace, his wish to be removed from the politics of the court clearly shown. Other than a few of the unimportant officials who recognise the First Prince for his talents, most of the officials of the court have their allegiances divided between the Eighth Prince and Eleventh Prince.</p> 
 <p>However, problems start to arise when the hearts of the officials are no longer set on their duties. The Emperor is growing old by the day, and his assignment of the Eighth Prince to oversee the running of the kingdom naturally came with much power. He had wished for the Eighth Prince to spearhead the agricultural and trade reforms in the kingdom, in a bid to revitalise the economy of the kingdom, but things did not go according to his wishes. The first thing the Eighth Prince did with his newfound power was to promote his followers, and then he abused his authority to oppress those who'd opposed him. Not only that, he'd threatened the Eleventh Prince more than once.</p> 
 <p>The Eleventh Prince grew up by the side of the Emperor, and is naturally one that is often doted upon. As a result, the Eleventh Prince became an arrogant man, his actions wild and unrestrained, and was no longer the cowardly boy he once was.</p> 
 <p>The events of the increasingly heated relationship between the eighth and eleventh princes further weakened the Emperor's body, and when he recovered from his bout of sickness, he found the power of the Eighth Prince already slightly out of control. Despite that, the Emperor was still the ruler of the kingdom, but his repeated attempts to curb the growth of the Eighth Prince has already garnered the prince's displeasure.</p> 
 <p>The tricky issue was the Eighth Prince's right to meddle in the decisions of the court, granted by his assignment to oversee the kingdom. The Emperor could not retract his assignment in time, and the Eighth Prince's misuse of it threw the entire court into chaos.</p> 
 <p>And with that, the kingdom was thrown into disarray as well. Though there were no major wars on the borders of the kingdom, minor conflicts happened many and frequent. That, coupled with the natural disasters that ravaged the lands and the lack of any effective relief policies, displeasure with the court amongst the people quickly rose. It would not take long for the dissent to simmer into anger.</p> 
 <p>In Situ's memories, this was the same situation the kingdom was in when he was but a young child. The internal problems of the kingdom were solved by the time he came of age, and the external threats were quickly quelled following his donning of the general's mantle. Only then, could the people of the Xuan kingdom live in peace.</p> 
 <p>But the peace only lasted that long, and now the kingdom was in chaos again. In short, it was a mere result of the neglect of those that had power; too engrossed in their tussle for more power, the prosperity of the kingdom was left forgotten. What they overlooked, was the fact that the kingdom could not afford such chaos any longer.</p> 
 <p>Situ's mouth curled upwards into a helpless smile as the thoughts ran through his head. <em>Even at such times, there are those who are trying to lodge complains against me: of having too much military in my hands and should be guarded against.</em></p> 
 <p>The situation in the North was not looking good, and he would have to return again with armour and suit in not more than three years. It was his realm, and he was needed there - but many in the court did not want him to be there.</p> 
 <p>The Emperor was suspicious of everything, and he had known it for a long time. The Situ clan had served as generals for generations, and any wrong move could result in the downfall of the clan at the hands of the Emperor himself - an opportunity he could not afford to give to the Emperor. He would do it at all costs, even if he had to bow down to the Emperor's unreasonable demands. The court was in chaos, and he worries most for the First Prince. The maniacal actions of the Eighth Prince have exposed too much of their plans, and any of them could backfire against them.</p> 
 <p>Many things required his urgent attention, but all he wanted was to see Feng Luodi. In court, he was a follower of the First Prince, but all of his heart belonged to the woman before him. He had tried so many ways to keep her by his side, but now it was a dangerous place to be.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi was surprised to not receive a reply from Situ. Spying the growing strands of facial hair growing out from his face, Feng Luodi slowly raised a hand in habit, reaching for the familiar object. Before her hands could touch Situ, she was pulled into that familiar and warm embrace again.</p> 
 <p>"Luodi. Please don't ever leave me."</p> 
 <p>His voice was not indifferent, nor cold, nor commanding, nor gentle, but pleading. His tone and his words instantly caused Feng Luodi to regret her actions.</p> 
 <p><em>I am no longer myself, ever since I'd met him. Will I be able to return back to my world after I've received Sonorous and Ringing Tunes? Can I really cut off all of these things that have happened here?</em></p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi did not know the answer. <em>Have I made a mistake?</em></p> 
 <p>Situ wrapped his arms tightly around her, his words carrying the weight of an oath. "I'll support whatever you want to do; just promise that you wouldn't leave me." The only thing he regretted about her, was to promise that he would respect her decision when she came to it; he would let her go if she saw desired.</p> 
 <p><em>How can I ever let go of her?</em></p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi's heart skipped a beat, and her frame shook. She quickly regained her composure, and placed her hands on Situ's arms, keeping silent.</p> 
 <p>Beyond the walls of the courtyard, the clouds were low and bathed in the light of dusk, and snow flew about wildly in the wind. The gentle dripping of the water from the edges of the roof carried the scent of the plum blossoms. A cold gust of wind blew through the drapes, and brought with them the slightly sweet air of winter.</p>
