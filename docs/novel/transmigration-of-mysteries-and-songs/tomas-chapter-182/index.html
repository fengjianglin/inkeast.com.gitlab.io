 <p>In the back garden of the Duke of Anping’s Residence, <a href="https://cdn.huaniaoy.cn/20160507/original/1462555740679.jpg@!picb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wax Plant flowers</a> shaped like little stars with specks of red in white were blooming vibrantly, its sight extremely intoxicating. There were also noble-looking pink and purple <a href="https://www.huabaike.com/uploads/allimg/sltimg/201806/5b2a1f5c5fe91.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moth Orchids</a> blooming elegantly with orange-yellow <a href="https://www.zhifure.com/upload/images/2018/5/9153346652.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dancing Doll Orchids</a> covering the earth like a gorgeous carpet. The enthralling <a href="https://www.huabaike.com/uploads/allimg/sltimg/201704/58f386b7acc86.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lily Magnolias</a> stood their ground against the wind independently, whereas closest to Luodi were clusters of elegant <a href="https://img0.pchouse.com.cn/pchouse/1111/01/142851_181.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hoary Stocks</a>.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, the sound of footsteps could be heard from behind. Feng Luodi faintly smiled and a few words escaped her vermilion lips. “Your residence seems to have collected all the orchids in the world.”</p> 
 <p>Situ was clad in majestic black robes with gold-plated ferocious-looking tiger ornaments on his shoulders. His aura was imposing, but it was the kind that made others respect him rather than fear him.</p> 
 <p>“My father likes orchids.”</p> 
 <p>His voice was steady as usual, seemingly like there was nothing in this world that could sway him.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi stood beside the Hoary Stocks and raised her head slightly to see Situ approaching her. With the sunlight shining on his back, he walked towards her with a radiance that seemingly illuminated the whole world. <em>This was the man she was deeply in love with.</em></p> 
 <p>“You also like orchids.”</p> 
 <p>Her words were filled with certainty and delight.</p> 
 <p>Situ would never forget his lover’s smile which resembled flowers in full bloom in the years to come. The elegant Hoary Stocks seemed to have lost their colours in her presence. The sunlight highlighted her ethereal appearance, making the scenery before him seem surreal. He felt as if he was in a dream.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go. Buhui is coming. Let’s go see him.”</p> 
 <p>Situ held out his hand to Feng Luodi. It didn’t matter whether it was when they first met, when they were on bad terms and quarrelling, when they were in an ambiguous relationship or when they were confiding in one another, Feng Luodi had never rejected the hand he reached out to her.</p> 
 <p>Only when he felt her tender hand in his did he feel that everything was real, that she was truly standing beside him.</p> 
 <p>“Is Buhui the former Northern Army’s Rear General?”</p> 
 <p>“Mhm.”</p> 
 <p>Situ nodded and explained, “To avoid arousing suspicion, I wasn’t able to meet up with him last time at the Dingtao Province. However, now that he was granted a new title, I’m afraid that he would have to stay in Chang’an from now on.”</p> 
 <p><em>Buhui was formerly one of the four high-ranking military officers of the Northern Army, then he was conferred as the General of the Central Army troops with two hundred thousand soldiers under his command. She should meet this person, who’d stuck by Situ through thick and thin all these years.</em></p> 
 <p>When the two of them arrived at the antechamber, the housekeeper was coincidentally leading someone dressed in martial attire towards them.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi sat down and carefully sized up Ji Buhui as he strutted in spiritedly with his head held high.</p> 
 <p>Ji Buhui didn’t have Zhang Xin’s imposing, unfettered and candid disposition nor Cheng Shifei’s ingenious, scholarly and refined temperament. He also didn’t look like the seemingly muddled but clear-headed Gao Ming. This Ji Buhui appeared steady and calm like Cheng Shifei, possessed the deportment of a great general like Zhang Xin and seemed as sharp and alert as Gao Ming. He was a general who seemed mediocre and ordinary, but he was, in fact, the most erudite of them all.</p> 
 <p>When Ji Buhui stepped into the antechamber, he smiled to show his respect to Situ, whom he hadn’t seen in ages, while sizing up Feng Luodi indiscernibly. Immediately after that, he knelt to Situ and sentimentally said, “General, I haven’t seen you in ages. Are you faring well?”</p> 
 <p>As he was speaking, he actually got a little teary-eyed.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi was stunned by this sight and hastily stood up.</p> 
 <p>Situ stood up as well and quickly walked forward to help Ji Buhui up. His expression was solemn, but his tone gentle as he responded, “As you can see, I have been well all along.”</p> 
 <p>Ji Buhui moderated his feelings before he turned towards Feng Luodi and nodded at her.</p> 
 <p>“Miss Feng.”</p> 
 <p>“General Ji.” Feng Luodi hastily returned the greeting. Ji Buhui then walked towards the seat opposite her.</p> 
 <p>After Ji Buhui sat down, he said to Situ in a deep voice, “General, it was indeed as you have expected. The Central Army’s new commander isn’t the Western Army’s Young General.”</p> 
 <p>Situ instantly sneered upon hearing this.</p> 
 <p>“Even if His Majesty is already ill beyond cure, he knows that he can’t possibly give more military power to the Xue Family. After all, the Xue Family may be the next Situ family, and he doesn’t have that much energy to deal with them.”</p> 
 <p>“But,” Ji Buhui was puzzled, he paused for a second before continuing, “But, when the covert guards sent the news to me, they said that His Majesty has already promised to follow your suggestion in court. If His Majesty goes back on his words, how could he face the officials and commoners?”</p> 
 <p>Situ shook his head, his expression icy-cold.</p> 
 <p>“He no longer cares about the views of the people in this world. He’s only concerned about one thing now.”</p> 
 <p><em>That is to get rid of him, Situ Muye.</em></p> 
 <p>This was something that Feng Luodi and Ji Buhui were aware of as well.</p> 
 <p>“In that case, General Ji,” Feng Luodi intentionally broke the heavy atmosphere in the antechamber and took the initiative to ask, “Who is the newly-appointed Central Army Commander?”</p> 
 <p>Ji Buhui flashed a gentle smile and replied, “It’s the Navy Commander from the Southeast Region.”</p> 
 <p>“Huh?”</p> 
 <p>Situ sneered again and added, “His Majesty really doesn’t care about anything anymore. A navy commander leading the Central Plains’ Central Army? I don’t know whether to laugh or cry.”</p> 
 <p>He then slightly furrowed and turned to Ji Buhui.</p> 
 <p>“Then, what groundless title did His Majesty give to you?”</p> 
 <p>It was like his ‘Duke of Anping’ title, simply to keep him in Chang’an.</p> 
 <p>“General of Fast Cavalry.”</p> 
 <p>Ji Buhui was a little unwilling to accept this title, but the Emperor was the supreme ruler, so he had no choice but to comply.</p> 
 <p>The atmosphere instantly became heavy again. After being at Situ’s side for so long, Feng Luodi faintly understood how a military general felt. It was the kind of indignance and feeling of not being able to complain despite having grievances, because he was feared by the Emperor due to his outstanding military achievements.</p> 
 <p>“Situ, could it be that General Ji can’t return to the deserts of the North anymore? The situation at the deserts of the North is certainly much more relaxed.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi’s thoughts were very simple. <em>His Majesty deliberately wanted to reclaim the military power in Ji Buhui’s hand as he was afraid that it would be used by Situ one day. In that case, if they were to hand over the military power, they were no longer a threat and could return to the deserts of the North. At any rate, the military power in the deserts of the North had already been secured, so the only difference was another general joining the family.</em></p> 
 <p>When Ji Buhui heard what she said, he showed a slightly bitter smile. After casting a glance at Situ, he spoke again, “Miss Feng may only know one part of it but not the other. I’m staying in Chang’an to intimidate the brothers in the deserts of the North and let them know that they’re not permitted to act recklessly.”</p> 
 <p>There was still something he didn’t say. <em>Situ stayed in Chang’an not only for the sake of reclaiming the military power in his hands, but also to threaten the Northern Army to not revolt.</em></p> 
 <p>After Ji Buhui was done speaking, he noticed traces of resentment surge forth from within Feng Luodi’s eyes. He instantly understood that this woman had understood the insinuation in his words. <em>As expected of the woman the General has set his eyes on.</em></p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi wasn’t aware of the fact that she had earned the recognition of one of Situ’s brothers. She turned to look at Situ with complex feelings. Heartache and discontentment tossed about in the recesses of her eyes, and her surge of emotions had changed her demeanour as a whole.</p> 
 <p>At this moment, the corner of Situ’s mouth raised slightly, making him appear somewhat cheerful. It was unclear as to whether he was pacifying Feng Luodi or Ji Buhui.</p> 
 <p>“Buhui, you returned at just the right time. I need you to handle some matters for me.”</p> 
 <p>Ji Buhui raised his head and coincidentally saw a cold glint flash past Situ’s eyes.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>The Eighth Prince returned to Chang’an right after Ji Buhui.</p> 
 <p>As soon as he’d returned, he instantly went to the Imperial Palace to beg the Emperor for his forgiveness. After admitting to his mistakes and apologising, he started to incite the Emperor again.</p> 
 <p>“Imperial Father, even though you don’t blame me, I’m truly ashamed of my past actions. Nevertheless, I’m determined to inform you of some folk songs that has been circulating in the deserts of the North.”</p> 
 <p>“Folk songs?”</p> 
 <p>The slightly dazed Emperor instantly sobered up upon hearing that. His abrupt action startled Palace Attendant Yu, who was watching from the sidelines.</p> 
 <p>“Folk songs are popular sentiments used to incite the commoners. You may speak, what folk songs are being circulated at the deserts of the North?”</p> 
 <p>The Emperor’s tone was filled with coldness, causing Palace Attendant Yu to shudder in fear.</p> 
 <p>The Eighth Prince shot a cautious glance at the Emperor and he seemed to have taken into account the Emperor’s health condition as he succinctly picked a few words to test the waters.</p> 
 <p>“For example, lyrics like ‘If one were to clad the imperial robe, one can become a ruler’.”</p> 
 <p>“‘If one were to clad the imperial robe, one can become a ruler’?”</p> 
 <p>The Emperor repeated this sentence expressionlessly. Suddenly, he reached out his hand and swept all the memorials on the desk to the ground.</p> 
 <p>The sound of objects falling everywhere was extremely piercing to the ear.</p> 
 <p>Upon seeing this, a complacent look flashed in the Eighth Prince’s eyes, which disappeared as quickly as it had appeared.</p> 
 <p>Following this, the words ‘If one were to clad the imperial robe, one can become a ruler’ spread throughout Chang’an.</p> 
 <p>“Concubine Hui told me that this was something the Eighth Prince had purposely told Imperial Father.”</p> 
 <p>The First Prince wore a worried expression as he said this, appearing extremely distressed.</p> 
 <p>When Gan Qingjia heard these words, he felt apprehensive. This was the first time they had heard such words. What was worse was that, there was only the Emperor, the Eighth Prince and Palace Attendant Yu in the Imperial Study at that time.</p> 
 <p>All the veterans in the palace had unknowingly become inclined to the First Prince. Hence, as long as Situ didn’t fall, the First Prince would definitely become the future emperor of the Xuan Kingdom.</p> 
 <p>When he thought about how outstanding the First Prince was when they first met and compared it to how increasingly unfathomable he was acting nowadays, Gan Qingjia hastily lowered his head, concealing the emotions in the recesses of his eyes.</p> 
 <p>Situ simply waved his hand, appearing calm and composed.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness doesn’t need to worry. Even if the Eighth Prince deliberately put a spoke in our wheel, His Majesty won’t change his mind. This is something that will happen sooner or later.”</p> 
 <p>The indiscernible smile tugged at the First Prince’s lips froze for a second. Immediately after that, he stroked the teacup lightly as he said, “It looks like Situ has long made preparations.”</p> 
 <p>Situ nodded lightly.</p> 
 <p>“By all means, Your Highness may rest assured. Regardless of what happens, Your Highness will be able to achieve your great undertaking.”</p> 
 <p>For the First Prince, his words were like a tranquillizer, but at the same time, they were also the source of uneasiness brewing in his heart.</p> 
 <p><em>What preparations did Situ make exactly? To think that he could still say something like this despite being threatened by Imperial Father, the Eighth Prince and the Eleventh Prince.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Imperial Father has the intention of letting the Eleventh Prince become the next emperor while the Eighth Prince was eyeing the throne covetously, so no matter how he looked at it, he himself wasn’t sure that he would become the final victor.</em></p> 
 <p>Doubts continued to sprout in the First Prince’s heart, but he quickly changed the topic and said, “It’s been a while since I last saw Yiqi. He sure is having it easy as the Imperial Army Commander.”</p> 
 <p>Gan Qingjia smiled as he followed along and added, “A few days ago, Old General Xue sent a letter to Yiqi. Following that, he immediately applied for leave and left Chang’an.”</p> 
 <p>“Could it be that something had happened to Old General Xue?”</p> 
 <p>The First Prince furrowed slightly as he questioned. <em>As long as Old General Xue was around, his Imperial Father wouldn’t appoint a new Grand Marshal but if something were to happen to Old General Xue, then the future would become very unpredictable.</em></p> 
 <p>After Gan Qingjia heard those words, a trace of displeasure flickered across his eyes, but he still replied, “Old General is extremely healthy. I surmise it’s some private matters.”</p> 
 <p>“Oh.”</p> 
 <p>The First Prince nodded and seemed to be pondering something.</p> 
 <p>Gan Qingjia took the opportunity to glance at solemn-looking Situ, who kept silent all the while, and a feeling of unease suddenly engulfed his heart.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>At the morning court assembly, the next day.</p> 
 <p>It seemed as if many officials had come to an agreement beforehand; they were totally in sync as they impeached the Duke of Anping, Situ Muye, one after another, just like how they did a few months ago.</p> 
 <p>For example, they talked about how Situ had abused the Emperor’s imperial favour and relied on his high rank to wantonly bully other officials with lower ranks. Most importantly, although the Eighth Prince hadn’t managed to find out the faults of the other generals during his stay at the deserts of the North, everyone linked the recent rumours to Situ.</p> 
 <p>Once the group of officials were done with their speech, they waited for the Emperor’s judgment. After all, the Emperor was the one who’d prompted them to speak their mind.</p> 
 <p>After all was said and done, an official boldly requested, “I earnestly request for Your Majesty to remove Duke of Anping’s noble title and reclaim the power he held over the Northern Army.”</p>
