 <p>Chapter 133 Burnt Ends: Assassination</p>
 <p>Ever since Qi Jianqiu had had her meeting with Xue Yiqi, she was no longer burdened with the guilt and spent her days roaming the streets of Chang'an with Gan Qingjia. Everyone could see from their intimacy that the two were very close. Now, Gan Qingjia was the one to be given the first taste of her culinary innovations. For some unknown reason, the two Ministers of the Kingdom, the fathers of Gan Qingjia and QI Jianqiu, had both closed an eye to the relationship between the two, letting the two of them go about their relationship on their own.</p>
 <p>However, contrasted to the delightful situation between the two of them, Situ spent his days in misery, either drowning his sorrows in wine in his residence or training his troops in the field. He scrapped all his meetings and rejected all gatherings with his brothers. The only thing that seemed bright in his life was the return of the First Prince to the capital. But even that, had more to be desired. The First Prince had left Chang'an for almost eight years, and he had no supporters in court. Moreover, it was just as Situ had feared: the Emperor had no love for the First Prince, and it was painfully obvious in how he treated the prince without any enthusiasm. Although the First Prince is the eldest son of the royal family, there were no resources for him to rely on in court, for Empress Zhaoren was of low birth and did not leave him any resources. His future was bleak at best.</p>
 <p>The First Prince, Liu Ran, was undeterred by his lack of power and spent his days visiting officials of the court, seeking to know more about the development of the kingdom, having been ousted from politics for so long. Many officials had shut the door in his face, but some had guided him along the way. Despite this, he had no results to show for himself, and the Emperor took no notice of him.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the struggle between the Heir and the Eighth Prince continued. The Heir's worst fears had come true: the emergence of a prince that could rival his influence in court. His rival had used to be the Seventh Prince, but now his brother the Eighth Prince had taken over his role. Now, seeing the Eighth Prince as his biggest obstacle to the throne, the Heir had repeatedly tried to suppress his growth in power and that had gained the ire of the Emperor, but his scolding was to no avail.</p>
 <p>The Emperor was disappointed in the Heir, but he did not treat the Heir differently. A such, things continued calmly in court, but only on the surface. It was in this situation that Situ requested to be allowed to return to the North to check on the situation.</p>
 <p>"I've read all the reports that came in from the North carefully, and there seems to be nothing out of the ordinary. Why are you requesting to go to the North, my Duke?" The Emperor looked at Situ with a raised eyebrow, suspicion well concealed in his gaze. The Emperor was sixty-one of age, but his health was in good condition.</p>
 <p>"I am afraid that I might get used to the luxuries of Chang'an and forget how to lead my troops in battle, your Majesty." Situ was calm. "A soldier has to train often to bring glory for the kingdom on the battlefield."</p>
 <p>"Are you finally willing to claim the lands of the other kingdoms for me?" The Emperor was suddenly excited. He longed to invade the surrounding kingdoms to bring fame to his name, but the previous wars of the Xuan kingdom had left the people weak and in need of rest. Moreover, the only general that could achieve such results for him is Situ Muye, who was unwilling to do so.</p>
 <p>Situ smiled apologetically. "I do not have such intentions, your Majesty. The Xuan kingdom is not suitable for expansion at the moment, and…"</p>
 <p>He was cut off by the disappointed Emperor with a wave of his arm. "Say no more. I understand what you mean." The Emperor paused for a moment. "You may tour the North, but you have only three months to train your troops before your return to Chang'an. Return swiftly as soon as you are done."</p>
 <p>Situ frowned, hearing the hidden meaning behind his words. He'd wanted to explain himself but quickly stopped, not wanting to worsen the situation of the First Prince.</p>
 <p>"Yes, your Majesty. I will return as soon as I am done."</p>
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
 <p>Naturally, the First Prince was surprised at Situ's decision to tour the lands in the North. "If even you are gone, I will have no one else to rely on in court." The First Prince sighed. His meetings with Situ were clandestine, for fear of garnering the suspicions of the Emperor due to the power held in the hands of Situ.</p>
 <p>"Do not worry, your Highness." Situ comforted the First Prince, who was his friend as well. "Qingjia had not been in court for long, but his position in stable and he has garnered the affection of the Emperor. He will be of assistance to you. Yiqi is in the Imperial Army, and I believe that he will be the Chief of the Imperial Army in the future; he will be of great use soon."</p>
 <p>"It's too early to talk about that." The First Prince smiled. "I'm sighing at our parting. We have been separated for so long, and it's only been a while since we've been reunited."</p>
 <p>Situ poured a goblet of wine for the First Prince. "It'll only be three months at most. When my heart is at rest, I will be back to aid you in your career, your Highness."</p>
 <p>The two of them toasted to each other.</p>
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
 <p>It wasn't long before the time came for Situ and his subordinates to leave, along with a thousand soldiers They gathered outside the walls of Chang'an, an officer making the preparations.</p>
 <p>"General. Everyone is here and we can leave."</p>
 <p>Situ turned his gaze away from the city gates and nodded.</p>
 <p>The officer roared. "Onwards!"</p>
 <p>The army quickly departed from the capital.</p>
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
 <p>In the Feng residence.</p>
 <p>Qi Jianqiu hesitated. "Luodi, are you really not going to send him off?" As her relationship with Gan Qingjia progressed, she finally recognised the weird relationship between Feng Luodi and Situ. But by then, it was already too late; things were already over between the two of them. Both Qi Jianqiu and Gan Qingjia were discussing plans to bring the two back together again, but Situ had suddenly left for the North.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi leafed through her musical scores as if she did not hear Qi Jianqiu's question.</p>
 <p>Qi Jianqiu continued. "Qingjia told me that Situ's request to tour the North has garnered the suspicions of the Emperor. Come to think of it, that is only natural. Situ has many achievements and holds much power in his hands. In the past, he'd only been to the North on orders of the Emperor, and it's only natural for the Emperor to be guarded against him seeing as how he's requesting to go to the North this time round."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi ignored the topic at hand. "Has Gan Qingjia formerly proposed to you yet? When are the two of you getting married?"</p>
 <p>"Hey! We're talking about the two of you right now." Qi Jianqiu was confused by Feng Luodi's attitude.</p>
 <p>Finally, Feng Luodi set her musical scores aside and looked Qi Jianqiu in her eye. "It is impossible between the two of us. I thank you for your good intentions, but I'm happy as long as the two of you are happy. If you still see me as a friend, please do not talk about such things again."</p>
 <p>Qi Jianqiu was sombre. <em>If Luodi could say such strict words to me, she must've said even harsher things to Situ. I used to be upset at Situ for stealing Luodi from me, but now I pity him. </em></p>
 <p>"Alright, I wouldn't talk about it anymore." Qi Jianqiu finally agreed. "I'll bestow my kindness upon you and tell you about the things between Qingjia and me."</p>
 <p>She continued. "Even if wants to propose to me, he has to go through my father. He's been hard at work trying to convince his father to propose on his behalf; it'll be easier to convince my father that way."</p>
 <p>"It's such a pain to ask for your hand in marriage, Young Miss Qi. He has to convince his father at home, impress your father in court, and fend off the retribution of the Heir and the Eighth Prince for stealing you from them."</p>
 <p>Qi Jianqiu blushed. "Alright, alright. I'll tell good things to my father about him to help him out then."</p>
 <p>The two chatted for a while more and Qi Jianqiu stood to leave. Though it seemed otherwise, she'd been hard at work finding supporters for the marriage, someone who is powerful enough to convince their parents. In such a world, there can be no freedom of love without power. She is the daughter of an important official, and her marriage is not up to her at all. Suffice to say, not even her father, the Minister of the Right, can decide her marriage completely. She can be sacrificed at any moment by the Emperor to secure his throne if things ever come down to that. Luckily, her sister, Concubine Yao, is of great help to her.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi's face fell as Qi Jianqiu left, overwhelmed with melancholy. <em>Situ is trying to hide from me and forget about me, such that he may start again anew. That was what I'd hoped and I should be feeling relieved about it. But why does my heart hurt so badly? </em></p>
 <p>"We'll never meet again." Feng Luodi murmured. Or so she thought.</p>
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
 <p>It was only ten days after Situ left for the North before she received news that shocked her core: the General of the North was assassinated on his way to the North and is gravely injured. He is in a coma and on the way back to Chang'an for treatment.</p>
 <p>The tray in Feng Luodi's hands slipped through her fingers and clashed onto the floor. "What did you just say?" She looked frantically at Qi Jianqiu.</p>
 <p>Qi Jianqiu had rushed to the Feng household as soon as she'd heard about the news. Feng Luodi looked as if she'd lost a part of a soul, and it pained her to see her friend like that. She quickly comforted her. "The men from the Duke's residence are sending him back to Chang'an. Although the reports say that he's in a comatose state ever since being struck by a stray arrow, how is that possible?"</p>
 <p>She continued. "He's the General of the North, the hero of the people! It's impossible for him to be so gravely injured! I'm sure the reports have been exaggerated."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi's breath caught in her throat. "Jianqiu, when is he coming back?"</p>
 <p>Qi Jianqiu glanced at her. "They should be back in three days."</p>
 <p>"When he is back, can you check on him for me?" Feng Luodi looked pleadingly at Qi Jianqiu.</p>
 <p>"Of course." Qi Jianqiu did not hesitate at all. "But are you not going yourself?"</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi bowed her head, murmuring to herself. "What right do I have to go?"</p>
