 <p><span>Chapter 105 Cloud Nine: "Di" That Rests With the Wind [1. A type of plant. ]</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was greeted with the sight of her anxious parents the moment she entered the antechamber of the Feng household.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Mother!" Feng Luodi could not hold it in anymore; she dashed into the open arms of her mother and bawled.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Luodi." The First Lady held Feng Luodi lovingly in her embrace and patted her head. "My poor girl; how did something like that happen to you?"</span></p>
 <p><span>The Chamberlain was equally anxious. "How did it go? Was the decree made official?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi shook her head, her voice thick with emotion. "No, it wasn't. I rejected the proposal on the grounds of fulfilling my filial duties for my grandmother."</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Lady heaved a sigh of relief. "Thank god you were witty enough to think of such an excuse back there. Otherwise, you'd have to be married off to a person I've never even heard about!"</span></p>
 <p><span>The Chamberlain had other worries. "How did you even attract the attention of his Majesty? I worry that the matter wouldn't be resolved so easily, even after one year. The Second Lady is about to have a child; we can't afford to have anything happen to the household right now!"</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Lady shot the Chamberlain a stern look and turned back to comforting Feng Luodi. "You did well today, Luodi. Even if his Majesty refuses to let the issue rest after a year, that is a year longer to think of a solution."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Yes, Mother." Feng Luodi slowly got to her feet, holding onto her mother for support. She wiped away the tears at the corners of her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Chamberlain came up with an idea. "Why don't we look for a potential suitor for Luodi right now? They can get married once the year is up and the Emperor wouldn't be able to do anything about it then."</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Lady shook her head but before she could voice her disagreement, Feng Luodi rejected the idea vehemently. "Father, I do not wish to marry anytime soon. Our household had never needed for political marriages, and I hope the same goes for mine. Although my marriage does indeed lie in your hands, I'm sure you love me enough to let me find my true love myself, don't you?" &nbsp;She needed a promise from her parents. The promise would be effective until she could return to her own world. Then she can stop worrying about the problem of marriage and focus solely on finding the 10 Guqin.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Of course, Luodi. The path is yours to walk." The First Lady held her hand reassuringly. Feng Luodi nodded and turned her reddened eyes to the Chamberlain.</span></p>
 <p><span>"What do you say, Father?"</span></p>
 <p><span>The Chamberlain narrowed his eyes. "Are you still thinking about the Duke of Anping?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi shook her head. "I'm not. I remember my promises to you, and I intend to stand by them."</span></p>
 <p><span>The Chamberlain fell silent for a while. Feeling the glares from the First Lady beside him, he finally relented. "You can decide for yourself. I just hope you that you don't ruin yourself with your stubbornness."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Thankyou, Father." Feng Luodi bowed deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Chamberlain nodded, his mind a flurry of thoughts. He was a loyal man, and loyalty meant his allegiance to the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>It had been a few days since the incident, and Feng Luodi had not stepped out of the household. Cloud Nine had yet to be repaired: the strings that made up a crucial part of the Guqin's sound were broken, their materials rare and specific. Manpower had already been sent into the mountains to look for a replacement, but they had yet to return.</span></p>
 <p><span>Looking at Feng Luodi in the middle of the courtyard, her fingers idly strumming notes on the zither before her, Jet could barely mask her concern. The only thing Feng Luodi had done was to send Fei on some unknown task, but Feng Luodi had been looking rather different as of late. </span><i><span>Young miss looks…scary. </span></i><span>Suddenly, Scarlet came dashing into the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Young miss, Master Jiang sends an invitation for you to meet him at Manchun Tang. He already has a dining room booked for you."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Elder brother?" Feng Luodi raised her head slowly, but her eyes were still lifeless and empty. She shook her head. "Scarlet, send an attendant to elder brother and tell him that I am not feeling well enough for a meeting today."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Young miss! Why didn't you say that you're sick today? I'll fetch the physician immediately." Jet turned to leave the courtyard, her footsteps hurried and panicking.</span></p>
 <p><span>Scarlet sighed. "Jet, can't you hear that it's just an excuse? There's no need for the physician."</span></p>
 <p><span>Jet scratched her head in confusion, backing away from the entrance of the courtyard. </span><i><span>What is wrong with young miss recently? She would never have rejected an invitation from Master Jiang in the past!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Scarlet leaned closer to Feng Luodi. "Young miss, you haven't left the household in a while - what a waste of the perfect weather! You'll never know, you might feel better once you get out there!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was unmoved.</span></p>
 <p><span>Scarlet continued. "The First Lady has been worried sick about you these few days, young miss. She'd wanted to come over a few times, but the other handmaidens advised her to give you some space."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi finally looked at Scarlet. She slowly stood up and walked towards the entrance of the courtyard. "I'll go myself. Both of you can stay here."</span></p>
 <p><span>"But-" Scarlet and Jet exchanged looks.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi did not so much as look back at time. "Let me have sometime alone."</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi stepped into the dining room, her eyes meeting the worried gaze of Jiang Moyin. </span><i><span>Another person who's worried about me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Elder brother." Feng Luodi called out softly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin stood up and helped Feng Luodi into her seat, his voice laced with concern. "You look really pale, Luodi. Are you alright? Why didn't you let any of your handmaidens follow you today?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"No worries, elder brother. I know what I'm doing." Feng Luodi looked at the table of sumptuous delicacies, feeling no appetite at all.</span></p>
 <p><span>"This is really worrying, Luodi. Let me send for a physician." Jiang Moyin got to his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span>"No need for that, elder brother." Feng Luodi held him back. "I'm fine, really. I guess I just need more rest."</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin narrowed his eyes and sat back in his seat. It was a while before he spoke up again. "Is it because of what happened in the Imperial Study that day?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was unsurprised that Jiang Moyin knew what happened. "Seems like you already know about it, elder brother."</span></p>
 <p><span>"I do." Jiang Moyin sighed. "What are you going to do now? The delay of one year is but futile; if the princess harbours any ill intention towards you, your only option would be to take action as quickly as possible."</span></p>
 <p><span>"What do you say to destroying the reputation of Princess Shangrong?" Feng Luodi's voice was steady, her expression calm.</span></p>
 <p><span>Surprise showed on Jiang Moyin's face though he quickly hid it.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi caught the look of aghast on his face and her lips turned upwards in cruel self-mockery. "What's wrong, elder brother? Do you find me cruel? Or do you find me too weak to handle this myself?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin knew that his expression had hurt Feng Luodi deeply and he struggled to correct himself. "Neither of them. I'm just worried that this will be bad for the Feng household. The princess is royalty, and the Emperor is definitely on her side. If you do anything underhandedly, the Emperor will not let things slide so easily."</span></p>
 <p><span>"I know that." Feng Luodi regained her stoic composure. "I'm just saying. Do you have any ideas for me?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin looked at Feng Luodi</span><i><span>. Luodi looks so…foreign. Is this who she truly is</span></i><span>? He smiled, avoiding the topic. "I remember something Qingjia once said, about describing girls with different wines."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi raised an eyebrow and filled their cups with wine. "Elder brother, are you allowed to drink wine?" </span></p>
 <p><span>"Of course; this is just some light sake." Jiang Moyin smiled as he continued. "So I was thinking: which of the many wines could you be?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Which one am I?" Feng Luodi put the goblet to her lips and took a sip. </span><i><span>Too bland.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Sake." Jiang Moyin spoke slowly. "You're like sake, seemingly bland and tasteless, but enchanting and sweet after the initial tinge. If warmed, sake becomes fiery, blazing a path to the heart of things. What do you say of my description?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi smiled slightly. "You flatter me too much, elder brother." She downed the wine in one gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span>"You're too humble, Luodi." Jiang Moyin finished the wine in his goblet as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I have to say, elder brother, the way you try to change the topic is a little clumsy. That is not befitting of your position as the Grand Tutor." Feng Luodi filled their goblets again, pushing a plate of snacks to Jiang Moyin, motioning for him to have some before his next cup of wine.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin looked at Feng Luodi, his expression serious. "Luodi, it'll be extremely easy for you to find yourself a husband with your talents and personality. The best solution now is to find a husband to marry once the year is up."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi's expression did not change. "I'm not surprised that yous aid the same thing as my father, elder brother."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Seems like it's not an acceptable solution to you then." Jiang Moyin's fist tightened. </span><i><span>I can't stand up for her at all! I can't speak to his Majesty about this, and neither can I do anything to Princess Shangrong because of my allegiance to the Heir! I can't tell her how I feel about her, and neither can I protect her from harm. Why am I so useless?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Elder brother." Feng Luodi set her goblet on the table and looked him in the eye. "You are just like Father. You will never understand why I refuse to marry."</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Is it because of Situ? </span></i><span>The words almost escaped his mouth but he held it back at the last moment. Of course, he knew of Feng Luodi's rejection of Situ in the Imperial Study as well.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Am I supposed to be happy? After all, Luodi has rejected Situ outright. But why do I feel even more uneasy? Her unwavering resolve in this matter…it feels as if she's ready to cut everyone out of her life.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi looked at Jiang Moyin across the table silently. </span><i><span>Some things can never be said. They can only be buried with the soil on the grave of Feng Luodi.</span></i></p>
