<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>At this moment, Feng Luodi thought: <em>Feelings are truly something unfathomable.</em></p> 
 <p>Once, her main goal was to return to the 21st century. However, along the way, she unknowingly went astray. When she deviated from her course by an excessive margin, she promptly pulled onto the reins to make herself turn back.</p> 
 <p>The thought of staying in this world had flashed across her mind before. She had been grumbling because she was caught up in a dilemma due to that man, and grumbling why the Heavens was treating her like this. She also often complained and questioned why this mission required her to spend so much time and effort, causing her to form a bond with so many people in this world such that their existence have been engraved into her bone marrow. No matter where she went, there was no way for her to shake them off her mind.</p> 
 <p>However, one day, when she found out that Situ was caught in a dilemma even worse than hers, she suddenly felt that things were no longer difficult for her. She would either return home, go back to Situ’s side or meet her demise. It was actually not hard for her to choose from these matters at all. The feelings that overflowed in her heart completely ignited all her fighting spirit and obliterated all her desires. There was only one thought that remained. <em>That person must stay safe and sound.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Hence, no matter whether if she were to return home, stay in this world or meet her demise…it didn’t matter which choice it was in the end as long as that person was safe and sound.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Then, what choice did she have to make?</em> Feng Luodi looked up, hoping to see the sky through the small window.</p> 
 <p>It was late in the night, but she couldn’t see anything at all.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Duke of Anping’s Residence.</p> 
 <p>“Situ, are you really going to do this?”</p> 
 <p>The First Prince had always been gentle and casual like a modest gentleman, but at this moment, anxiety was written all over his face. He was staring at Situ with a complicated and profound look in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Once you do this, you can’t turn back anymore. We can still think of other methods. You don’t have to make such a rash decision.”</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness.”</p> 
 <p>Situ was enshrouded in the shadows, his expression dark and unfathomable.</p> 
 <p>“Tomorrow is the execution day, yet there’s lax security around the court prison. Isn’t this clearly arranged so that I can break into that place to save Luodi? His Majesty must be very restless now, afraid that I won’t break in and afraid that after I do that, I still have a last card up my sleeves.”</p> 
 <p>“Then, do you have a last card up your sleeves?” The First Prince finally asked in a deep voice.</p> 
 <p>This was the matter he had been fretting about every day. <em>As soon as Situ collapsed, who would support him? Would his Imperial Father truly support him?</em></p> 
 <p>The First Prince sneered in his heart. <em>He was afraid that his Imperial Father wasn’t the one with a suspicious nature. Without a surefire plan, he wouldn’t trust anyone easily.</em></p> 
 <p>“What does Your Highness think?”</p> 
 <p>Situ’s voice was chilly and ruthless. As he was sitting in the shadows, the First Prince was unable to see his expression clearly.</p> 
 <p>“Situ, if the one talking to you now isn’t your friend but your monarch, what would you choose?”</p> 
 <p>The First Prince ultimately still asked this one question. <em>He believed that all the officials who support him would support this decision of his. He was adept at observing the overall situation, carefully scheming in the dark, without letting any loophole slip. He only reached the current state after preparing for many years.</em></p> 
 <p><em>An honest person who only knew how to consider the welfare of the commoners wouldn’t be able to become an emperor because that person would definitely be sent to prison before he ascends the throne. Only if he were to ascend to that position would he have the qualifications to talk about how to rule a country and how to let the commoners live a prosperous and happy life, right?</em></p> 
 <p><em>It was true that he was sincere towards the commoners and he truly wanted to become a monarch whose reputation would last throughout the ages. His seemingly contradictory thoughts were, in fact, not contradictory at all.</em></p> 
 <p><em>In this world, to accomplish something, there must be sacrifices. It just depended on whether the sacrifices are worth it or not. Situ would no longer have a kryptonite if that woman was sacrificed.</em></p> 
 <p><em>As for what kind of person Situ would turn into afterwards, that is a concern left for the future.</em></p> 
 <p><em>That’s because time would heal almost all wounds. Time was a good medicine but also a poison. It just depended on how one would use it.</em></p> 
 <p>“This depends on Your Highness and not me.” Situ’s voice was like a storm in the deep sea, seemingly tranquil but surging in all directions.</p> 
 <p>“I just need to tell Your Highness what I’m willing to do. I don’t plan to consider other matters.”</p> 
 <p>A cold glint flickered across the First Prince’s eyes. Immediately after that, a calm smile emerged on his face, as if his intense interrogation and the vicious aura he’d emanated earlier was just an illusion. But Two could see it clearly from his hiding spot, and a wave of cold disappointment washed over him.</p> 
 <p>“Since you have already made up your mind, I have no choice but to support your decision. However, from now on, your path and mine are destined to be extremely arduous. I hope that you’re ready for this. As long as Imperial Father is around, you’ll be hunted down with a death warrant any moment. When the time comes, I hope that you will take care of yourself.”</p> 
 <p>When the First Prince said this, it sounded sincere. However, the covert guards in the dark found his words rather ironic.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, I’ve already made ample preparations for my future and yours.”</p> 
 <p>“What?”</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing this, the First Prince lifted his head slightly. With a raised eyebrow and puzzled look on his face, he watched Situ walk out from the shadows.</p> 
 <p>“The time I leave Chang’an tomorrow will be the time Your Highness ascends the throne.”</p> 
 <p>It seemed as if Situ wasn’t aware of the severity of his words. When he saw the increasingly surprised look in the First Prince’s eyes, the corner of his mouth curled slightly upwards.</p> 
 <p>“When His Majesty intercepts me outside the court prison, it will be when the Imperial Army and the Imperial Guards control Chang’an and the Imperial Palace. At the same time, the respective commandery princes would command soldiers five kilometres away from the Wei River and you will become the new emperor of the Xuan Kingdom.”</p> 
 <p>“I can understand the part you said about the Imperial Army and the Imperial Guards, but what’s with the commandery princes?”</p> 
 <p>The First Prince’s current expression was one without any traces of pretense. He had always felt that Situ was omnipotent and also knew that Situ appeared to be low-profile while, in fact, he was maneuvering many things in the dark. <em>To think that he had secretly contacted all the commandery princes.</em> A bold and shocking move like this was something that had never crossed the First Prince’s mind before this.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness doesn’t need to know and shouldn’t know any more than this. It’s alright as long as no one uses this matter to denounce Your Highness in the future.”</p> 
 <p>Situ had seemingly seen through the First Prince’s thoughts, but at the same time, it seemed like he didn’t.</p> 
 <p>“The General of Fast Cavalry will be responsible for deploying and contacting the commandery princes. Your Highness doesn’t need to worry about this. As for the token for the deployment, it is in Chamberlain Feng’s hands. After Luodi and I leave, may I be so bold as to ask Your Highness pardon these people.”</p> 
 <p>At this moment, the First Prince’s feelings were in turmoil. <em>The current Situ was so unfamiliar to him that it made him panic-stricken. He had never expected that the throne was this close before. He had also never thought that there would be a day where Situ would threaten him. Moreover, Situ wanted him to guarantee that he wouldn’t touch his brothers nor the family and friends of his beloved woman once he’d left the court and the Xuan Kingdom.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Such thought-out measures and deep affection…</em> The First Prince felt that the good friend he’d grown up with seemed so distant and foreign all of a sudden.</p> 
 <p><em>The people remained the same, yet everyone has changed.</em></p> 
 <p>“I understand, Duke of Anping.”</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Time vaguely turned back to more than ten years ago.</p> 
 <p>There were a young precocious and isolated Imperial Prince and a young General born from an aristocratic family shouldering great responsibility.</p> 
 <p>They met on a frigid winter day when flowers scattered down in the plum garden and became close friends.</p> 
 <p>Everything had suddenly changed one day.</p> 
 <p>The young General was valiantly fighting on the battlefield in the deserts of the North while every step ahead was difficult for the Imperial Prince.</p> 
 <p>When the young General was triumphant and gained recognition for his achievements, the Imperial Prince forced to leave Chang’an instead.</p> 
 <p>The successful young General passed his days with precaution and every step he took was filled with danger. The Imperial Prince, on the other hand, seemed downtrodden but he was secretly planning ahead at every step of the way.</p> 
 <p>They met again amidst the winds of change and noticed that the two of them had changed despite things remaining the same.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>On the same night, Chamberlain Feng sat in his Study with the <a href="http://www.yidulive.com//upload/image/20181122/1542874286830754_1074_600_600.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jade Token</a> in hand, turning it left and right as he stared at it. With only the faint glow of the moon illuminating the room filled with bamboo slips, the atmosphere in there appeared extremely dismal.</p> 
 <p>Soon after, the sound of knocking could be heard. When he opened the door, he saw the Commandery Prince of Yu Zhang standing outside.</p> 
 <p>“Father-in-law.”</p> 
 <p>Chamberlain Feng bowed deferentially and invited him in.</p> 
 <p>After the Commandery Prince of Yu Zhang settled in his seat, he glanced at the Jade Token in Chamberlain Feng’s hand and sighed.</p> 
 <p>“I have led a military life all those years and now that I’m old, I’m guarding the border at Yu Zhang. I never expected that there would come a day where I would be resisting the Emperor I’d personally assisted to ascend the throne back then.”</p> 
 <p>“Father-in-law’s words are exactly my thoughts.”</p> 
 <p>Chamberlain Feng’s expression was also complicated.</p> 
 <p>“However, this would all have to depend on His Majesty’s choice. Originally, I should’ve taken the general picture into consideration and not conduct like this. But, when I saw Duke of Anping’s resolve, I also thought that blood is thicker than water. What harm is there in trying?”</p> 
 <p>The Commandery Prince of Yu Zhang revealed a smile and stroked his grizzled beard.</p> 
 <p>“That day, when Duke of Anping personally came to Yu Zhang to see me, doubt had brewed in my heart. It was just that I didn’t expect that he would actually think so far ahead. He had already anticipated today’s turn of event a year ago. Otherwise, he would definitely be at His Majesty’s mercy and everyone else would be cruelly oppressed while Luodi would be sacrificed in vain. By all means, you can go ahead and do it. He has already prepared everything. Nothing will happen to Yu Shan and nothing will happen to the people in the Feng Residence.”</p> 
 <p>“Since Father-in-law also agrees with the plan,” Chamberlain Feng grasped the Jade Token in his hand, his voice serious and firm as he continued, “I will definitely accomplish the task at hand at all costs.”</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Gan Residence.</p> 
 <p>“Jianqiu, it’s already late in the night. You should rest early.”</p> 
 <p>Gan Qingjia was extremely vexed as he looked at Qi Jianqiu. She was sitting in front of the table, her face filled with worry. It was as if he had expected. <em>Once Jianqiu found out about the matter, she would definitely overtax her nerves and put a strain on her health. This wouldn’t be beneficial to Qianjiu nor the child in her womb. But, he couldn’t find a single word to stop her. He understood her temperament the best. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have had to put in so much effort to win her hand in marriage.</em></p> 
 <p>“Qingjia, I’m not resigned to this.” After a long moment of silence, Qi Jianqiu only uttered this one sentence.</p> 
 <p>Gan Qingjia didn’t respond and waited in silence. He knew that Qi Jianqiu merely wanted to vent her frustrations a little at this moment.</p> 
 <p>“It was me who purposely approached Luodi and she didn’t even blame me when she found out the truth. It was me who always bothered her, but she never got annoyed of me. I wanted to open a shop so she came up with an idea. I wanted to run a restaurant so she helped me come up with a plan. Whatever I wanted to do, she fully supported me. But now that she’s in trouble and needs help, I can’t do anything for her at all.”</p> 
 <p>“Last time, when she was incarcerated, I sought Father for help but I was rejected. The reason for that was because I couldn’t read the overall situation. However, it was then that I made a firm resolution and vowed that I’ll definitely not let her suffer from harm nor imprisonment ever again.”</p> 
 <p>“I wasn’t able to fulfil that vow. I thought that after she got together with Situ, Situ would have this ability to protect her, but the truth isn’t as sanguine as I have imagined. I’m an idealist and utterly useless.”</p> 
 <p>“Jianqiu, you’re not to blame for this.” When Gan Qingjia said this, his voice was already hoarse.</p> 
 <p>“Everyone’s destiny can’t be predicted. Perhaps, if Feng Luodi hadn’t met Situ, she wouldn’t have suffered all these. However, in that case, she wouldn’t be the Feng Luodi you know. We should all believe in Situ. He won’t give up on Feng Luodi.”</p> 
 <p>Qi Jianqiu still appeared worried. Her gloomy appearance was faintly visible under the candlelight.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Jiang Residence.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master, are you really going to do this?”</p> 
 <p>Lu Bo’s expression was one of worry and despair.</p> 
 <p>“This is the only way, there’s no going back.”</p>
