 <p><span>Chapter 138 Burnt Ends: Conspiration</span></p>
 <p><span>As Situ expected, the Eighth Prince didn’t place much importance on his assassination. From the prince’s point of view, Situ was loyal to the Emperor and was not under his wing. Hence, it would be better if his position was given to someone who supported him. However, the Eighth Prince changed his mind that day when one of his men brought him some news.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I have investigated the area where the Duke was assassinated,” the leader of the investigation said, “all aspects of the assassination, whether is it the venue of ambush, the timing of the assassination, are done in an orderly and professional manner. Also, this was done by someone from the Xuan kingdom and has nothing to do with other countries.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Eighth Prince frowned and placed his hand on his chin, “I have looked at the corpses that were provided by the Duke. At first, I thought that they were just assassins hired by someone. However, they displayed greater loyalty to their master and chose to commit suicide in order to not leave any evidence behind. It seems then that my thinking was wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span>His subordinate agreed. “They have to be either assassins or</span><i><span> sishi</span></i><span>. However, many officials of high rank have</span><i><span> sishi</span></i><span> under them. If we investigate in this direction, it might take a long time to get any result.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“But for someone to train so many </span><i><span>sishi</span></i><span>, the person must be someone in a higher position,” the Eighth Prince eyes lit up, “he or she has to be someone from the royal family and it has to be someone who holds many secrets, someone like my elder brother. Before he left Chang’an, he has a huge number of </span><i><span>sishi</span></i><span> under him.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The subordinate knew that the Eighth Prince was referring to the Seventh Prince. Both of them were born to the same mother and the Seventh Prince was indeed powerful before he went downhill. </span></p>
 <p><span>“It seems like I have to treat this issue seriously from now on.” The Eighth Prince smiled mysteriously. </span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>The next day in court, the Eighth Prince was preparing to report his findings when a piece of urgent news came from the plains of the North.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Your Majesty, the General of the Left of the North Army was just met with assassination. Fortunately, the assassins had failed and the Assistant General is fine. Two of the corpses are now on their way to Chang’an.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor was shocked, “Who has the guts to do this? Is it by outsiders?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The soldier shook his head. “I have checked the corpse of the assassins. They are the people of the Xuan kingdom, carrying on their bodies the same symbol as the same assassins who’d tried to assassinate General Situ. I believed that the mastermind behind these two attacks is the same person.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Minister of the Right immediately added in. “Your Majesty, General Situ will be arriving this afternoon.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor frowned. His gaze became dangerous as he said to the Eighth Prince sternly, “Have you not found out the mastermind behind the assassination of the Duke of Anping? Now, the General of the Left of the North Army has also met with the same attack. Are you waiting for me to get assassinated as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Eighth Prince dropped to his knees in fear, “Please contain your anger, Father. I have already found some evidence and will be able to catch the culprit soon. I believe General Situ will understand the situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor’s gaze swept over the officials as he said angrily, “Anyone who dares to hurt my generals is also my enemy. If anyone of you has any evidence, do share it with the Eighth Prince. With everyone’s help, the case can be closed sooner.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The officials bowed and agreed immediately. </span></p>
 <p><span>However, the Heir suddenly came forward and said, “Father, now that the General of the Left of the North Army is assassinated, he must be in shocked and will not be able to handle the affairs of the army well. We should appoint another official to be the General-in-lieu and help with the affairs of the army.” </span></p>
 <p><span>The Eighth Prince’s gaze landed on the Heir and smiled. Now he knew where to start his investigation. His brother was too impatient. </span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor got even more furious and scolded, “Is this is the time to say such things? I’ve asked for you to supervise the country and just look at what you have done! Nothing you did lived up to my expectations. Although the First Prince had just returned to Chang’an, he has already managed to help me with many things. You have been the Heir for so long, what have you done?” </span></p>
 <p><span>The Heir’s face turned white as he glanced towards the First Prince. His eyes turned vicious.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I know my mistakes. I will learn from the various officials and improve,” the Heir softened his tone. </span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing that the Emperor was still angry, the old Chief Xue walked forward and smiled. “Please do not worry your Majesty. The princes just wanted to help you. If you are not pleased, just reprimand them. There is no need to be angry.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor looked at Chief Xue and his expression relaxed. He sat down and asked Chief Xue, “it is rare that you took the initiative to speak in Court. Do you have something to say?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“You still understand me the best,” Chief Xue took a step forward, “my son, Yiqi, had a good relationship with the Duke of Anping. When he knew that the Duke was still in a coma, he was so worried and wanted to ask for your approval to investigate the case alongside the Eighth Prince. However, his rank is too low to be in Court. Hence, I would like to help my son to get an approval from you. I hope you will understand, your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor recalled, “I remember that child; I’d just raised his position last month. He has potential but is too young and needs more training. If he is as capable as his brother, I can send him to the Army of the West.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Chief bowed. “You are right, your Majesty, my son definitely needs more training. It is his honour to be recognised by you and to serve you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor laughed out loud and the solemn atmosphere immediately dissipated. “I agree to his proposal. Ask your son to report to the Eighth Prince residence and investigate the case together with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Let me thank you on behalf of my son,” the Chief bowed to the Emperor and turned to bow to the Eighth Prince. </span></p>
 <p><span>The Eighth Prince smiled and nodded his head. The Chief had served two Emperors. Doing him a favour would be beneficial to him.</span></p>
 <p><span>When the Court dispersed, Gan Qingjia rushed out of the palace but was held back by the Chief. “You are meeting Yiqi later right? Please help me convey the news to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I will definitely bring the news to him,” Gan QIngjia nodded immediately. </span></p>
 <p><span>He wiped his forehead as the Chief turned to leave. The Chief was indeed powerful. He had purposely told Yiqi to leave his house quietly without being found out by anyone and yet, the Chief knew about it. </span></p>
 <p><span>The thought of meeting Xue Yiqi later caused Gan Qingjia to sigh. He remembered his sad face that day when Xue Yiqi spoke to him, “Third Brother, you are together with Qi Jianqiu now right?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I should have noticed Jianqiu’s feelings towards you,” Xue Yiqi was blaming himself, “as long as you treat her well, I will not disturb your relationship.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Sigh,” Gan Qingjia touched his face. </span><i><span>His little brother is too honest.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Meanwhile, the Heir started venting his anger the minute he returned to his residence, hurling pieces of expensive furniture across the room. Yu Ming could tell that the Emperor had once again rejected the Heir. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Your Highness, let’s put aside the issue of North Army first and focus on regaining the Emperor’s heart.” Yuming suggested cautiously.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Heir waved his hands and sat down. “You don’t understand. This is the best time for me to do anything. I must let my men go into the North Army. Only then will I really hold the military power.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Yu Ming couldn’t help and ask, “Why are you so desperate to get hold of military power? Your actions will cause the Emperor to be suspicious of you. This will place you in a bad position.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Heir gave a sinister smile. “It will be useful.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Yu Ming felt a chill ran down his spine and looked away from the Heir.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia left the palace and went straight to the agreed meeting place. He immediately saw Xue Yiqi. He looked a bit tired but still wore a smile on his face. Gan Qingjia sighed and went forward. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Yiqi.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Third Brother,” Xue Yiqi called. He acted naturally and asked, “why do we have to sneak into Second Brother’s residence?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Let’s walk and talk,” Gan Qingjia came closer and patted Xue Yiqi’s shoulder with his fan. The two of them headed towards the Jiang residence. </span></p>
 <p><span>Fu Bo was just ordering people around when he noticed someone sneaking into the residence.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Somebody he… help?” the head steward realised that he actually recognised the people who sneaked in and stopped in his tracks. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Master Gan, Master Xue, why did the two of you climb the walls of the residence? The front door is open.” Fu Bo was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span>“We are working out our body,” Gan Qingjia raised his eyebrows and walked to Jiang Moyin’s room. Seeing this, Fu Bo immediately ordered the servants to keep silent and not spread any gossip before running to catch up with them.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Have you come to talk to Master Jiang?” the head steward asked, “he is still in deep sleep after the worsening of his illness yesterday.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I know,” Gan Qingjia nodded, “Moyin’s health is deteriorating too quickly. This is not natural at all. There must be some other reasons. We have come to find the reason today and may need your help later Lu Bo.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The head steward was stunned for a second and became serious. “Are you saying that...someone wants to harm Master Jiang?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“That is just our speculation,” Gan Qingjia squinted his eyes and looked around Jiang Moyin’s room. Xue Yiqi went ahead and started searching through the room. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Lu Bo, could you bring me to the places where Moyin likes to go?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The head steward nodded and brought Gan Qingjia to the study and the pavilion. After walking one round, they went back to Jiang Moyin’s room. </span></p>
 <p><span>“This is strange.” Gan Qingjia touched his chin. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“What’s wrong?” The head steward questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I’ve asked a few physicians and they told me that although Moyin’s illness might be associated with his weak body, there is a higher probability that he has been in contact with a slow-acting poison.” Gan Qingjia explained as he continued scanning the room. “Let’s go find Yiqi. Maybe he found something.”</span></p>
 <p><span>When they entered Jiang Moyin’s room, they saw Yiqi staring at a pot of flower. Jiang Moyin was lying in bed covered with a thick blanket. The noise that they made didn’t wake him up. </span></p>
 <p><span>Sorrow flashed in Gan Qingjia’s eyes as he rushed to Xue Yiqi’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Is there anything wrong with this flower?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hmm?” Xue Yiqi continued to stare at the flower. “I just feel that the flower is weird but I couldn’t quite put my finger to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The head steward came over and said, “This is Master’s favourite flower. It has been here for the past few years. Master always water the flower whenever he has time.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Xue Yiqi nodded his head and turned around to look at Jiang Moyin. “I have inspected the other items in this room. There is nothing out of place. What about you?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Nothing.” Gan Qingjia shook his head and scrutinised the pot of flower. He suddenly touched the soil with his fan and his face changed. He grabbed the pot and immediately took it out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span>Xue Yiqi and the head steward followed closely behind.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Is there really something wrong with this flower?” Xue Yiqi asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia had found a piece of wood and was poking the soil with it. A strange smell instantly filled the air. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Do not breathe in the smell!” Gan Qingjia shouted and quickly put the chunk of soil back in place. He turned to the head steward. “Please call over the physician in the residence.”</span></p>
