 <p><span>Chapter 104 Cloud Nine: Unwilling</span></p>
 <p><span>"The Duke of Anping? What is he doing here?" The Emperor was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span>Princess Shangrong cut in quickly, afraid that Situ would foil her plans. "Father, let the Duke wait outside until we settle this matter at hand. The taking of a concubine for the Heir of Huaiyang is a very important matter."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Nonsense." The Emperor shook his head. "I'm sure the Duke has important matters to report to me; how can I let him wait?" He motioned to the attendant.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Enter, Duke of Anping!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi took a look at Princess Shangrong. </span><i><span>Why is the princess looking so…antsy all of a sudden? Could it be that she's doing this to me because of Situ?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Situ marched into the Imperial Study and bowed to the Emperor. "My humblest greetings, your Majesty."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Rise." The Emperor returned to his seat and turned to face Situ. "What is this urgent matter that you wish to report to me?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ glanced at Feng Luodi, who was still kneeling on the floor. He swept up the loincloth around his knees and dropped to his knees beside her. "Your Majesty, I am here today to request for decree from you, to bequeath the daughter of Chamberlain Feng, Feng Luodi, as my wife."</span></p>
 <p><span>His words stunned the entire study.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor shook a hand at Princess Shangrong, who was about to speak. He smiled at Situ. "What bad timing, my Duke. The Heir of Huaiyang had just asked for her hand in marriage before you came. I'm afraid I might have to disappoint you in this matter, seeing as how he'd come to me before you did."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ was unmoved. "If you remember, your Majesty, I'd once mentioned about a girl that I'd wished to wed. She is Miss Feng, the girl beside me right now. I'd proposed to her when we were in the North, but it was delayed because I had to seek the approval of her parents before it could be completed. If you look at it that way, I came before the Heir of Huaiyang."</span></p>
 <p><span>Princess Shangrong shoved Chu Huaicai on the arm, hard. Chu Huaicai quickly stepped forward and knelt in front of the Emperor as well. "Your Majesty! Please believe my genuine intention to wed Miss Feng and bequeath her to me!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi's hand was shivering, not with fear, but from anger. </span><i><span>Who are these people to decide my marriage for me? </span></i><span>"Your Majesty, I will not marry either one of them. I wish to stay by Mother's side and keep her company, at least for the next few years." It took all she had to keep her voice steady.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Well, well. One of you here is trying to go against my decree, while the other two ask for my decree in marriage. This is frustrating indeed." His words seemed playful, but anger was apparent on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ kowtowed, an action he was pardoned from because of his importance to the kingdom. "Your Majesty, I'd remained single these twenty-seven years of my life, waiting for my chosen lover. Now that I've met her, please give me her hand in marriage. I swear to abide by my position and lay my life down for the kingdom, and for you."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi's head was still on the floor, but her entire body shivered uncontrollably with rage. </span><i><span>So this is the age where everything is decided by the whims of a single man. With just one word, he can destroy my entire life. Why is it so hard for me to simply keep my family and I safe?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Situ looked at Feng Luodi, trying to hold in the urge to help her up from the ground. His kowtow surprised the Emperor, finally realising the seriousness behind his words. Quickly sensing her Father's urge to give in, Princess Shangrong dropped to her knees as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Father, I have long since admired the Duke of Anping. Please give us your blessings to be together in marriage."</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Huaicai was shocked to hear those words. He looked at Princess Shangrong, who quickly waved a hand at him, trying to placate him. Chu Huaicai took a deep breath and steadied himself. </span><i><span>I'm sure the princess is just doing this to stop the situation from becoming worse.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Now Feng Luodi finally understood the motive behind the princess's animosity towards her. </span><i><span>It was indeed because of Situ! What a ruthless woman, going to such lengths just for a man.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Princess Shangrong's actions were unladylike, to say the least, acknowledging her desire in public for a man who evidently did not harbour the same feelings towards her. He frowned. Before he could reprimand her, Situ spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your Majesty, I will not wed anyone but Feng Luodi in my life. Not even if it's the Fifth Princess."</span></p>
 <p><span>His attitude irked the Emperor, but the Emperor took it out on Feng Luodi instead. "Feng Luodi, the choice is yours. Do not give me the excuse of staying by your Mother's side again; you'll have to choose between one of them today. Chamberlain Feng is a smart person; I believe you are as well."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ's head shot up, his eyes staring hard at the Emperor. A chill ran down the spine of the Emperor, but he continued to pressure Feng Luodi. Princess Shangrong smiled, knowing that things were going according to her plan. Feng Luodi could only choose Chu Huaicai, or it would mean going against the princess right in front of the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi wanted to scoff. </span><i><span>I am a smart person? He isn't letting me choose, but digging a grave for me and asking me to lower myself into it. </span></i><span>She took a deep breath and raised her head, looking straight at the Emperor. "Your Majesty, I will marry neither of them. Please listen to what I have to say."</span></p>
 <p><span>"My grandfather is the Commandery Prince of Yuzhang. My grandmother had just passed away before the new year and, according to the customs of our household and that of cultural traditions, I am barred from marrying within the next one year. I am unable to accept this marriage, because of such rules."</span></p>
 <p><span>Princess Shangrong quickly cut in, unable to let her chance slip away so easily. "We are here for your engagement today; you can choose to marry the Heir of Huaiyang next year. How dare you defy the Emperor's royal decree yet again! Your entire clan should be executed for your disrespect!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi looked back at the princess, refusing to back down. "Even if I was to choose someone to marry, how is your Highness so certain that I will choose to marry the Heir of Huaiyang?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"How dare you!" Princess Shangrong raged.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I know not why your Highness is so bent on making things difficult for me today, but the actions of your Highness is not exactly befitting of your status as a member of the royal family. I humbly advice for you to be more careful of your actions in the future, your Highness."</span></p>
 <p><span>"You treacherous little-!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Enough, Shang'er." The Emperor's voice was cold and hard. Princess Shangrong did not dare go against her father and quickly quietened down.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi turned back to the Emperor and kowtowed again. "I've heard that your Majesty was rather close to my grandfather back in those days. I'm sure your Majesty remembers the strict family rules in our family and the same rules that are enforced in the Yuzhang province. If I myself do not abide by the rules of the family as a descendant of the Commandery Prince, it'll taint the reputation of my grandfather. Your Majesty, please retract this decree that you've yet to issue officially and let me fulfil my filial duties to my mother and grandmother."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ looked at Feng Luodi, a torrent of emotions in his eyes. </span><i><span>Why is she so unwilling to marry me? Does she have no faith in me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor thought about it for a moment and looked at the four of them on the floor before him. "Rise."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Feng Luodi, I will let your case rest today. You have to remember your words and carry out your filial duties for the next one year. As for the proposal of the Duke of Anping and the Heir of Huaiyang, we can talk about that when the one year is up. It's too early for that now."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Father!" Princess Shangrong cried. She did not want to let Feng Luodi off so easily. </span><i><span>One year is too long! If I don't settle this issue now, Situ will continue to be infatuated over this vixen and I will be married off to someone else instead of Situ! I cannot let that happen!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"My decision is final. Return to your palace, Shang'er." The Emperor's voice was flat, devoid of any emotion.</span></p>
 <p><span>As the favourite daughter of the Emperor, Princess Shangrong knew that her case was lost. She bowed. "Rest early, Father. I will take my leave."</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor nodded and turned to Feng Luodi and Situ. "The two of you may leave as well. Do not bring such personal matters before me again."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Yes, your Majesty."</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor turned to Chu Huaicai. "Stay back for a while longer. There're some things I have to talk to you about regarding your inheritance of the title."</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>The street outside the gates of the palace was quiet and lonely, with barely anyone about. Feng Luodi walked in front, Situ following a few steps behind. Whirlwind followed behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ broke the silence.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Luodi. Why are you refusing to marry me?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi stopped in her tracks and spun around, her face devoid of emotions. "I never knew you as someone who would force things upon me!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ held in his exasperation. "That was the best plan I could come up with at the moment to help you, but it was also my truest feelings. Would you rather marry that Chu Huaicai who is obviously harbouring ulterior motives?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"No, I will not marry him." Feng Luodi's voice was steely. "I have many reasons prepared to convince the Emperor to retract his decree, and if worst came to worst, I'd rather dash my head against the pillar than agreeing to that marriage. I will choose death over such an arrangement. The situation would not have changed, even if you hadn't appeared."</span></p>
 <p><span>"What if I request for your hand in marriage like how the Heir of Huaiyang had done? Will you still choose death over me?" </span><i><span>Please, I know you're not so cold-hearted.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Will you?" Feng Luodi stared deep into his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ sighed. </span><i><span>How am I supposed to reply to that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>It was a long time before Feng Luodi spoke again. "Let Quattor return to you; I do not need him by my side. This is my second time saying it; the third time will be ugly." She turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ could not hold it in any longer. He dashed forward and grabbed her on the shoulder, forcing her to turn back.</span></p>
 <p><span>All he saw was the tears in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>He swallowed his words of anger. A finger gently wiped her tears away. "Just leave these to me - I'll handle any problems you have. All you have to do is play your zithers, or travel if you want. All I ask for is for you to stop pushing me away."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi slapped his hand away, hard. "Situ, who gave you the right to decide for me? My power may be insignificant to you, but I have the right and ability to decide for myself. Do not treat me as a seventeen-year-old girl that needs your protection. That is not me."</span></p>
 <p><span>That is Feng Luodi. Not Luo Di.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Luodi."</span></p>
 <p><span>Ignoring Situ's call, Feng Luodi strode away from him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ's face darkened, seeing Feng Luodi's figure retreat into the distance. "Two."</span></p>
 <p><span>Covert Guard Two appeared before him, head bowed in obedience. "General. What may I do for you?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Send someone to Huaiyang. I want to know how such a useless and cowardly man became the Heir of Huaiyang. Is the Commandery Prince blind?" Situ's expression was cold. </span><i><span>How dare he touch Luodi? He is the reason for Luodi's anger at me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Yes, General. I will get to it immediately." Two turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Wait," Situ called out, "it's time for Qingjia to do his job; the situation has changed. Send word to him."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Yes, General."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Quattor, that's enough for now."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Yes, General." Quattor's voice echoed from the woods by the side of the road.</span></p>
