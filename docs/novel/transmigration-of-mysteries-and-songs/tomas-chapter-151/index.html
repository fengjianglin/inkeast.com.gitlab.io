 <p><span>Chapter 151 Burnt Ends: Memories</span></p>
 <p><span>The days of Autumn are often filled with rain. Compared to the thunderstorms of Summer that often leave a cooling sensation in the air, the long drizzles of Autumn are like the quiet sobs of a woman, carrying with them a freezing sadness in its starts and stops. This day, the clouds above Chang'an were overcast like usual, as if they were going to fall from the sky at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span>Along the road from the Office of Imperial Clan Affairs to the Imperial Prison, a lone man walked with an umbrella above his head. Dressed in a robe of bamboo green, with star-shaped embroidery along the collar and edges of the robe, the man had a cape of fox-skin wrapped around his neck despite it already being the middle of Autumn. The pendant of white jade that swung with his every step reflected the pale shade of his skin, his delicate eyebrows and handsome features making him the very definition of a handsome gentleman.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin held back a cough as he handed a badge to the guards before the Imperial Prison. The guards exchanged a look and one quickly disappeared into the building, returning with the Imperial Jailor. Following the jailor, Jiang Moyin slowly descended into the depths of the Imperial Prison, where the criminals were held.</span></p>
 <p><span>The prison was damp and dark, with barely any sunlight reaching the dank floor that stank of mould. Jiang Moyin coughed heavily, but still, he followed the jailor to the deepest part of the prison. The jailor stopped outside a cell and turned to Jiang Moyin, without looking at the inmate inside.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Master Jiang, he is inside. His Majesty has ordered that nobody is to go into the cell; you can only talk to him through the bars."</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin nodded. The jailor bowed and quickly turned to leave. Jiang Moyin dropped to one knee outside of the door and peered into the cell. A frail-looking man with dishevelled hair sat inside, a stark contrast to his handsome image of the past.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your Highness!"</span></p>
 <p><span>The tired eyes of the Second Prince quickly found Jiang Moyin sitting mere feet away from him. Joy welled up in his eyes, but it was quickly replaced by anger. His mouth twitched furiously, but no words came out of it. He sighed heavily.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I never thought that you'd be the one to visit me now."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your Highness." Jiang Moyin called out again, sadness apparent in his eyes. He forced a sad smile and placed a porcelain bottle on the floor of the cell through the bars.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Second Prince did not even look at the bottle. "What is there to say between the two of us now? It's all over. Everything is over. I'm no longer the Heir that you'd once pledged yourself to, and you are no longer my Grand Tutor. Why do you have to come and witness me in this horrible state?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your Highness." Jiang Moyin repeated the words again. In the game of thrones, the losers can never be forgiven. No one can break that rule.</span></p>
 <p><span>Nostalgia welled up in the eyes of the Second Prince. His voice was a low mumble when he spoke again, like the light patter of the raindrops outside the prison. "In the years I've spent in the palace, I've always remembered how you looked when your father had brought you into the palace when you were only three. Back then, I was but the least favoured son out of all the princes. When I learnt that you were the famous child that had astounded the entire Chang'an with your intelligence at three years of age, all I wanted was to be your friend."</span></p>
 <p><span>"I did all I could back then. We finally became friends, and I pestered you day and night to teach me all that you knew. When you were thirteen, I begged Father and Mother to make you my study-partner, but I never expected you, who was already famous throughout the kingdom, to agree."</span></p>
 <p><span>"From thirteen to nineteen, you helped me all that you could for six years. From an unknown prince, I slowly grew into the inheritor of the kingdom, the powerful Heir Apparent. We shared our visions of the kingdom all those years, and I remember all your promises of helping me make our kingdom the way we saw it."</span></p>
 <p><span>"For production, to reduce taxes on the farmers and allow them to recuperate from the years of war. For education, to place emphasis on the system of examination and the importance of education for all. For politics, to accept opinions and criticisms while trusting those that I know. I remember every word of yours, even till today."</span></p>
 <p><span>The voice of the Second Prince rose. "I'd thought that you would stay by my side all the way, until the day our dreams were realised! But now, one wrong step led to many and I am now in the abyss."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your Highness!" Jiang Moyin raised his voice as well, interrupting the tirade of the Second Prince. "Then why did you do it, your Highness? Your position was already secured; his Majesty was intent on passing on the throne to you. His support of the other princes was just for show; it wouldn't have changed anything!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hah!" The Second Prince's laughter was shrill. "Did you say that Father wanted to pass on the throne to me? He'd wanted to give it to the other princes as well! He was the one who fuelled the growth of my brothers, and forced me to the state I am in today! He is so heartless!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin kept mum, hiding his disappointment and sadness behind a mask.</span></p>
 <p><span>The laughter died down, and his voice turned into a low mumble. "Moyin, I know that I am wrong. I know that I would remain the Heir if I'd done what you'd said, and ascend to the throne. But do you know the feeling of power? The feeling when you can decide the lives of others in a single word? An ounce of power may sate a person, but it will also bring about a thirst that can only be quenched by more power. That was all that I could think about; I dreamt of it even in my dreams. I, have forgotten why we'd started out in the first place."</span></p>
 <p><span>His voice was barely audible. "I have failed you, Moyin. I've wasted your talents and wisdom; you could have supported someone else."</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin could not bear to listen to his words any longer. </span><i><span>Why did I come here, even if I knew that I had no way of helping him?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Your Highness." Jiang Moyin knelt on both knees and kowtowed. "I, Jiang Moyin, have never regretted supporting you, befriending you, and being your Grand Tutor." In some ways, he was also a casualty of the game of thrones. His body was burnt out from advising the Second Prince, all for the dream of seeing his vision of the Xuan kingdom before his death. But now, his days were numbered, and his dreams destroyed. He has lost, and he will accept it.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Second Prince's body shook with emotion. Then, he exploded into laughter, the sound ringing through the prison. Jiang Moyin stood up, gave a last long look at the prince, and turned to leave the Imperial Prison. When the laughter has finally died down, the eyes of the Second Prince landed on the porcelain bottle in the cell. Holding it up in his two hands, he let out a smile of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin left the prison to find the skies still drizzling. </span><i><span>Are these tears of sorrow?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Cough! Cough!" A fit of cough racked Jiang Moyin's frame as he covered his mouth, opening it to reveal a pool of blood so dark it looked black. His smile widened, and his eyes slowly closed, as if listening to the sound of death approaching.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>In court, the original supporters of the Second Prince were quickly removed from power. Those that had blood on their hands were stripped of their positions or depending on the gravity of the crimes, sentenced to death. His alliance fell apart quicker than that of the Seventh Prince the year before.</span></p>
 <p><span>Meanwhile, the First Prince had begun to receive guests at his residence. The Emperor had made it known to the court that he wanted their respect and help for the First Prince, because "he is the eldest son of the Imperial Family". His words quickly turned the First Prince into the subject of discussion for the court, and the Eighth Prince quickly turned his attention to his eldest brother. Situ scoffed when he'd heard of the Emperor's words, but still, he instructed Gan Qingjia to step forward and provide support for the First Prince, just in case if the Emperor decided to abandon kinship once and for all.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia also assumed the official duty of the Imperial Treasurer, and hence the title of "Xuan's youngest Rank Two Official". Xue Yiqi's performance on the day of the coup had also earned him a promotion to the Chief of the Palace Guards.</span></p>
 <p><span>Meanwhile, Feng Luodi's days were split into three parts: mornings in the Feng household, noon at the Duke's residence, and afternoons at the Jiang residence. Her packed schedule quickly took a toll on her, evidently seen from her loss of weight. Situ had tried repeatedly to stop her, but Feng Luodi's stubbornness was too much for him to handle. Every time he tried to feign anger and raise his voice, Feng Luodi put on her puppy eyes and the better was already lost. Situ sighed, he'd tried to make Feng Luodi his woman to no avail, and now he even had to listen to her! Worst of all, he no longer had anyone to complain to: Gan Qingjia was satisfied with his Qi beauty and no longer had an interest in having drinks with his brother.</span></p>
 <p><span>One day, the First Prince and Situ were summoned to the Imperial Study after the dismissal of the court. The two exchanged a look, their gaze quickly turning back to the Emperor who had his back to them. All of a sudden, the Emperor raged and swept the reports on his table onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span>"What treachery is this? Are these people trying to stage a rebellion?"</span></p>
 <p><span>The two of them frowned but kept mum. The Emperor continued, folding a report into a square and tossing it at the First Prince. "Just look at that! Tell me if those commoners still have any respect for me!"</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a report from Governor Cao of the Dingtao Province, regarding the murder of fifteen county magistrates of the Dingtao Province in one night. It has been deemed to be an act of the men of the </span><i><span>jianghu</span></i><span>, and the governor requests for help from the Emperor to bring justice upon the murderers.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Murdering fifteen officers of my kingdom! Are the men of the </span><i><span>jianghu </span></i><span>trying to challenge my authority?" The anger did not subside from the Emperor's face. The Imperial Attendant stood at the side in fear, not wanting to get close to the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span>A line in the report caught the attention of the First Prince. </span><i><span>The men of the jianghu seem to want to draw the line between the kingdom and the matters of the jianghu; the kingdom should not interfere in the proceedings of the jianghu. </span></i><span>That must be what sparked the anger of the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince exchanged a look with Situ. "Father, I believe that the kingdom comes before everything else in these lands. We should send someone to the Dingtao Province and get to the bottom of the matter. It should also serve as a wakeup call to the men of the </span><i><span>jianghu.</span></i><span>"</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor turned around, pleased by the words of the First Prince. "That was what I'd thought of as well. You have yet to be entrusted with any important matters since your return to Chang'an, and this shall be your first assignment. Leave no stone unturned."</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince bowed his head. "Yes, Father."</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor turned to Situ. "Ran'er still lacks the ability to handle the situation on his own. Please accompany him this time, Anping Duke. Ensure his safety, and provide assistance in the investigation."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ bowed his head as well, hiding the look of confusion in his eyes. "Yes, Your Majesty."</span></p>
