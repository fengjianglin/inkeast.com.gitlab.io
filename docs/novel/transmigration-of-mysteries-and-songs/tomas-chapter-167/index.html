 <p>Chapter 167: Green Vines: Danger In Chang’an</p> 
 <p>After his assignment in Ding Tao, the First Prince gained rapport amongst the civilians. At the same time, Situ and the First Prince were very satisfied with Xue Yiqi’s performance this time. From a certain point of view, this was a double harvest.</p> 
 <p>After solving the case of the murder of officials, it was the first time the First Prince officially revealed himself in the imperial court. Most of the officials had a good impression of the First Prince and felt that he reminded them of Empress Zhaoren.</p> 
 <p>The imperial aura on the First Prince did not disappear just because he was sent to exile. The First Prince, Liu Ran, was the oldest son of the Emperor. His mother was Empress Zhaoren and he had the aura of the imperial family.</p> 
 <p>Such words started spreading through Chang’an.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi knew how the First Prince gained the likes of the civilians. After all, he could just find ways to solve their problems just by opening his mouth. This was the result of his hard work over the years. Also, the First Prince had a soft nature. Besides his desire for the throne, Feng Luodi couldn’t find any other problems with him.</p> 
 <p><em>Situ’s decision is correct.</em> Feng Luodi had always believed in that.</p> 
 <p>However, on their way back to Chang’an, they had met with many assassinations. The smell of blood stung her nose and the shrill screams made her unable to sleep. She didn’t dare to look at the wounds on the bodies of the Covert Guards. But she knew that this was just the first step. As the First Prince gets nearer to the throne and gains favor with the Emperor, they would be in greater danger. And out of everyone, the one who would experience the greatest danger would be Situ.</p> 
 <p>When they alighted from the carriage and heard the people on the streets talking about the First Prince, they didn’t feel happy. Instead, they were worried. All Emperors feel uneasy towards someone whose achievements were greater than theirs. Situ was already viewed as a god of war. Now that he has joined forces with a maganimous First Prince, the Emperor might do things that would make the Eight Prince very happy.</p> 
 <p>“Duo would send you back. I will go into the palace with the First Prince.”</p> 
 <p>Situ organised her carriage for her and let the Covert Guards sent Feng Luod home.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi couldn’t hide her worry. They used a trick this time and allowed the Demonic Sect to change their name to the XIaoyao Sect. Then they killed Xiao Bang and his gang and named them the Demonic Sect. Without a doubt, the Emperor would learn of this somehow. Of course, the Eight Prince would incite the Emperor relentlessly. No one knows what the Emperor would do.</p> 
 <p>What would be waiting for Situ and the First Prince, in the depths of the palace?</p> 
 <p>Those were the nightmares that haunted Feng Luodi. Besides her parents in her past life who was waiting for her to wake up, her entire heart was on Situ Muye.</p> 
 <p>Even though she had so many thoughts in her mind, Feng Luodi only said, “Remember to look for me when you come out.”</p> 
 <p>Situ nodded. The First Prince and he took a horse each and rode off with most of the people.</p> 
 <p>“Tsk tsk, are you worried about your lover?” A teasing voice sounded.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi turned around to see Shangguan Yan lifting up the curtain. Under the violent objection of Xu Yiqi, Shangguan Yan finally wore normal clothes. However, the colours were very bright and it made her looked really pretty.</p> 
 <p>Speaking of Xue Yiqi and Shangguan Yan, Feng Luodi remembered the time when they were preparing to leave Dingtao province. Shangguan Yan rode on a white horse and caught up with them, telling them that she wanted to go to Chang’an with them. Anyone could tell that Shangguan Yan was here for Xue Yiqi but Xue Yiqi was a little slow on the uptake. Shuangguan Yan told him that she wanted to explore Chang’an with her new friend, Feng Luodi, and wanted to visit the Feng residence too.</p> 
 <p>That way, Xue Yiqi couldn’t chase Shangguan Yan away.</p> 
 <p>Along the way, however, Xue Yiqi received new orders and entered Chang’an disguised, returning to his position as the Chief of the Palatial Guards. Hence, for the rest of the journey, Shangguan Yan would find Feng Luodi to ask about Xue Yiqi, causing Situ to lose the chance to be with his lover. He was displeased with Shangguan Yan.</p> 
 <p>“Miss Shangguan, what would happen to the Xiaoyao Sect now that you are here in Chang’an? Feng Luodi asked her immediately when she got on the carriage.</p> 
 <p>“There is still Buping,” Shangguan Yan waved her hands without any concern. She lifted the curtain and looked outside. Her face was filled with curiosity, “Qi’er is in the headquarters. He will love this job.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi laughed. This was not the first time she used Lu Buping’s crush to ask Lu Buping to do things.</p> 
 <p>“Miss Shangguan,” Feng Luodi hesitated. She took her Green Vines, but she would definitely interfere with her relationship with Xue Yiqi so is it still possible to ask her for help?</p> 
 <p>“Why do you always hesitate when you speak?” The unruliness of a <em>Jianghu</em> person displayed on Shangguan Yan.</p> 
 <p>“You want to find the Eldritch Physician Xia Jingfeng to cure your elder brother right?” Shangguan Yan smiled cunningly. “I have already sent a letter to inform him. He will reach Chang’an in a few days. You can trust me.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi was grateful but puzzled as well. “Miss Shangguan, how do you know about this?”</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan pouted, “It was your lover. He promised me…” Shangguan Yan stopped halfway. She smiled cheekily.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi was even more puzzled.</p> 
 <p>The carriage moved slowly. It passed the streets of Chang’an that hadn’t changed at all. When they walked past the Autumnal Ombre, the people hired by Qi Jianqiu were bustling around busily.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi thought for a while and decided to go back to the Feng residence first. Lady Feng would be waiting for her along with Fei, Jet, and Scarlet.</p> 
 <p>However, Shangguan Yan wanted to get off the carriage because she smelt the wine. “You can tell that it is good wine just by the smell. I must get down and have two servings.”</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan raised her hand to lift the curtains.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi stopped her with a smile. “If you want to drink the Autumnal Ombre, it is simple. I can ask them to send it to the residence.”</p> 
 <p>“Send it directly?” Shangguan Yan widened her eyes. The wine smelled strong. It must be quite expensive.</p> 
 <p>“Of course,” Feng Luodi finally felt at home. “I opened this winery with my friend.”</p> 
 <p>“Really!” Shangguan Yan’s eyes turned bright like stars. She shook Feng Luodi’s hand like a little child. “What else do you have in your shop? I want to try all of them.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi smiled, “You can try as many times as you want. There is not only the signature Autumnal Ombre, but there is also out homebrew perry, osmanthus wine, chrysanthemum wine and all sorts of fruit wines. If it is summer now, I can make the Light of Summer for you.”</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan eyes brightened even more with each name and in the end, her eyes were so bright no one could possibly bear to look away. Shangguan Yan made a decision in her heart. She not only had to subdue Xue Yiqi, but she must also become good friends with Feng Luodi. She could salivate just from hearing the names of the wines.</p> 
 <p>When they reached the Feng residence, Fei and the rest of the people were already waiting outside for Feng Luodi. They widened their eyes when they saw the beautiful Shangguan Yan.</p> 
 <p><em>Why are all of young miss’ friends so beautiful?</em></p> 
 <p>The moment she got off the carriage, Shangguan Yan felt a gaze and turned her head immediately. She looked around sharply and sneered.</p> 
 <p>“What is the matter?” Feng Luodi saw Shangguan Yan’s expression when she turned back and asked her curiously.</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan slowly retracted her gaze. Her eyes landed on Duo and said calmly, “You must be an important person. There are so many people monitoring you.”</p> 
 <p>Duo’s expression changed. He was already considered powerful among the Covert Guards, be it the martial arts or other skills, and there were not many people that was his match. However, Shangguan Yan was the one who noticed the danger before he did. If it was not for Shangguan Yan, he would be held responsible if Miss Feng met with any danger in the future.</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan was satisfied with the expression on Duo’s face. She patted Feng Luodi on her shoulder and said, “Ask your lover’s henchmen to stand down. I alone am enough.”</p> 
 <p>Duo and the rest of the people in the shadows stiffened.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi smiled at Duo to appease him and said to Shangguan Yan, who didn’t have any other intentions, “Thank you, but there is no need for that. I trust the people that Situ chose.”</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan’s face froze and then she pouted, “Of course, you would stand on the side of your lover.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi smiled and signalled for Shangguan Yan to make a move. Shangguan Yan gave an awkward smile to Jet and Scarlet who were looking at her curiously and walked in front.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi followed behind her.</p> 
 <p>Scarlet and the rest of them went up to her and started talking, “Young Miss, you are finally back. You went away for three months this time. We miss you.”</p> 
 <p>Jet had tears in her eyes. Scarlet pushed her away in disdain.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi smiled and patted his head, “Aren’t I back now? How old are you already? Why are you still crying?”</p> 
 <p>Scarlet joined in the teasing. “When you were away, she couldn’t eat or sleep properly. She even got skinnier.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi took a closer look. <em>That really seemed to be the case.</em></p> 
 <p>She looked at Fei who was smiling and exclaimed, “You have grown taller and seemed more like a man now. After another year or two, you can get married.”</p> 
 <p>Fei gave an appropriate smile, “Thankyou for your concern, young miss. I still have much to learn.”</p> 
 <p>Jet pouted, “Stop pretending. Lady said that you with your talent, you can go for the imperial exam. Your businesses are getting better and better. You must be laughing inside.”</p> 
 <p>Fet gave a helpless look, “Jet, you are accusing me.”</p> 
 <p>Jet turned her face away.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi smiled warmly. <em>It is good to be back.</em></p> 
 <p>When she looked up again, she saw Shangguan Yan in deep thought. The loneliness in her eyes did not escape Feng Luodi.</p> 
 <p>“Miss Shangguan, let me introduce you to my mother. She’ll definitely like you.”</p> 
 <p>“Huh?” Shangguan Yan snapped out of her reverie. “Do I still need to go and meet elders?”</p> 
 <p>“Of course,” Feng Luodi smiled.</p>
