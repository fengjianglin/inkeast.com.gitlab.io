 <p><span>Chapter 160 Green Vines: Imperial Decree</span></p>
 <p><span>The news that Lu Buping and the Convert Watch brought back caused everyone to turn serious. The few of them moved to Situ’s courtyard. No one had the mood to admire the falling of the blossoms anymore. Some of them sat down while others remain standing. After a long time, Lu Buping said, “These were all planned. These people want to annihilate us. Hmph, how can it be so easy?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ took the tea that Feng Luodi made for him and had a sip. He slowly said, “They are not stupid. Let’s see what they will do.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lu Buping turned around and looked at Situ, his handsome face shining under the sunlight. You could see the unruliness under his eyes as well as the arrogance of a Jianghu person. “Do we have an agreement?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi blinked and looked at Situ. Situ put down his teacup and said slowly, “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lu Buping immediately turned and walked out. “I will go and arrange it immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi and Two looked at each other. What agreement did Situ and Lu Buping reach? How did they not notice anything?</span></p>
 <p><span>Although she didn’t know what Situ and Lu Bupig agreed on, Feng Luodi trusted Situ totally and thought that the First Prince would naturally support the decision that Situ made.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, when the First Prince came back at night and heard the things Two reported to him, he raised his eyebrows and knocked on the table with his fingers. Feng Luodi noticed this and looked down. Everyone has some small habits that they don’t even notice. This is something accumulated over the years. For example, Situ liked to take the lid of the teacup and slowly move it over his tea when he was in deep thought. When he was in anger, he would stare right at the person and when he was happy, the mist in his eyes would disappear.</span></p>
 <p><span>As for the First Prince, based on Feng Luodi’s observation, he would always smile when he was thinking and if he knocked on the table with his fingers, it meant that he was hesitating.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>What is the first Prince hesitating about?</span></i><span> Feng Luodi really wanted to know. Situ and the First Prince were on the same side. This was something the first Prince had agreed to.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, the next moment, Feng Luodi knew why the First Prince was hesitating.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Situ, we know nothing about the attitude of my father.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ lifted his teacup again. He just held it without drinking it nor saying anything. After a while, Situ said calmly, “We will wait for another day then.” </span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince smiled and left, satisfied with the result. Feng Luodi looked at the expressionless Situ worriedly. No words were needed. She believed him.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>The next day, Feng Luodi went out of the room after washing up and saw Situ standing under the blossom tree with his hands behind his back. Quattor and Duo were standing near him reporting the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Please pardon us, General. The leaders of the sects were very powerful. If I go any nearer, they will notice my presence.” Duo felt ashamed and was not satisfied with his own abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the other hand, Quattor was furious.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Although I could not hear what they were discussing, it is a fact that they met with Governor Tian. Governor Tian is a smiling fox. On the surface, he seemed to be cooperating with us to investigate the case but behind our back, no one knows what they are planning.” Quattor got more and more worked up as he talked. Duo pulled his sleeve and shook his head at him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Quattor swallowed the rest of his words and instead, said, “I will continue to watch over Governor Tian. When there is no one around him, I will take action.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ slowly turned around and looked passed the two Covert Guards at Feng Luodi. </span></p>
 <p><span>He said softly, “Go ahead. It is time to call Six back.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Duo’s face brightened and nodded his head immediately. “Yes, I will see to it immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span>After the two had left, Feng Luodi came over with a smile. She asked, “Is Six a member of the Covert Guards too?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ nodded, “He is only two years older than Zero.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi tiptoed and flicked the flower petals off Situ’s shoulders. Her voice was clear and pleasant like the sound of waves, “Two is the oldest and most prudent. Duo is more playful but he knows how to observe the reactions and expressions of people and handles things well. Quattor is too playful but his skills are one of the best. Zero is the youngest and most innocent. However, he is decisive and this point is similar to you. What about Six?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ looked down at Feng Luodi. The cold wind blew against the blossoms and the smell of blossoms seeped out.</span></p>
 <p><span>“His martial arts are very good.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“How good?” Feng Luodi continued looking up. Her eyes smiled till they became half-moons.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ finally smiled. He said in his low voice, “Better than mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi widened her eyes slightly, laughter in her eyes. “You are not humble at all.” She pulled Situ’s hand and brought him out of the courtyard. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Let’s go get breakfast.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ smiled and followed her. </span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince came after they finished their meal. His eyes were as gentle as always and sincerity hung on the corners of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I have been here for so long and no one had come to the Yamen to lodge a complain. Governor Tian really governs this place well.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Governor Tian, who came in after him, froze and then said with great respect, “You flatter me, your Highness. It might be that the civilians knew about your brilliance and no one dared to commit any crimes.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Governor Tian did not know that one of the few things the First Prince hated was flattery. Or rather, even when he reached the peak, he would not be able to accept other people’s flattery.</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince sat down quietly and ignored Governor Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>Governor Tian smiled awkwardly and greeted Situ, “Good morning, Duke.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi sat on one side and waited for Situ’s reaction, curiosity nibbling at her. Governor Tian’s pretence was full of loopholes but still, he continued to put on a show in front of them. Was he not afraid that he would be exposed or was he planning something else? Feng Luodi felt that there was not enough brain power for her to use. As she stayed beside Situ, there would always be many uncontrollable things happening. While it was exciting and fun, there will always be fear after the event.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ seemed to fell Feng Luodi’s uneasiness. He raised his hand and patted Feng Luodi’s hand, ignoring everyone else at the scene. Feng Luodi felt embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Governor Tian felt even more embarrassed. </span><i><span>Did I just get ignored completely? </span></i><span>Governor Tian felt that he was a hindrance and wanted to leave. However, at that moment, he heard Situ’s voice resounding in the antechamber.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Oh right, Governor Tian,” Situ paused slightly, “I found Lu Buping quite suspicious and have already locked him up in prison. I didn’t have the time to tell you this. Sorry about that.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Which part of him looks sorry? </span></i><span>Feng Luodi was speechless at Situ However, she was more curious as to why Situ would say this.</span></p>
 <p><span>A hint of anxiousness flashed passed Governor Tian’s eyes. Everyone noticed it</span></p>
 <p><span>Governor Tian forced a smile, “Of course you can make the decision. However, may I know the reason why you suspect Lu Buping?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ raised his eyebrows and looked at Governor Tian mysteriously.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I will present the evidence to you later. In the meantime, please guard the prison well. Trouble is sure to follow if such an important criminal escapes.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Governor Tian nodded and hurried out, almost tripping over the doorframe in his haste.</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince smiled at Governor Tian’s retreating figure. “Seems like you’re not satisfied with my decision, Situ. Fine, you can do what you like.” The First Prince finished his sentence and wanted to stand up. Feng Luodi was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span>At this moment, Governor Tian came back again. He panted and said, “Your Highness, Duke, the Imperial Decree from Chang’an is here.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince was shocked. The quivering of his mouth corners betrayed his anxiousness. The Imperial Decree was always hard to predict. However, Situ’s eyes were quiet. He looked at the Assistant Chief of the Imperial Army walking over quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Since Situ was calm, Feng Luodi was calm as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Assistant Chief read the Imperial Decree and left hurriedly, leaving Situ and the rest with a piece of very big news. The Emperor had heard from somewhere that the culprit of this case was someone from the Demonic Sect. Hence, he gave an Imperial Decree personally to annihilate the Demonic Sect and appeased the civilians. Under special circumstance, they were authorized to mobilize the twenty thousand soldiers of the Central Army that was camped outside Xiangyang.</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince’s expression changed. He sent the suddenly composed Governor Tian away dismissed the attendants guarding the door. He summoned the Covert Guards in their place after confirming that they were surrounded by their own men, he said, “Father is trying to test your influence in the Central Army. After all, General Ji Buhui was once a General of the Northern Army.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ suddenly smiled. His eyes were dark. “This is not the first time the Emperor tested me. Also, the Shadow Guards that are monitoring you are still here.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince widened his eyes. The worry and puzzledness in his eyes changed back into coldness and calmness. This was the first time Feng Luodi saw the First Prince expressing his emotions outwards.</span></p>
 <p><span>“No wonder you wanted to lock Lu Buping up. You did it to show Father.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Even Feng Luodi was surprised by this. She didn’t ask Situ why he did it.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ replied indifferently, “I am afraid that the Eight Prince has a part to play too. If not, how can the Imperial Decree arrive so q</span><span>uickly?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince squinted slightly and turned to look out into the exquisite courtyard. “Father is really cruel. He wanted to use me from the start to scheme against you and we had no choice but to jump into this trap he’d set for us.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span>So the Emperor knew about everything that we were doing.</span></i><span> Feng Luodi was shocked. The Emperor that looked so gentle schemed even against his own son. </span><i><span>Seems like no matter what the First Prince do, he would never be in the Emperor’s favour.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>The room went silent. After a while, the First Prince regained his composure and gave a slight smile.</span></p>
 <p><span>“How should we deal with this now? We can’t use the army to annihilate the Demonic Sect, or we’d be falling into their trap. Also, the civilians of Dingtao shouldn’t get implicated as well. They are innocent. We need a thorough plan.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I understand,” Situ got serious, “If we want to avoid going against the Imperial Decree, we need to have a concrete plan.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi thought for a while and hesitated. “I have an idea, but it is quite risky.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ did not seek approval from the First Prince but turned immediately to Feng Luodi. “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi nodded but hesitated again.</span></p>
 <p><span>“We can make a play with words. The Emperor only gave this Imperial Decree based on what he heard from his Shadow Guards and the Eight Prince. He doesn’t know the situation here. As long as we settle it right, the Emperor can only accept the results.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi paused for a long while before continuing.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The Emperor asked us to annihilate the Demonic Sect, and that’s what we would do. However, it’ll be a different Demonic Sect from the one he’s expecting to be destroyed.”</span></p>
