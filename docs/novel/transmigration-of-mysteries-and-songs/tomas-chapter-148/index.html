 <p><span>Chapter 148 Burnt Ends: Before the Storm</span></p>
 <p><span>In a dining room on the third floor of Manchun Tang, Feng Luodi looked at Qi Jianqiu across the table, laughter in her eyes. The girl's cheeks were ruddy, a smile lighting up her face. Even after her marriage, she was still the undisputable "Beauty of Chang'an".</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ sat beside Feng Luodi, as did Gan Qingjia beside Qi Jianqiu.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Didn't you say that there was something to celebrate today?" Qi Jianqiu smiled as she spoke, her voice soft and gentle to the ears. "What's up?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia patted her lovingly. "It's a pity that the protagonist himself isn't here today; Yiqi is now the Chief of the Imperial Army."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Are you serious?" Qi Jianqiu was surprised, joy showing apparently on her face. The love triangle between them has already been resolved, Xue &nbsp;Yiqi giving up on her. "He's amazing!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia smiled dotingly at the genuine feelings of Qi Jianqiu. She was innocent and smart, beautiful but not petty. Feng Luodi, however, was a little confused at the sudden promotion of Xue Yiqi.</span></p>
 <p><span>"The Chief?" She knew that Xue Yiqi did not possess the seniority to lead an army of five thousand strong; his age would be a huge limiting factor in his command presence. It would've been much more likely if he was the Assistant Chief of the Imperial Army instead.</span></p>
 <p><span>"During the morning convention today, The Defender-in-chief has submitted his resignation to the Emperor, hoping to be allowed to be rid of his official duties. The eldest son of the Xue family is already the General-in-chief of the Western Army, and the glory of the Defender-in-chief will be inherited by Xue Yiqi."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi frowned. </span><i><span>What is the Emperor trying to do? First, he assigns Gan Qingjia to the role of the Imperial Treasurer, and now it's giving the position of the Chief of the Imperial Army to Xue Yiqi. Although both are in some ways done to repay the efforts of their fathers, it is too much of a coincidence! He has given so much power to the friends and brothers of Situ, thus gathering such power under the wings of the First Prince.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>Does he already know of Situ's allegiance to the First Prince? Is he really scheming all that? Is the increasing of support for the First Prince arranged by the Emperor as well? </span></i><span>Feng Luodi felt a cold sweat run down her back. </span><i><span>If that is true, Situ and the First Prince are in danger right now! Did the sacrifice of the Baicha Mountain Villa and the connections with the deceased Empress Zhaoren not move him one bit?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>The Emperor has always been wary of the First Prince! The Seventh Prince has been exiled, the Second Prince removed from his&nbsp;position; who else can he pass on the throne to? The Eighth Prince? Or is it the Eleventh Prince?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi felt as if her thoughts were all jumbled up in a mess. </span><i><span>This is so complicated…but I feel like I'm getting close to the truth...</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"No need to worry." Situ's voice was firm and reassuring. "It might be a venomous trap for us, but it can be used to our advantage."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi and Gan Qingjia understood his words. Naturally, Situ would have a better understanding of the situation than them. Feng Luodi held a hand to her chest. </span><i><span>But why do I still feel so uneasy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Only Qi Jianqiu was confused. "What are you guys talking about? What trap?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Oh, it's nothing." Gan Qingjia smiled and took her into his arms. "Weren't you about to present your newest dishes to us? Take them out!"</span></p>
 <p><span>The change of topic to her hobby quickly diverted her attention and Qi Jianqiu happily took out her food hamper. "I've brought my newest dishes today, but Yiqi isn't here yet! We can only start after he's here."</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia ignored her protests and reached across to take out dishes and plates from the hamper. "He won't be coming; there're too many people that're waiting for his attention. He'll still have to visit Moyin after he's done."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Alright then." Qi Jianqiu pouted a little, but quickly helped set the table, introducing each dish as she laid them out on the table. "I've made these specially for today's occasion! All of these dishes are named as good wishes for his career! We have the First Grade Official Swallow…"</span></p>
 <p><span>If it was a year before, Feng Luodi would be very interested in the dishes of her best friend. However, the very mention of Jiang Moyin left a heavy feeling in her heart, sadness apparent on her face. Her change went unnoticed by the joyful couple across the table, but Situ quickly picked up on it.</span></p>
 <p><span>He thought for a moment before leaning in to comfort her. "Why don't we go over tomorrow?" </span><i><span>I can't tell her about the poisoning of Moyin…</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi shook her head. "I just paid him a visit yesterday."</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia heard her words and looked at her, knowing that Lu Bo had told her everything. Even if Situ tried to hide it from her, it was but a futile attempt.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ's face changed, and he looked carefully at Feng Luodi. She was calm, though worried, and it set his heart at ease. </span><i><span>Thank god she doesn't know of Moyin's feelings for her, and only sees him as an elder brother.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>The meal commenced, and laughter sounded in the room. Halfway through the meal, QI Jianqiu suddenly came up with a suggestion. "Why don't we head out of the city tomorrow for some hiking? It's so boring to spend every day in the residence…"</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia shot her a look. "Are you sure you'd spent every day in the residence?" </span><i><span>Who's the one who spent all her free time in the orchards?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Qi Jianqiu blushed, and returned the look with a glare. "Hmmm?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia's face changed, and he quickly put on a smile, turning to Feng Luodi and Situ. "I'm on a break tomorrow, shall we go?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Not waiting for Feng Luodi's reply, Situ nodded. "Of course. We'll see you at the southern gate tomorrow morning at 9."</span></p>
 <p><span>"No problem." Gan Qingjia nodded, raising an eyebrow cheekily at Qi Jianqiu. Qi Jianqiu blushed and quickly turned back to her food. Only Situ saw the sadness in Feng Luodi's eyes, and a glint flashed through his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>The meal ended soon, and Gan Qingjia left with Qi Jianqiu. Feng Luodi and Situ sat alone in the room, neither of them speaking a word. Situ poured a cup of tea for Feng Luodi quietly, not wanting to disturb her thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi slowly spoke again. "How is the First Prince looking currently in court?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ was surprised. He'd assumed that Feng Luodi's sadness and worry was only for Jiang Moyin. His features softened, and so did his voice. "With his ten years of experience back in the Yi province, his knowledge of certain policies and proceedings of the court has helped him build some rapport with the other officials. They may not lend their support to him, but at least he wouldn't be targeted."</span></p>
 <p><span>"What about the Emperor?" Feng Luodi's eyes were bright.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ thought for a second, a slight frown appearing on his face. "I guess he's appreciating his talent and abilities. Things are much better than before, that's for certain."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi reached out and smoothened his frown. "Do you think that the change in attitude is because of the First Prince, or does it stem from the Emperor himself?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Her words might seem random to a stranger, but Situ immediately understood what she was saying. A glint flashed in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi did not comment anymore. She dragged the brazier closer to herself and set a pot of tea to brew. The way Situ looked at Feng Luodi had changed. He had told her much about the happenings in court and of his own plans, but if it was not for her reminder, he might have fallen headfirst into the trap laid out for him. He knew that his love had few friends outside of their circle, and her wit was not enough of an explanation for her deduction.</span></p>
 <p><span>Does she have another source of information?</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>The next day, the four friends set off for the mountains with two horse in tow, food and wine aplenty. The colours of Autumn had set in, and the valley at the foot of the hill was filled with red maple leaves. Covered in layers of light yellow to dark red, the mist that swirled around the valley lent it an air of serenity. The light caught onto the fluttering leaves, and the scene seemed like one out of an enchanted painting.</span></p>
 <p><span>The four of them slowly strolled along a stream in the middle of the valley. Qi Jianqiu could not hold in her excitement, dragging Gan Qingjia towards the right side of the road, where the sounds of flowing water came from. When they were sure that they were out of the sights of Situ and Feng Luodi, Qi Jianqiu quickly dragged Gan Qingjia into a bush, peering at Feng Luodi and Situ through the leaves.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Are you trying to bring them together?" Gan Qingjia smiled at his wife's childish behaviour.</span></p>
 <p><span>"That's right! They've always been taking it so slowly…even I'm getting anxious for them!" Qi Jianqiu puffed up her cheeks, but the subjects of her scrutiny merely strolled on side by side.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Sigh." Gan Qingjia sighed and wrapped his arms around Qi Jianqiu, patting her lightly on her forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hey! What are you doing?" Qi Jianqiu glared at him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia ignored her protests and leaned closer, puffing gently into her ear. "Let me tell you a secret."</span></p>
 <p><span>"What secret?" Qi Jianqiu's interest was piqued.</span></p>
 <p><span>"They're already a couple." Gan Qingjia whispered. Not giving her a chance to digest his words, he leaned in for a kiss.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ and Feng Luodi slowly ascended the hill, stopping to rest under a huge maple tree. The ground was already carpeted in a layer of red maple leaves. Feng Luodi took an immediate liking to the place.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Let's stop here and have a drink."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi waited under the tree as Situ went to retrieve the wine from their steeds. When he returned, he looked up to see Feng Luodi smiling at him. Perhaps it was because of the whirlwind of red maple leaves that swirled around her like a cape, he found her smile dazzling and bewitching.</span></p>
 <p><span>The red in the trees, the red on the floor, and the few spots of red maple leaves that landed on her shoulders seemed to shroud Feng Luodi in a traditional red wedding gown.</span></p>
 <p><span>That Autumn, the beauty smiled at him, dressed in the blazing red of a wedding gown.</span></p>
