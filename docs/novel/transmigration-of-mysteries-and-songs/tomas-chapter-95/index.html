 <p><span>Chapter 95 Cloud Nine: Marriage</span></p>
 <p><span>"Take note of everything Yao'er eats; if you need anything, request directly from the Imperial Quartermaster; they will know that it is by my decree. All of you </span><i><span>mamas </span></i><span>and handmaidens keep your wits about you; make sure that my Concubine is well taken of." The Emperor half-jokingly said to the attendants and handmaidens in Concubine Yao's residence.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Yes, your Majesty." They curtsied.</span></p>
 <p><span>"There's no need to worry, your Majesty. They've been taking good care of me all the while; nothing bad can happen." Concubine Yao leaned lightly onto him, her eyes gentle and docile.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Things are different now. You carry my child in you and it can never hurt to be extra careful with everything you do." The Emperor gently rubbed her abdomen. "I'd never expected to have another child at my age! The gods themselves must be smiling upon our lineage."</span></p>
 <p><span>"You're not old at all, your Majesty! Stop saying such nonsense!" Concubine Yao chided gently, snuggling into the Emperor's embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Well well, you do indeed have the sweetest words for me, don't you?" The Emperor tightened his embrace around Concubine Yao and gently stroked her hair. "Finally, you'll have someone else to rely on after all these years in the palace. Even if I'm no longer here, there's someone who can be there for you."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your Majesty!" Concubine Yao quickly cupped his mouth. "Yao'er doesn't like hearing you talk like that, your Majesty! I want to spend the rest of my life with you."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Alright, alright. I'll stop here." The Emperor smiled. "Anyway, why don't I see your younger sister here? If I remember correctly, she does love spending time with you."</span></p>
 <p><span>Concubine Yao smiled lightly. "She's been grounded by Father over some mistake she's committed. Your Majesty must know how Father is strict with his rules, but my younger sister has always been a little rebellious. Although she can be rash at times, she respects my father a lot and will never go against his will on purpose. I can't meet here even if I want to nowadays."</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor smiled and shook his head. "I know what Minister Qi is like; I can barely stand him even though I only meet him once a day. It's only natural that your younger sister will be punished by him, seeing as how they spend every day together under the same roof. If you miss her that much, I'm sure the Minister will let her come if I request that of him."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Thank you for sympathizing with me, your Majesty." Concubine Yao quickly curtsied. "Let me show my gratitude on behalf of my younger sister, your Majesty."</span></p>
 <p><span>"No need to be so formal with me, Yao'er." The Emperor quickly helped her up. "It'll be perfect if you could teach your sister to be as gentle as you are, seeing as how beautiful she already is."</span></p>
 <p><span>"I will, your Majesty." Concubine Yao bowed her head, hiding her eyes from the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I know I can count on you." The Emperor continued to smile.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your Majesty, will you like to try some of the snacks that I've made today?" Concubine Yao waved her hand, and a handmaiden brought a few dishes to the table.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor looked at the exquisite culinary delights on the table and laughed. "Your culinary skills have always been impressive, Yao'er. Looks like I'm in for a treat today." Before he could reach for the food, an attendant's voice sounded from outside the room.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your Majesty, the Duke of Anping is waiting for you in the Imperial Study."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Oh right!" The Emperor rubbed his forehead lightly. "How could I have forgotten about that! I must have missed it out in my hurry to see you."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your duties are taxing and far more important than me, your Majesty." Concubine Yao gently got up from his embrace. "Go ahead, your Majesty. I'll leave the snacks right here and you can have them when you're done with your duties."</span></p>
 <p><span>"You're a sensible woman, and that's what I like about you." The Emperor stood up and brushed her nose, turning to leave the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span>A handmaiden delivered medicine from the kitchen, smiling at Concubine Yao. "His Majesty does dote on you a lot, doesn't he? He's never as gentle with the other concubines as he is with you."</span></p>
 <p><span>Concubine Yao smiled but did not speak, a hint of sadness in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>"Duke of Anping. Your reports of the situation in the North the other time were very pleasant to read indeed." The Emperor smiled at Situ from his seat behind the desk. "I believe that the situation in the North has been defused for the time being - and it's all thanks to you. Tell me, what will you like to be rewarded with this time?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"It is my duty as a General of the kingdom to serve you and you only, your Majesty. How can I possibly ask for anything in return?" Situ quickly bowed. "The other generals in the North are more deserving of such rewards, your Majesty."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Oh, stop being so humble, Anping Duke. They can wait for their turn when they come back to the capital. You are the one before me right now." The Emperor waved a hand in the air. "Since you wouldn't tell me what you want, let me make the decision for you."</span></p>
 <p><span>He paused for a second. "You're almost twenty-eight years old soon, Anping Duke. It isn't right for you to not have a woman by your side. Let me change that for you. What do you think of my fifth daughter, Princess Shangrong? She's talented and bold - a perfect match for you."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ jumped to his feet again, quickly rejecting the proposal. "I thank you for your kindness, your Majesty. But Princess Shangrong is of royal descent and I dare not taint her with my lowly status."</span></p>
 <p><span>"What nonsense!" The Emperor smiled. "There isn't a more accomplished young man within the city walls than you. Shang'er and you are a match made in heaven; I'm sure the marriage will be a fulfilling one indeed."</span></p>
 <p><span>"I cannot wed the Princess, your Majesty." Situ took a deep breath. "There is already someone in my heart. I have promised her that I will not wed anyone else in my life besides her; you know how much I value my promises, your Majesty. Moreover, I cannot marry Princess Shangrong with another person in my heart; the princess deserves someone better."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Oh?" The Emperor dragged out his exclamation. "I was unaware that you already had someone in mind. I'll like to meet her in person."</span></p>
 <p><span>"She is but the daughter of a simple official, your Majesty. She is unfit to be in your imperial presence."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Well well, how many times have you turned down my marriage proposals already? You've got to tell me how this woman attracts you at the very least!" The Emperor said half-jokingly. He chuckled, but the laughter did not reach his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ did not notice the Emperor's displeasure, now immersed in his feelings for Feng Luodi. He smiled and his expression softened. "A third of her is always composed, and another third is lively and joyful. The remaining bits of her is a mixture of melancholy, charm, and wit - and that is what draws me to her."</span></p>
 <p><span>"She does sound special indeed." The Emperor was relentless. "But knowing you, it seems unbelievable that you haven't won her hand yet."</span></p>
 <p><span>"She is…special like you said," Situ did not bother hiding it from the Emperor anymore. "and that is why she refuses to marry me simply because of my status. We still have a long way to go ahead of us, your Majesty, and I hope you can make it easier for us."</span></p>
 <p><span>"If you're so in love with her, what do you say if I arrange a marriage between the two of you?" The Emperor smiled lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I thank you for your good intentions, your Majesty, but I only want to marry her when I get her consent."</span></p>
 <p><span>"I see. Well, I should meddle no more in your affairs then." The Emperor finally decided to put the discussion aside. "The children of the Huaiyang Commandery Prince are coming to Chang'an soon and the Eighth Prince is tasked, by me, to welcome them. Check on him if you have time and guide him along if he needs help."</span></p>
 <p><span>"It will be my honour to serve the Eighth Prince as well." Situ released the breath he did not know he had been holding.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Alright, that's all I have to say. You may leave. Have a good rest; the journey to the North must have been taxing."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Thank you for your concern, your Majesty. I shall take my leave." Situ bowed and turned to leave the Imperial Study.</span></p>
 <p><span>As Situ's figure disappeared from view, the Emperor slowly walked down the platform his desk was on. He paced around the study, a slight smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Attendant. Is this the third time the Duke of Anping has rejected my arrange marriages for him?" His calm expression had twisted into one of anger as he drove his foot into a chair in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span>The attendant quickly knelt down, sensing the Emperor's rage. "That is only because you have been too kind to him, your Majesty. The Duke had also mentioned a person who'd already had a place in his heart; no need for such anger, your Majesty."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Someone in his heart?" The Emperor sneered. No trace of his gentle demeanor remained; all that was left was the wrath of a king. "That is nothing but an excuse to spurn me! If I had not pushed him as I did today, he might not have even bothered to think of an excuse for me! He's the first person who dared to defy my will."</span></p>
 <p><span>The attendant kept his head as close to the floor as possible. "The Duke is a vital keystone of the kingdom and your Majesty had always placed your trust in him. Perhaps that is the reason behind his…impudence."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hmph!" The Emperor shot a look at the attendant who was still on the floor. "Get off the ground and stop being so timid! This does not concern you at all."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Yes, your Majesty." The attendant shot a glance at the Emperor. "Your Majesty, do you plan on visiting Concubine Yao now?"</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor shook his head. "No. I've been feeling rather tired as of late."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Should I call for the Royal Physician?" The attendant was as respectful as he could be, knowing that the Emperor was in a bad mood.</span></p>
 <p><span>"No need for that. Probably just a side effect of aging, I reckon."</span></p>
