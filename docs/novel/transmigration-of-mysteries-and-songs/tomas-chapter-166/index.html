 <p>Chapter 166 Green Vines: The Settling Dust</p> 
 <p>The Emperor’s second imperial decree made Situ and the others understand that the Eighth Prince’s power had already reached the extent where it could not be stopped by the Emperor and the Eleventh Prince. In Dingtao Province, the most dangerous surveillants were not the Emperor’s shadow guards but the spies of the Eighth Prince.</p> 
 <p>“They are faster than I had expected,” Situ said indifferently. The astonishment in his eyes had already vanished.</p> 
 <p>When the first imperial decree was issued, that was the Emperor’s sounding them out and testing them. The Eighth Prince was powerless then. Whereas, now that the second imperial decree was issued, it signified that the Emperor is also no longer able to restrain the Eighth Prince's actions in Chang’an. He needed the First Prince to return to Chang’an while the Eighth Prince hoped that the First Prince would immediately commit a crime after returning to Chang’an. Xue Yiqi was very worried as he looked at the First Prince whose expression had suddenly changed.</p> 
 <p>“If we don’t return to Chang’an quickly, it will be hard for Qingjia to control the general situation.”</p> 
 <p>The First Prince said faintly after a long while.</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness, you don't need to worry. We will set off in three days.”</p> 
 <p>Xue Yiqi and Feng Luodi cast a sidelong glance at Situ in surprise when they heard his words.</p> 
 <p>A delighted expression immediately flickered across the First Prince’s eyes. He knew that there was nothing Situ could not settle in this world. <em>With Situ’s support, I will definitely accomplish my great ambitions.</em></p> 
 <p><del>~~</del>~</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Shangguan Yan who was lying in ambush in the underground prison stretched her limbs out of boredom and complained to Lu Buping beside her.</p> 
 <p>“Will that Qing Cheng Sect’s leader really come? How can he not see through such an obvious trap?”</p> 
 <p>Lu Buping was still haunted by the traumatic experience in this underground prison and was currently feeling very uneasy.</p> 
 <p>“Probably. Situ understands some things really well, things such as the minds of people.”</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan twitched her mouth in disdain. “They are the ones who want to capture the culprit! Why are we the ones responsible for the ambush? We are martial arts experts. Why are we carrying out the jobs of the authorities?”</p> 
 <p><em>Wasn’t it because as soon as Xue Yiqi volunteered himself, you took on the responsibility yourself as you were afraid that he is no match for Sect Leader Xiao?</em> Lu Buping only dared to say this in his heart. If he had said it out loud, Shangguan Yan would definitely beat him up violently.</p> 
 <p>The two of them squatted on the beam of the underground prison until their legs were numb. While Governor Tian was detained in there, he still had a straw mat spread out to lie on so he was much more relaxed than them. Minutes passed again. Just as the impatient Shangguan Yan finally left, a few jailers silently collapsed onto the floor. Immediately, a person in black appeared in the underground prison.</p> 
 <p>“Governor Tian, I hope you have been well since we last met.”</p> 
 <p>The familiar chilly voice caused Governor Tian to spring up from his bed. He nervously looked at the person in black who was preparing to slash at the prison’s huge lock.</p> 
 <p>“Xiao Zhengran, are you really going to be this heartless and eradicate me?”</p> 
 <p>Qing Cheng Sect’s Sect Leader Xiao pulled down his mask, revealing a ruthless smile.</p> 
 <p>“Only the dead can’t talk.” As he spoke, he pulled out his sword and hacked it at him but it was stopped by a broadsword in midair.</p> 
 <p>“It’s you again, Lu Buping.” Xiao Zhengran’s expression became even more fiendish and his tone was fierce. “You think you can win me? I was merely feigning my skills at the hexagon pavilion back then.”</p> 
 <p>Lu Buping continued to use his sword to stop Xiao Zhengran’s next action. He raised the corner of his mouth, showing a condescending and ridiculing smile.</p> 
 <p>“Do you really think that I came alone? There are several people you can’t beat in this world and one of them is here today.”</p> 
 <p>Xiao Zhengran revealed an expression of contempt. Even the head of Wu Dang Sect had to show him respect for his martial arts prowess. <a href="#footnote-b503">[1]</a></p> 
 <p>Yet, immediately after that, red silk floated down from the ceiling, as if they were plum blossom petals falling one by one. A beautiful girl dressed in red appeared before Xiao Zhengran’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>“You’re merely a silly little lass. You’re so arrogant just because you think you are the leader of a sect.”</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan sneered, “At least I’m better than those who overestimate their abilities and want to become the chief of the entire martial arts community.”</p> 
 <p>Immediately, the sound of a sword slicing through the air rang through the underground prison.</p> 
 <p>~~~</p> 
 <p>Situ was well-prepared and confident. He had recently gathered and listed crimes related to Qing Cheng Sect into a yamen’s notice and posted it at every county in Ding Tao Province. Suddenly, Qing Cheng Sect’s disciples became the target of public castigation. Not only did they lose their places in the Righteous Path, they were also spurned by the people. Naturally, the power of the commoners’ words was the strongest. They were not satisfied with just denouncing the Qing Cheng Sect, they even berated all the people of the <em>jianghu</em>. All of a sudden, Dingtao Province, which was originally the place that had the most number of <em>jianghu</em> sects gathered had became the place that tolerates people from the <em>jianghu</em> the least.</p> 
 <p>The smoke of conflict between the commoners and the people of the <em>jianghu</em> had started to permeate the air. One party was unarmed and defenceless while the other party relied on the strong and picked on the weak.</p> 
 <p>At this moment, the Central Army station in Xiang Yang arrived in the vicinity of Ding Tao Province to encircle and annihilate a bunch of mountain brigands who have committed many serious crimes. There was a faint sign that they were going to stand on the opposing side of the people of the <em>jianghu</em>.</p> 
 <p>Therefore, the people of the <em>jianghu</em> in Dingtao Province did something for lack of a better option ー they went to the yamen to demand for justice.</p> 
 <p>“The Qing Cheng Sect is under its own rule. Our sect has nothing to do with them at all. On what basis are you prohibiting us from setting foot into Ding Tao Province?”</p> 
 <p>“There is still currently no concrete evidence corroborating that Sect Leader Xiao killed the fifteen county magistrates yet you have already dispatched the army to guard Ding Tao Province. Isn’t that going too far in abusing your power?”</p> 
 <p>Multifarious opinions and clamour made people unsure if they should laugh or cry.</p> 
 <p>“A cornered dog will jump over the wall, desperate situations will drive one to desperate measures.” Xue Yiqi did not have any favourable impression of these people from the <em>jianghu</em> who respond en masse and only knew how to fight but not use their brains. Although he had once envied the carefree and unfettered lifestyle of the <em>jianghu</em>, he finally realised that regardless of whether it was in the court or the <em>jianghu</em>, one was unable to act out of his own volition.</p> 
 <p>Situ had always viewed this indifferently.</p> 
 <p>What he was more concerned about this moment was Feng Luodi who had suddenly become very silent. Ever since Shangguan Yan had gifted her a zither, Feng Luodi’s mind had constantly been preoccupied and she had become completely different from the joyful and composed person she was when they first came to Ding Tao Province. This made him feel a sense of crisis regarding Feng Luodi’s remarks about leaving.</p> 
 <p>There many things that could not be controlled in the world. The amount of power a person has in his grasp did not represent how much he could control. He was adept in tactics and the arts of war but when it came to Feng Luodi, he was forever unable to guess her thoughts. Although it might sound ridiculous, this was the fact. A fact he cannot change.</p> 
 <p>“I wonder how it’s going at where Miss Shangguan and the others are?” Feng Luodi’s gentle voice sounded, jerking Situ’s out of his contemplation.</p> 
 <p>“The two of them are more than enough for dealing with Xiao Zhengran.”</p> 
 <p>Situ regarded Shangguan Yan and Lu Buping’s martial arts abilities highly but in terms of a person’s temperament, he still preferred the type of people like Xue Yiqi.</p> 
 <p>The people of the <em>jianghu</em> making a ruckus outside the yamen were clamouring more intensely and the commoners were starting to get unruly. The cold expression in the First Prince’s eyes became more intense.</p> 
 <p>Finally, Shangguan Yan walked out from the underground prison proudly. When she saw Xue Yiqi standing in the front courtyard, her originally cold and disdainful countenance immediately turned into one that was all smiles.</p> 
 <p>“Yiqi, I have caught Xiao Zhengran. Awesome, right?”</p> 
 <p>Lu Buping was dragging Xiao Zhengran who was riddled with bruises behind him. When he caught her expression that was seeking for commendation, the expression in his eyes instantly turned into one of helplessness.</p> 
 <p><em>Can’t our sect leader maintain a more elegant demeanour?</em></p> 
 <p>Xue Yiqi had heard how Xiao Zhengran’s martial arts was from Covert Guards Quattor and Duo. He was someone who could make the Covert Guards fear him and someone he could not defeat. Yet, this woman before him whose smiling face was like flowers and who did not rigidly adhere to common customs, had martial arts that had already reached this standard.</p> 
 <p>Xue Yiqi did not speak but as he was an honest person, the expression of admiration in his eyes could not deceive anyone.</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan who had noticed it was wreathed with smiles that spread to the tip of her eyebrows and corner of her eyes. Her originally beautiful features appeared even more biwitching. In addition, with her slightly revealing attire, it made many of the men who were present unable to shift their gaze away from her.</p> 
 <p>As expected, Xue Yiqi’s face was blushing furiously. He turned his gaze away unnaturally, making Shangguan Yan want to tease him even further. Situ’s attention was placed on Xiao Zhengran whose facial complexion was ashen while Covert Guard Two appeared just at the right time.</p> 
 <p>“General, I have found this sword in the inn Xiao Zhengran stays at.” The covert guard raised a sword that was wrapped in white cloth and slowly reported.</p> 
 <p>“This sword is eighty percent similar to the sword of Young Knight-errant Lu. The design of the sword’s body is also precisely the same. It looks like it was intentionally imitated.”</p> 
 <p>Situ nodded and instructed, “Since there is conclusive evidence, then we should let those people know.”</p> 
 <p>When the people of the <em>jianghu</em> who thought that they were standing on the side of reason discovered that Xiao Zhengran had admitted to the crime, one after another, they emphasised that they had no relationship to him and that they were innocent.</p> 
 <p>“This matter was solely the act of Sect Leader Xiao. We were all deceived and egged on by him. This matter has nothing to do with us.”</p> 
 <p>“Yes yes. It was him who has always targeted the Demonic Sect and schemed against the Demonic Sect multiple times. We are all innocent.”</p> 
 <p>His repulsive features were all exposed at this moment. Feng Luodi seemed to be able to understand why Shangguan Yan and the others were unwilling to expound everything to the outsiders. Most people would not have listened. They liked to use their own standards to judge other people. If others do not achieve their standards, it would mean that they are wrong. They always thought that they themselves are right and that their own standard was the world’s standard.</p> 
 <p><em>Such people are simply too scary!</em> Feng Luodi involuntarily shivered and moved closer to Situ.</p> 
 <p>Situ seemed to feel her uneasiness and placed his hand on her shoulder.</p> 
 <p>Xue Yiqi finally had enough of enduring this kind of situation and walked out of the yamen.</p> 
 <p>Under the sunlight, his face was full of righteousness. He had dashing straight eyebrows, a composed gaze and he pursed his lips until it was very straight.</p> 
 <p>It seemed like they were influenced by this kind of calm feelings. The surrounding commoners all quietened down while the people of the <em>jianghu</em> also revealed embarrassed expressions.</p> 
 <p>“According to Da Xuan’s laws, Xiao Zhengran will be subjected to the death penalty and nine familial exterminations.” <a href="#footnote-147e">[2]</a></p> 
 <p>The uprightness in his voice was like him.</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan could not help but reveal a smile. Her lustrous eyes which were like that of the stars were filled with that straight rear figure that would never bend.“As for the disciples of Qing Cheng Sect, all of them have to cooperate with the yamen’s investigations. None of those whose hands have been stained with human blood and committed sordid deeds will be able to escape. Those who have never committed any wrongs can disperse now. Remember this lesson about Xiao Zhengran. Practising martial arts is for the sake of strengthening the body and not to help the wicked to perpetuate their evil deeds.”</p> 
 <p>His silhouette was lit up from behind by the rays of the sun, and instilled in the crowd an urge to worship him.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi noticed that there was a gratified smile at the corner of Situ’s mouth and also smiled along with him.</p> 
 <p>After a long time, the ardent sound of applause erupted from the crowd.</p> 
 <p>Among the sects, a few people from the <em>jianghu</em> mustered up their courage to ask, “Then what about us? We can also leave if we are not guilty right?”</p> 
 <p>“Hmph.” Xue Yiqi’s gaze was stern and upright while his tone was unquestionable.</p> 
 <p>“Like these disciples, no one who has conspired with Xiao Zhengran can escape while for those who haven’t done anything wrong, neither would the yamen pursue this any further.”</p> 
 <p>“Remember, everyone is the Xuan Kingdom’s people. Everyone must abide by the Xuan Kingdom’s laws. The case of murdering someone for his property needs to be reported to the yamen and not settled in private. Regardless of whether you’re a normal person or a person of the <em>jianghu</em>, you are all the Xuan Kingdom’s civilians. If there are no special circumstances, there will also be no more conflicts between the <em>jianghu</em> and the court in the future.”</p>
