 <p><span>Chapter 103 Cloud Nine: In the Glory of the Emperor</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang, Chu Xiaoxiao and Chu Huaicai had just left the estate, stomping out in the middle of the gathering.</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang was fuming. "Those people have no respect for me at all!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Exactly! You are his Majesty's favourite princess - not even the Heir dares to disrespect you like that! None of those 'distinguished guests' are qualified to talk to you like that!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Xiaoxiao chimed in her agreements, but Chu Huaicai kept silent.</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang's anger did not die down. "I am going to lodge a complain against all of them, and their fathers, to Father! I will make them regret what they did today!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"All of them? Will his Majesty be able to remember all of the people from the gathering today?" Chu Xiaoxiao frowned, completely forgetting the fact that the princess was barred from interfering with matters of the state, even if she was doted upon by the Emperor. Chu Huaicai knew of that, but thought twice of bursting their bubble.</span></p>
 <p><span>"You're right, Father has been busy recently. Perhaps I should just complain about the person that irked me the most." Liu Shang sank deep into her thoughts, trying to determine which of the guests at the gathering had insulted her the most. "Feng Luodi! She is despicable!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Exactly! Feng Luodi is the most insulting of the bunch." Chu Xiaoxiao agreed with her. "She is the daughter of an official, yet she played a song together with those lowly zither artistes! How shameless can she be?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang narrowed her eyes. </span><i><span>She is the woman that Situ had snuck out with while he spurned my advances! She is but a lowly woman, the daughter of a random official in court; who gave her the right to be more well-liked than I was at the gathering?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Elder brother Huaicai." Liu Shang called out to Chu Huaicai.</span></p>
 <p><span>How may I be of service, my Princess?" Chu Huaicai smiled at Liu Shang. "I will gladly ease the burden on your mind."</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang smiled gracefully. "I heard that you'd requested for my hand in marriage? Xiaoxiao has told me of your proposal to Father."</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Huaicai glanced at Chu Xiaoxiao, who quickly looked away.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Indeed." Chu Huaicai admitted generously. "Huaicai has always admired you from afar, my Princess. I had approached his Majesty for your hand in marriage, fearing that you will reject me for my low birth. His Majesty had given me the opportunity to spend time with you; if you agree, I will make an official proposal for your hand."</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang smiled. "I understand your feelings, Elder Brother Huaicai. I am willing to marry you, but you must do something for me before that."</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Huaicai perked up at her words. "What will you have me do, my Princess?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Shang'er wants you to approach Father, telling him that you want to take Feng Luodi as your concubine." Liu Shang was smiling, but her eyes were filled with hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Huaicai was a little taken aback by her request. "Huaicai had promised his Majesty that he will never take another concubine if he gets your hand in marriage."</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Xiaoxiao was shocked by their conversation. </span><i><span>Are these two the people I've known my entire life?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"That is alright. I am the one who asked for you to take a concubine anyway; Father will definitely agree." Liu Shang laughed. "All I want is the royal decree from Father - the decree that will doom that woman for the rest of her life. Hmph! I'll teach her the difference between us."</span></p>
 <p><span>"A brilliant plan, my Princess." Chu Huaicai bowed his head, a sly smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Let's head back to the palace now; I can barely wait for it to happen."</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>"Heir of Huaiyang, can you take full responsibility of your words?" The Emperor was surprised by Chu Huaicai's request and anger laced his voice. "Have you forgotten about your request for Shang'er's hand in marriage?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Huaicai did not reply but merely looked at Princess Shangrong for help.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor followed his gaze and looked at his daughter, puzzled. "Is this your intention, Shang'er?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Shang'er walked towards the Emperor and held his hand. "Father, just say yes to Elder Brother Huaicai. He only has two lowly handmaidens in his household; Feng Luodi will be able to help with any needs at home if she becomes his concubine."</span></p>
 <p><span>"What about you, Shang'er?" The Emperor was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Father," Princess Shangrong continued, "just command Elder Brother Huaicai to take Feng Luodi as a concubine. I'll be able to stay and provide you company for a while longer, at least until Feng Luodi becomes Elder Brother Huaicai's concubine."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Are you being serious here?" Needless to say, the Emperor quickly caught onto what his daughter was doing. "Alright then. Of course Father will agree to your request." The Emperor smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span>"You may rise, Heir of Huaiyang."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Thank you, your Majesty." Chu Huaicai got to his feet and moved to the side of the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor turned to an attendant. "Summon Feng Luodi to the palace. It is only appropriate if I issue my decree directly to her."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Yes, your Majesty."</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor smiled at Princess Shangrong. "I've heard about this Feng Luodi before - the daughter of Chamberlain Feng, right? I'd intended for the 7th Prince to take her as a concubine, but things had to happen before it happened."</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>Of course, Feng Luodi had no idea about what was transpiring behind her back. Confused at her current situation, she stepped through the palace gates. </span><i><span>This is my second time in the palace, the first when I was here for Jianqiu's Chrysanthemum Appraisal Gathering. What is going to happen this time?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>She followed the attendant to the Imperial Study, bowing her head as she went in as per customs. Forcing herself to her knees despite her unwillingness as an educated woman of the 21st century, she greeted the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Feng Luodi humbly greets your Majesty. Long live your Majesty!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Rise." The Emperor's voice was without emotion.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Thank you, your Majesty." Feng Luodi kowtowed again as per customs and got to her feet. That was when she noticed Princess Shangrong and Chu Huaicai in the study along with her. The grin on the face of the princess unnerved her. </span><i><span>I never did offend her, did I?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"You have been summoned today for your marriage, Feng Luodi." The Emperor spoke calmly. "I command you to find an auspicious date for your marriage to the Heir of Huaiyang."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi froze. </span><i><span>What on earth is happening? Why am I wedded to the Heir of Huaiyang? </span></i><span>Feng Luodi could not wrap her head around what was happening. </span><i><span>I'd crossed paths with the man for a total of three times, and he had never so much as spared a glance at me before! This is definitely not because of any feelings for me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>The expression on the face of Princess Shangrong quickly gave it away.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>It must be Princess Shangrong! But why is she targeting me? How does she even know me? Was it because of the music gathering that day? But I didn't even offend her that day! Or is it because of the fact that I'm a close friend of Jianqiu, that she's doing this to get back at Jianqiu for what happened that day? No, that can't be it. The princess barely steps out of the palace; I'm sure she does not know about my friendship with Jianqiu.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>Wait a minute, I've met them even before the gathering! That day, by the river, it was them on the boat next to ours! Princess Shangrong had been looking at me with hatred in her eyes that day! But why? What did I ever do to her?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi snapped back to her senses with a nudge from the attendant, having forgotten to answer the Emperor. She took a deep breath and dropped to her knees with a sound 'plonk'. Her forehead smacked the cold tiles of the floor with a resounding 'thunk'.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your Majesty! Please pardon my inability to marry the Heir of Huaiyang." Her voice was quavering, but she mustered all the courage she had and spoke clearly. "My mother, the Commandery Princess of Yushan, is sickly because of my birth. I want to do what I can for her by her side. Please understand my filial piety and retract your decree, your Majesty!"</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor did not speak.</span></p>
 <p><span>Princess Shangrong snickered. "Feng Luodi, are you trying to disobey a royal decree? The punishment for that is the execution of you and your entire clan. The decree cannot be retracted, Feng Luodi. How will that reflect upon his Majesty?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Luodi was under the impression that your Majesty had summoned me today to discuss my marriage. The decree had yet to be issued; it is not yet official." Feng Luodi did not raise her head from the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Father has already spoken. The marriage is official, whether you want it or not." Once again, Princess Shangrong spoke up before the Emperor did.</span></p>
 <p><span>By now, the Emperor had already confirmed his suspicions that there was a feud between the two girls. "Why? Are you unsatisfied with my arrangement? Or do you find the Heir of Huaiyang undeserving of you as his concubine?" The Emperor did not seem angered by Feng Luodi's refusal.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi raised her head, looking at Chu Huaicai. "Your Highness, why do you intend to marry me?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Huaicai shrugged nonchalantly. "I guess I like you."</span></p>
 <p><span>"You do? I find it hard to see that." Feng Luodi replied and turned back to the Emperor. "Your Majesty, I am not questioning your arrangement, but it is as you can see: the Heir has no love for me. Your Majesty, you are the symbol of righteousness of the Xuan Kingdom and I am your civilian. Surely you do not want to decree an inappropriate marriage for me and cause yourself to be the subject of gossips amongst the citizens."</span></p>
 <p><span>"How dare you! Are you threatening Father?" Princess Shangrong cried out in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span>A voice echoed from outside the Imperial Study.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your Majesty, the Duke of Anping requests to meet."</span></p>
