 <p>Chapter 143 Burnt Ends: Outcome</p>
 <p>Situ and Feng Luodi sat waiting in his residence, time passing as Situ teased the uneasy Feng Luodi. Finally, Feng Luodi was influenced by Situ's confidence and composure, keeping her heart at rest as she slowly sipped her tea. Naturally, Situ's jokes fell short afterwards.</p>
 <p>Situ could only laugh helplessly at his plight. <em>Things are finally calm again; even if the road ahead is dangerous and filled with traps, we will bring about the bloom of flowers where we go.</em></p>
 <p>Noon slowly came about, and Feng Luodi saw the head steward, Xiang Bo, helping an old man walking towards Situ's pavilion. The old man walked slowly as his feet shuffled slowly along the way, but his face was bright and lively, bearing with him the usual geniality of old people and the slight ferocity of a warrior.</p>
 <p><em>His face bears an uncanny resemblance to…</em></p>
 <p>Feng Luodi spun around to look at Situ, just in time to see him get to his feet, a smile on his face. Situ quickly walked up to the man, Feng Luodi quickly following behind him.</p>
 <p>"Father!" Situ took the hand of Senior General Situ, the usually intimidating general melting into a filial son, the change shocking Situ.</p>
 <p>However, Senior General Situ's eyes found Feng Luodi and he smiled kindly, patting Situ's hands that supported him. "This must be Miss Feng, as Xiang Bo has mentioned repeatedly in his letters."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi suddenly felt as if she was meeting her future in-law. She quickly searched her brain for the right title to address the old man. "Blessings, General Situ." She curtsied.</p>
 <p>"Good, good indeed." Senior General Situ laughed heartily and patted Situ's hand, the two of them slowly moving towards the pavilion. Feng Luodi backed out of their way and stepped aside, fully intending to sneak away. A cough from Situ and Xiang Bo appeared in her path.</p>
 <p>"Please, Miss Feng. The old general had just come from the palace and has many things to say to you."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi took a deep breath and, putting on the most damsel-like smile she could muster, stepped into the pavilion. She glared at Situ before taking a seat in a corner of the pavilion, listening to the conversation between the other two.</p>
 <p>"It's just as you've predicted: the Heir has been removed from his position as the Heir, and is now imprisoned in the palace. But nobody dared to suggest the matter of reinstating a new Heir Apparent due to the anger of the Emperor."</p>
 <p>Situ's lips curved upwards into a smile. "The Emperor must be growing soft if he lets the prince stay in the palace for the rest of his life even after his indictment."</p>
 <p>"The Emperor is already displeased about the matter. Muye, your position would be more difficult in the future."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi's heart clenched as she heard the words. <em>If someone, as experienced as the old general, deems Situ's situation as precarious, it must be much worse than I actually predicted!</em></p>
 <p>"Ha!" Senior General Situ belted hearty laughter as he got to his feet, clapping a strong hand onto Situ's shoulder. "I shan't say any more; go and comfort that worried girl over there." He shot a teasing look at Feng Luodi before slowly wobbling away with the support of the head steward.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi stood up confusedly and slowly walked towards Situ. "Is Senior General Situ not staying? I'm sure the two of you have not seen in each in a long while; is he not going to spend more time with you?"</p>
 <p>Situ shook his head. "He can't stand being in Chang'an for a second longer than he absolutely has to be."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi rolled her eyes. "Then aren't you going to send him to the door? You are his son!"</p>
 <p>Situ turned to face her. "I have to obey the orders of my father: to comfort a certain worried girl."</p>
 <p>"Who's worried?" Feng Luodi glanced around theatrically. "Now that we already know the results, I'll be heading home." Feng Luodi turned to leave, but felt yanked backwards by her collar as she fell into an embrace.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi slapped away the hand at her waist, smiling. "Situ Muye."</p>
 <p>"Here."</p>
 <p>"General of the Northern Army."</p>
 <p>"Here."</p>
 <p>"Duke of Anping."</p>
 <p>"Here."</p>
 <p>"To hell with that 'here'!" Feng Luodi spun around to face him. "Aren't you supposed to be busy with all your official work? Go and do your duties! You have loads to do!"</p>
 <p>"There's Qingjia and my Covert Guards to handle everything. I'm not busy at all." Situ raised an eyebrow, tightening his other arm around Feng Luodi and bringing her closer.</p>
 <p>"I am so going to convince them to leave you!" Feng Luodi snorted. "What a bad employer you are! Making them do all the work you have to do, and you don't even pay them extra!"</p>
 <p>A cold and confident smile showed on Situ's face. "They wouldn't."</p>
 <p>"And neither would you." He added.</p>
 <p><em>I want to smack this guy right in the face! </em>Feng Luodi suddenly let out a beautiful smile. "Situ." Then she brought her heel down hard onto his toes.</p>
 <p>"Ssssssssss." Situ hissed in pain, barely keeping himself from clutching his feet.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi grinned as she spun around, heading out of the pavilion. The smile was genuine, but it quickly faded away.</p>
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
 <p>When Feng Luodi finally reached home, she was just in time to bump into Chamberlain Feng, who had just returned home from his duties in court. Feng Luodi stood stunned for a second before she croaked out a few words, her eyes locked onto the expressionless face of her father.</p>
 <p>"Welcome back, Father."</p>
 <p>Chamberlain Feng nodded. "Remember to bring someone with you the next time you go out." The Chamberlain turned and headed into the household.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi let out a sigh of relief and slowly walked back to her courtyard, where she was greeted by the sight the First Lady waiting for her beneath the tree in the yard. The First Lady saw Feng Luodi and waved her over, a slight smile on her lips.</p>
 <p>"Mother." Feng Luodi quickly walked closer and knelt by her mother's knee. In the entire kingdom, besides Situ and Qi Jianqiu, the First Lady was the one she felt the most apologetic and guilty towards. The warmth and love she'd received from the First Lady had burdened her heart, for she knew that they were feelings she would be unable to return and is doomed to betray.</p>
 <p>"Sit down." The First Lady gently lifted her and helped her onto the chair. "You seem to be much happier lately, Luodi. That sets my heart at ease."</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry for making you worry about me, Mother." Feng Luodi bowed her head apologetically.</p>
 <p>"But I'm here today to talk to you about you and your lover."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi blinked a few times, but did not reject the title given to Situ.</p>
 <p>"It might seem fine for the two of you to go on like that, and I know that you pay no attention to the gossips of others, but you father has no choice but to face these talks about you in court. It is not right of you to bring him such trouble, even though he says nothing of it.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi smiled unconsciously, knowing fully the truth behind her mother's words. However, it was exactly in her nature to care about nothing else but herself as she did in the 21st Century, but it was now that she had to care for the Feng household as well. <em>Mother is going to be on Situ's side for this as well; looks like that's one supporter less I have.</em></p>
 <p>"Yes, Mother. I will do as you say."</p>
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
 <p>After the talk with her mother, Feng Luodi did not visit Situ. However, she was quickly 'abducted' by a man on a horse right in front of Autumnal Ombre, the man paying no attention to her cries. Unfortunately, all Scarlet did was to hand to vats of good wine to Situ, who nodded gratefully at her and sped off on Whirlwind, Feng Luodi held between his arms.</p>
 <p>Only when they'd left the city walls did Feng Luodi manage to right herself. She glared at Situ. "You are so unreasonable!"</p>
 <p>Situ did not so much as glance at her. "You taught me that."</p>
 <p>"What?" Situ tugged on Situ's clothes, hard.</p>
 <p>"If you do that anymore, there'll be a hole, and more gossips are going to spread about us."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi froze in action and slowly retracted her hand. Casting her eyes in front of her, she realised that they were heading in the direction of <em>The Painting of Ten Miles.</em></p>
 <p>Situ glanced at the back of Feng Luodi's head. "I found out that I cannot leave decisions to you; all women love to overthink."</p>
 <p>"How overbearing." Feng Luodi's voice was soft.</p>
 <p>"You caused it yourself." Situ tugged on the reins and Whirlwind slowed to a trot.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi snorted, but quickly realised how childish the action was and sat up straight in the saddle again, pretending as if nothing happened.</p>
 <p>"You don't have to think about anything." Situ's voice was low as he spoke slowly. "I'll be here no matter what happens. All you have to do is to eat, drink, and have fun."</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi ruffled her hair. "And you'll be in charge of the fighting and the scheming? Sorry, that's not possible." She paused. "Don't belittle me; I don't need your protection, and neither will I give you any trouble."</p>
 <p>Situ dropped the reins from his hands and drew Feng Luodi into his embrace. "Why do you always have to put up such a strong front, Luodi?"</p>
