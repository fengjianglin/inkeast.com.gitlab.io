<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Winter gave way to spring. The shops on both sides of Chang’an City’s streets were embellished with brightly-coloured and glistening pink and white cyclamen flowers which signified the endless flow of customers. The entrances of large households were arranged with bright purple and white kalanchoe flowers while light yellow oriental paperbush peeked out from the top of the wall.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi walked towards the Jiang residence, carrying the dry flower petals Scarlet had basked in the sun in her hand. Beside her, Shangguan Yan looked around in wonder, finding everything in the city novel and interesting. Only now did Shangguan Yan resembled young lady of twenty years old and not a person of the <em>jianghu</em> who fiddles with swords and spears all day long.“Will Yiqi also come to visit that elder brother of yours today?”</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan noticed something amiss from Feng Luodi’s expression and questioned lightly. Feng Luodi had long figured out Shangguan Yan’s temperament and was not taken aback by the sudden question, an unnoticeable smile gracing her lips.</p> 
 <p>“Master Xue has been visiting every two days after Elder Brother’s illness worsened.”</p> 
 <p>“Oh oh.” Shangguan Yan nodded repeatedly. Her pupils which were as lustrous as the stars were filled with joy. No one would be able to guess that this was that mysterious and aloof sect leader of the Xiaoyao Sect.</p> 
 <p>Upon arriving at the Jiang Residence, the Clan Defenders at the entrance directly allowed Feng Luodi to enter. Lu Bo who had much fewer responsibilities now that Jiang Moyin had resigned from his position, had time to lead the two of them into Jiang Moyin’s courtyard.</p> 
 <p>In the months that they have not met, the once lofty, graceful and handsome man was already so gaunt that people could barely bear to look straight at him. His elegant brows were already no longer as gentle and natural as they were in the days of the past. The bright eyes which were once filled with vigour had dulled. However, the corner of his mouth still had a familiar smile. <em>He was supposed to be that graceful, charming and breathtaking Jiang Moyin.</em></p> 
 <p>She sighed inwardly but she could not reveal it on her countenance. That would make them more worried.</p> 
 <p>“Elder Brother, I brought some scented tea.”</p> 
 <p>The gentleman dressed in white was playing the zither under the vines of wisteria. Feng Luodi’s voice jerked him out of his reverie.</p> 
 <p>When Jiang Moyin turned his head back and saw Feng Luodi, the radiance that swiftly flitted across his eyes did not escape Shangguan Yan’s eyes. ShangguanYan covered her mouth quickly, concealing her emotions.</p> 
 <p>“Luodi, you’re back.” It was clearly a simple sentence yet it carried immense lamentation.</p> 
 <p>“I haven’t heard you play the zither for a long time. Would you play a piece for me?”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi cheerfully walked over and introduced Shangguan Yan to Jiang Moyin. “This is Miss Shangguan. I’m sure a certain someone had spoken of her before.”Jiang Moyin raised his eyebrows. When his gaze landed on Shangguan Yan whose attire seemed familiar, a smile spread through his face. “I am well acquainted with the graceful bearings of Miss Shangguan.”</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan did not even miss a step despite the teasing tone in his voice. She calmly sat down by the side, hinting that she would not disturb them from their discussion of the zither.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi was dressed in a scarlet blouse, the cherry-coloured robe that was draped across her shoulders lent her a hint of seductiveness. A few moments later, the small courtyard was awash with the light and resounding music, sometimes aking to that of a creek nestled deep in the mountains, and some reminiscent of the floating clouds in the skies. From time to time, it was like the sound of a cascade of water ramming into the cliff, grand and inspiring.</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan sighed involuntarily. Feng Luodi’s zither skills had already reached great heights and there were probably few in the world who could even be compared with her.</p> 
 <p><em>One can discern a person’s heart by listening to their music. At this moment, Feng Luodi’s mood is probably like the sound of her zither. Although it is sanguine and seemingly without restraint, it could barely conceal the worry and restlessness in her heart. Due to the hesitation about the future and imminent danger, as a woman who could only stay in her room, things have really been hard for her.</em> Shangguan Yan lamented in her heart. When her gaze landed on Jiang Moyin beside Feng Luodi, she was shocked by the deep feelings in his eyes that surged out fiercely. Shangguan Yan quickly turned her face away. Waves were raging in her heart due to her astonishment. This elder brother of Feng Luodi is actually harbouring such feelings!</p> 
 <p><em>Does that fierce and ruthless man know about this?</em> At this moment, Shangguan Yan really wanted to go forward and pull Feng Luodi away. However, she had no choice but to admit that she felt that when Feng Luodi and Situ stood together, they were incomparably matching while when she stood with this world number one gifted scholar, they were also very harmonious.</p> 
 <p>However, Shangguan Yan made a clear difference between her likes and dislikes. <em>Since Feng Luodi is already together with Situ Muye, there shouldn’t be a third person sticking his foot in their relationship. This Jiang Moyin appears to have no intention of sticking his foot in. Will there really be a person like that? A man that clearly loves a woman, yet letting the woman be together with someone else. Is it because he loves too deeply?</em></p> 
 <p><em>No.</em> Shangguan Yan shook her head. <em>Love has always been selfish. No one is an exception.</em></p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan noticed the slightly greenish hue of Jiang Moyin’s skin especially in the areas around his neck and fingers, and thought she understood something. Just when Shangguan Yan thought that she had discovered some important secret, Jiang Moyin suddenly turned around and gently made a sign with his fingers.</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan was a little embarrassed. At the same time, she was also fearful. <em>This person who has the look of a weak scholar seems to be surprisingly resilient.</em></p> 
 <p>A strange whistling sound could be heard from outside the courtyard. It was intermittent but had a very steady rhythm. Feng Luodi pressed on the zither strings, stopping the music. She exchanged a puzzled glance with Jiang Moyin and looked towards the outside of the courtyard. On the contrary, Shangguan Yan smiled in surprise. With one swift leap, she jumped flipped over the walls of the courtyard in a single motion.</p> 
 <p>“How convenient.” Feng Luodi involuntarily sighed. She did not even need to go through the entrance. She could go by the shortest path and save time.</p> 
 <p>Jiang Moyin only smiled. Hidden in his sleeves, he continuously clenched his fists tightly to force himself to stay awake.</p> 
 <p>Soon, Shangguan Yan jumped over the wall again, a man following close behind her. He was clad in a long white gown and dressed simply. He appeared cold and handsome and his slightly pursed thin lips looked a little stern. An exquisite jade xiao<a href="#footnote-7cfd">[1]</a> with black spots was clutched in his hand.</p> 
 <p><em>Was this the person who made that sound just now?</em> Feng Luodi looked at the jade xiao in the person’s hand in puzzlement.</p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan’s sounded delighted as she introduced the visitor to the two surprised people.</p> 
 <p>“This is the Eldritch Physician of our Xiaoyao Sect, Xia Jingfeng.”</p> 
 <p>When Feng Luodi heard this name, her almond eyes were instantly filled with hope. She directed her burning gaze at Xia Jingfeng.</p> 
 <p>“So you are the Eldritch Physician. Would it be possible to ask you to treat my elder brother?” She immediately blurted out in a rude tone without even considering.</p> 
 <p>Jiang Moyin was smiling on the outside but his eyes dimmed. <em>It is precisely because of this that I cannot say anything and cannot fight for anything. What can I do even if I refuse to accept my fate?</em></p> 
 <p>Shangguan Yan laughed, expressing that she understood why the usually indifferent Feng Luodi would be this excited. “I have spoken to Jingfeng about his condition. Now, he’ll have to evaluate the patient’s condition for himself.”</p> 
 <p>Xia Jingfeng nodded slightly with a coldness that emanated from deep within his bones. He slowly walked to Jiang Moyin’s side, his gaze never once landing on Feng Luodi.</p> 
 <p>In order to reassure Feng Luodi, Jiang Moyin who had once given up on treatment obediently sat down and extended his hand.</p> 
 <p>At this moment, Lu Bo hastily ran in and informed Jiang Moyin, “Master, Master Xue has just sent word to inform that he would not be coming today and that you should not wait for him.”</p> 
 <p>Jiang Moyin nodded slightly to express that he had received the message.</p> 
 <p>However, Shangguan Yan who had looked forward to this with all her heart was dissatisfied. She flung her sleeves and turned to Lu Bo. “Why is Yiqi not coming? Did something happen?”</p> 
 <p>Lu Bo was a little taken aback by the question. “It seems like there is someone causing a ruckus on the Northern Avenue. Being the Chief of the Palatial Guards, Master Xue has to handle the situation.”</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing that, Shangguan Yan’s eyebrows furrowed and her tone was unkind. ”Who is this insolent brat causing trouble at such a time?” She immediately sprung up and left.</p> 
 <p>Lu Bo was stupefied.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi expressed her helplessness at Shangguan Yan’s usual rash manner and did not comment further. Only after a while did she realise with a start. <em>With Shangguan Yan gone, who was going to be the middleman between Xia Jingfeng and them?</em></p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi’s expression became unfathomable for a split second.</p> 
 <p>After Xia Jingfeng took Jiang Moyin’s pulse, he did not say anything. He simply took out his needle pouch, extracted a few silver needles and started treatment without saying anything.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi and Lu Bo watched from the sides, filled with tension and anxiousness. <em>This person is really accurate and fierce in his actions.</em></p> 
 <p>A while later, and still without speaking a word, Xia Jingfeng began to take out other things from his bag.</p> 
 <p>Jiang Moyin suddenly coughed and his gaze subconsciously floated to Lu Bo by the side. With the chemistry built over the years between him and Jiang Moyin, Lu Bo instantly understood what he meant and softly spoke to the bewildered Feng Luodi beside him.</p> 
 <p>“Miss Feng, Master has picked a few gifts for you. Since we’re idle now, shall I lead you to check them out?”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi nodded and left obediently.</p> 
 <p>When only Jiang Moyin and Xia Jingfeng were left in the pavilion, Jiang Moyin smiled. “You need not waste your efforts on me anymore, Eldritch Doctor. I am aware that I don’t have much time left. I am sorry to have inconvenienced you by making a trip here.”</p> 
 <p>Xia Jingfeng languidly lifted his eyelids but his hands did not stop. “I only obey the words of our Sect Leader.”</p> 
 <p>Jiang Moyin smiled lightly and did not speak again.</p> 
 <p>Only after a while did Xia Jingfeng stop and speak slowly, “Even if you know, I still have to inform you about the results.”</p> 
 <p>As he raised his eyes, it was unclear as to whether he was smiling and his tone was also very solemn. “I am all ears, but please do not let Luodi know.”</p> 
 <p>It was unclear as to whether Xia Jingfeng had heard this sentence. He only minded his own business. “Based on the current condition of your body, you are lucky if you can live more than five months. Within one to three months, there will be signs that your time is almost up.”</p> 
 <p>Anyone who had received such news about their death would be full of sorrow, but when Xia Jingfeng looked at the man before him, all he saw was the same light smile on his lips and calmness in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>“If that’s the case, there aren’t many things I can do.” Jiang Moyin’s tone was slightly regretful. There wouldn’t be many more memories I can leave behind for her.</p> 
 <p>A deafening silence hung over the pavilion.</p> 
 <p>Twilight had fallen, but Shangguan Yan had yet to return. Hence, Feng Luodi and Xia Jingfeng bid goodbye to Jiang Moyin. Before they left, Jiang Moyin cast a meaningful look at Xia Jingfeng.</p> 
 <p>Xia Jingfeng still did not respond.</p> 
 <p><del>~~</del></p> 
 <p>The worn out birds began to return to their nests, the woods warm under the glow of the sunset. Smoke started to emit from the nearby houses and smiles were beaming on the faces of children. Everything was supposed to be that warm and comfortable, yet the silence of melancholy crept through the wind.</p> 
 <p>After leaving the Jiang residence, Xia Jingfeng detected the fluctuations in Feng Luodi’s mood but he simply kept mum. Yet, despite repressing it over and over again, she still could not refrain from asking, “Does he really only have five months left?”</p> 
 <p>Xia Jingfeng looked ahead. His sleeves made a sound as they rubbed together.</p> 
 <p>“As I thought, you were outside the courtyard.”</p> 
 <p>“As I thought, your martial arts ability is outstanding.” Feng Luodi wanted to tease him, but her voice was laden with sorrow. “Even you, the Eldritch Physician, have no solution at all?” Feng Luodi did not dare to raise her head to look at him, but merely plodded ahead, step by step.</p> 
 <p>An indescribable emotion crept into Xia Jingfeng’s heart. “Life and death is all fate, Miss. You should accept it and learn to look on the bright side.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi chuckled lightly, but it came out choked.</p> 
 <p>When they were able to see the Feng Residence’s entrance from far away, Xia Jingfeng stopped walking. His voice was still as distant as ever. “At least, I won’t let his condition deteriorate any further. I live in an inn located in Liu Jiao Alley. If something happens to him, you can send someone to relay a message to me.”</p> 
 <p>After he was done speaking, he did not wait for Feng Luodi to speak and simply vanished from the streets.</p>
