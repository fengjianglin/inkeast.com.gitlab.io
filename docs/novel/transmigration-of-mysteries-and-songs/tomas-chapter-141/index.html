 <p><span>Chapter 141 Burnt Ends: Traps</span></p>
 <p><span>As usual, Feng Luodi headed to the Duke's residence, bringing her zither with her as per Situ's request. She sat in the room, her fingers dancing deftly across the strings.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>A breeze of a thousand miles</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>Carrying my memories</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>The moon bright with tales of love</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>In the midst of the world</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>You laugh at romance</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>And turn to see the dying rays of dusk</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Her hand paused halfway mid-song.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Aren't you pretending to be 'sick'? Why are you asking the guards to lower the security, and who has ever heard of the sick listening to music?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ leaned casually against the headboard, his hands folded behind his head. "Melodies help the sick recover faster." Situ paused, and added nonchalantly. "You can see the effects on Moyin."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hmmm?" Feng Luodi was perplexed. "What does this have to do with elder brother? His health is too weak; there's nothing I can do for him." Feng Luodi was very disappointed in herself.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ was unmoved. "You'll be doing a great favour for all of us if you were to spend your days peacefully and calmly."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hey!" Feng Luodi's disappointment evaporated. "Why are you making it sound like I'm the one who's always causing problems?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Who's the one who's always in danger?"</span></p>
 <p><span>That shut Feng Luodi up immediately. The memories of Situ's 'heroic' deeds to save her from trouble came to mind. </span><i><span>Such nostalgic memories..</span></i></p>
 <p><span>A knock sounded on the door. "Your Highness, I'm here with tea."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi frowned, finding the voice unfamiliar. Her recent visits to Situ's room had gotten her acquainted with all the attendants that worked in the vicinity.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Do we let him come in?" Feng Luodi mouthed to Situ.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ nodded and sank deeper into the bed, hiding partially beneath the quilt. Feng Luodi walked forward and opened the door to see an unfamiliar attendant with a tray standing outside.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Please come in."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Thank you, Miss Feng." The attendant bowed, and Feng Luodi returned a smile. The attendant took out the snacks from the tray and poured tea from the pot, Feng Luodi watching his every move. He placed a cup of tea by the zither, but covered the cup with his sleeve as he poured another cup. Then, he held the cup in his hands and leaned forward to pass it to Situ.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi's face darkened as she grabbed the attendant's hand. "What did you put in the cup?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Of course, Feng Luodi did not see anything as it was well hidden by the attendant's sleeve, but her statement had thrown the attendant off-guard, making him think that he was already caught. In the bed, approval flashed through Situ's eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>The attendant's heart sank and he broke free of her grip, fishing out a dagger and lunging towards Situ. Remembering that Situ was supposed to be 'sick', Feng Luodi mustered her courage and grabbed the zither lying beside her, smashing it hard onto the attendant.</span></p>
 <p><span>The attendant was caught off guard, stunned from the sudden pain. Situ was surprised with the turn of events as well, wincing from his injuries as he could not help but smile.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>It's my turn to save him now! </span></i><span>Feng Luodi grabbed the pot of hot water from the tray and splashed it onto the attendant.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Sssssssss!"</span></p>
 <p><span>The attendant came back to his senses and turned his target to Feng Luodi, enraged and in pain. Naturally, Situ could not sit by and watch anymore. Plucking a bead off the drapes surrounding the bed and, with a flick of his hand, sent it flying through the air where it landed accurately on the attendant's acupuncture point, bringing him down.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi still had a stool in her hand and was waiting for the incoming attack from the attendant, surprised with the sudden change of events. She blinked and looked at Situ. "Was I that strong?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ smiled and waved her over. Feng Luodi put down the stool and sat down by the bed. Situ's words were simple. "And that's another time where I've saved you. I think I deserve a reward."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi blinked. "Hey! I'm the one who just saved you! Don't deny it!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ grinned. "Alright then, I'll give you a reward." He grabbed her into his arms and kissed deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was dizzy when she was finally released from the kiss, punching Situ hard on the leg to vent her frustration and embarrassment. "You and your feigned sickness!" She turned to the attendant on the floor. "What shall we do with him?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Oh." Situ got out of bed and put on an outer robe, snapping his fingers together deftly. Two entered the room swiftly, frowning when he saw the attendant on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span>"My apologies, General. I did not notice that someone has snuck in."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ shook his head. "The fault is not with you. I have something for you to do." He paused. "Send this man to the Eighth Prince; it's time we give him more resources to work with."</span></p>
 <p><span>Two nodded. "I understand."</span></p>
 <p><span>"And we can start spreading the news that I have regained consciousness, and am slowly recovering. Give them the chance for the last struggle. We do not have much time left."</span></p>
 <p><span>Two was serious. "I understand, General. I shall get to it immediately." Two exited the room with the attendant held under his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi looked at the tall man who had his back to her. </span><i><span>He has everything under control. Even if he's injured, he is still fully in control of the situation; those who work against him wouldn't even know how they die to his traps. It is such a scary thing to be his enemy.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>But it will be fortunate to have his support.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Only now did Feng Luodi understand why the Emperor had wanted to keep Situ in Chang'an so badly. If someone with Situ's capabilities was allowed to roam free where the Emperor could not observe clearly, he will soon be uncontrollable. </span><i><span>But I know that Situ has never allowed himself been controlled by anyone before.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>But what will his future be like? What will happen if I leave Chang'an? </span></i><span>These questions have plagued her mind ever since the day she'd promised to stay by Situ's side.</span></p>
 <p><span>"You're so lucky to have such a powerful group of Covert Guards working for you; all you need to do is to give commands." All her thoughts surmounted to these words.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I can give them to you." Situ turned to face her, his intense dark eyes making her uncomfortable. "Luodi, leave Chang'an for the time being. I'll bring you back when everything is clear."</span></p>
 <p><span>The unsettling feeling grew stronger. Feng Luodi did not reply but gave a wide grin instead. Now, she finally knew what she wanted. </span><i><span>If I am to die right now before I can return to my world, that wouldn't be too bad either. Well, it's not my choice to not return to my world, after all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"No."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Why are you looking so solemn?" Situ said helplessly as he walked closer to her. The unsettling feeling in her stomach disappeared. "Nobody will hurt you." Situ promised.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>But I'm scared that they will hurt you.</span></i><span> She hid that sentence in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span>Their eyes met in the air, and for a moment, the world was silent.</span></p>
 <p><span>Then a voice shattered the romantic atmosphere. "I don't care anymore, Situ! You have to help me this time! I don't want to be the Imperial Treasurer anymore!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Gan Qingjia?" Feng Luodi quickly struggled out of Situ's embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia entered to see Situ's cold expression, Feng Luodi standing by the desk. Both of them had their backs to each other.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia blinked and took a good look at Situ. "Did I interrupt something?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Cough, cough!" Feng Luodi choked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia quickly changed the topic. "You have to help me this time, Situ!" He reached forward, grabbed Situ by his arm and started dragging him out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Uhm, get dressed properly before you go out." Feng Luodi did not turn around.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia raised an eyebrow and shot a look at Situ, dressed in nothing but bedclothes and an outer robe. Situ calmly put on his clothes and headed out of the room with Gan Qingjia, grabbing Feng Luodi by the hand as he passed her.</span></p>
 <p><span>They came to the pavilion in the courtyard and sat down. "What is it?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia started his complaint. "I don't know how the previous Imperial Treasurer had done his job, but the entire bureau is a mess. None of the officials can get anything done!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Then just keep a selected few, and find a chance for the Emperor to fire all of them." Situ was unfazed.</span></p>
 <p><span>"What makes you think that his Majesty would listen to me?" Gan Qingjia did not buy it.</span></p>
 <p><span>"You're very popular with the Emperor right now," Situ stated a matter-of-factly, "you are the important one in his plans to reform the court."</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia rubbed his chin. "Now that you put it that way...I'm pretty damn good, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi mentally facepalmed. </span><i><span>No wonder Jianqiu will like him; the two are so alike in some areas.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Also, why does the Imperial Treasurer have so many things to take care of? Not only do I have to oversee the distribution of resources, I even have to keep track of the trades of iron, salt and even the tenure of lands! What is this!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ threw him a sideward glance. "Do you still want to get married?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Yes!" Gan Qingjia was frank.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Then do your job properly." Situ raised an eyebrow. "Or what are you going to propose with?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Well, that's a good reason for me to work hard." Gan Qingjia guffawed, but his face quickly changed. He lunged for Situ's neck, wanting to hold him in a playful choke. "You're not the one spending his days in the Bureau! You can feign sickness, but I can't!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi quickly stood up to come between the two of them. Gan Qingjia grinned wickedly as his eyes darted between the two of them. "Speaking of which, what are you going to propose with, Situ?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ's face changed as he quickly glanced at Feng Luodi, panic seizing his heart as he feared the worst.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi smiled, her eyes narrowing. "Did you tell Jianqiu before you visited the zither parlours?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia froze for a second and turned to run out of the courtyard. "Situ! I'll be borrowing your Assistant Generals for the time being!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi did not see the look on Situ's face.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>Meanwhile, in the Jiang residence.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin opened his eyes as he leaned against the pavilion in his courtyard. "Seems like the worst has happened." He murmured.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Do not worry, Master. We will always be in your service." A few men dressed in plain clothes approached the pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin closed his eyes again, sighing tiredly. "I see that none of you had joined his forces."</span></p>
 <p><span>The men exchanged a look and replied confidently in unison. "We are, and only will be, your followers."</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin smiled lightly. "Then let me entrust one last thing to you as Jiang Moyin: stop the Heir."</span></p>
 <p><span>"We will do our best."</span></p>
 <p><span>The courtyard descended into silence again after the departure of the men. The silence was deathly; even the wind did not seem to make a sound as it gently breezed through the courtyard. All that was left was the passage of time, and the cut-flower sound of a man waiting to die[1.Disclaimer: This beautiful phrase was stolen from <em>The Name of the Wind&nbsp;</em>by Patrick Rothfuss and I just had to steal it because it was so apt and beautiful!].</span></p>
 <p><span>"How can I make you stay, Luodi, when I have so much time left to call out to you like that."</span></p>
 <p><span>Outside the courtyard, Lu Bo stood watching his Master and made a decision. </span><i><span>The dealings in the darkness will have to surface one day; such things are never the way.</span></i></p>
