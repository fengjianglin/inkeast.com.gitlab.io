 <p><span>Chapter 144 Burnt Ends: Drunken Stupor</span></p>
 <p><span>At </span><i><span>The Painting of Ten Miles, </span></i><span>the handsome gentleman garbed in black clothes and the smiling damsel in green sat across from each other. Situ slapped open the seal on one of the vats and chugged a mouthful of wine, Feng Luodi watching him quietly. </span><i><span>His wet lips, his swallowing motion, the drops of wine lingering on the corner of his mouth...tantalising.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Her eyes darted away as Situ looked at her. </span><i><span>If this man was in the 21st Century, he'd probably be the most eligible bachelor in the world. Ever. Not to say that he isn't already a very popular man...</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Are you going to the Autumnal Feast?" Situ sat the wine down and motioned for Feng Luodi to move closer to him. She unwillingly obliged.</span></p>
 <p><span>"What Autumnal Feast?" Feng Luodi was still upset at how Situ had 'abducted' her right off the streets of the capital. </span><i><span>I can only imagine what is going to happen to me when Father hears of that...</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Situ patted her on the head. "On the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Emperor will host a banquet for all the officials and the families in the palace."</span></p>
 <p><span>"The very word 'banquet' brings bad such bad memories." Feng Luodi tore off the seal on the other vat of wine and set it aside. It was too strong for her to enjoy, but she liked the fragrance of the wine.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Shall we recall those memories again?" Situ asked on purpose.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi gave him a death stare. "Do it one more time and I will definitely punch you."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ shrugged. "It's not like your punches hurt."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi huffed in frustration and held the vat of wine to her lips, slowly slipping. Situ's gaze landed on her red lips.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Why does your vat of wine look better than mine?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi quickly scooted away from him. "Don't look at me like that! I know all the tricks in your book already!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ shrugged helplessly and took a sip from his own vat of wine. Perhaps it was due to her lack of drinking habits, memories and feelings welled up inside of Feng Luodi as she slowly sipped the wine. Her eyes took in the familiar beauty of </span><i><span>The Painting of Ten Miles, </span></i><span>but her heart was much different from when she'd come the other time with Jiang Moyin.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Things change as time passes, huh? What a true saying.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Are you still drinking that? It's really strong." Situ reminded gently.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi turned and glared at him, her eyes woozy from the alcohol. "Hey! Why can't I drink it, when you're drinking it as well?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ waved his hand, chuckling. "Alright, go ahead. I'll be sending you back anyway." The Situ of the past would have tried to stop Feng Luodi's thoughts from wandering, but now there was no need for that. The Feng Luodi of the past had seemed ephemeral, but now she was right next to him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Having gained Situ's permission, Feng Luodi quickly finished her wine and proceeded to snatch the vat of wine in front of Situ for herself. Situ sighed. </span><i><span>Is there anything sadder than being ignored by your girl, for the sake of wine?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>When Feng Luodi was finally done with the two vats of wine, dusk was already approaching. Situ called out to her. "Luodi, let's go. I'll send you back home."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi turned to look at him, her eyes hazy as she stretched her hands out towards him. "Hug."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ froze for a second, his brain unable to comprehend the Feng Luodi before him. This was the first time Feng Luodi had asked for his affection, even if under the influence of alcohol. Barely keeping his smile from his face, Situ scooped Feng Luodi into his arms and turned to head to his horse. Feng Luodi's arms circled his neck naturally.</span></p>
 <p><span>She leaned into his ear. "You're so slow."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ blinked. Feng Luodi was semi-conscious when they returned to Whirlwind, and Situ had no choice but to help her onto the horse, holding her between his arms. He draped his robe over her body before Whirlwind set off at a brisk trot. Feng Luodi was nuzzled in his embrace like a little girl, her hands gripping his clothes tightly. Her breath warmed his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span>It took all of Situ's mental strength to keep both of them from falling off the horse.</span></p>
 <p><span>The gates of Chang'an soon came into view and Whirlwind slowed to a trot, headed for the Feng residence. Feng Luodi suddenly turned towards Situ.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Let's not go back tonight. Father is at home; I'll be in trouble if I go home like that." Her words were slow but clear. For a moment, Situ thought that her stupor had been an act all along.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Where shall we go?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your place." Her hands still held onto him tightly. "I'm so sleepy..."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ remembered the spare room in his courtyard for Feng Luodi and turned the horse towards his residence. When they reached the Duke's residence, Feng Luodi let go of Situ to allow him to get off the horse, hiding her face in the folds of the robe that was draped over her shoulders. Situ quickly hopped off the horse and turned to carry Feng Luodi into his arms. The moment she was in his embrace, her arms casually fell around his neck again.</span></p>
 <p><span>For a brief moment, Situ felt as if the whole world was watching him. The attendants, the Covert Guards, and even the head steward all stared at the two of them, mouths agape. For the first time in his life, Situ felt exposed.</span></p>
 <p><span>"What happened to Miss Feng?" Xiang Bo was surprised and glad at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span>"She's tired; I'm sending her back to her room." Situ disappeared as quickly as he could.</span></p>
 <p><span>The head steward followed behind slowly. </span><i><span>I'm sure Miss Feng is willing to marry the Duke now! But...what if Miss Feng denies all of this ever happening when she wakes? What if the Duke angers her?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Situ gently set Feng Luodi on the bed, carefully tucking her under the blanket. As he turned to leave the room, a pair of hands reached out and held him in place instead. He turned to see Feng Luodi with her eyes wide open, her eyes clear as day.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I can't fall asleep. Stay and talk to me."</span></p>
 <p><span>It was the first time he'd heard her speak to him in such a soft and hushed tone. </span><i><span>This is...too many firsts for one day. I'm feeling more nervous than my first day on the battlefield! </span></i><span>The soft side of Feng Luodi was one that he'd never seen before, and it did not take long for him to move a stool to the side of the bed where he sat down, his eyes looking intently at the girl in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Now that's a good boy." Feng Luodi smiled. Her eyes seemed to drift off, but they quickly became clear again.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ could no longer tell if she was drunk. "Do I get a reward for being good?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Of course." Feng Luodi grabbed Situ and pulled him closer, pecking him on the cheek before he could react.</span></p>
 <p><span>For a brief moment, flowers bloomed inside Situ. He leaned in for more, but she quickly let go of him. Her hands landed on his as they explored each line and crack of his hands. Her small and nimble hands were warm and ticklish as they roamed across the hard calluses on his palms.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Situ." Feng Luodi's voice was soft. "Are you supporting the First Prince?"</span></p>
 <p><span>His eyes sharpened, but softened when he saw the clear look in her eyes. Surprise and joy quickly filled him. "Are you going to be on my side?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"What do you think?" Feng Luodi glared at him, but it was ineffective against the general in the heat of love.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ leaned closer. "Tell me with your actions."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi reached out an arm and snaked it around his neck, pulling his face closer. Their lips met.</span></p>
 <p><span>After a long and deep kiss, Feng Luodi leaned into his ear. "Why have you never asked me, where I am from?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Now Situ knew that Feng Luodi was drunk. That was her biggest secret, the one thing that she would never let him know. His words were firm and warm. "It doesn't matte, if I'm not letting you leave."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi buried her face in his neck and giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Situ, you're so silly."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Situ, you're doing it on purpose. That's too much."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ felt warm liquid run down the side of his neck as the tears of his beloved streaked across his skin. He wrapped his arms around her and hugged her tightly, resting his chin on her forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span>"If that's what you think, then stay by my side forever. You can exact your revenge however you want."</span></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly, Situ felt a pain on his neck and leaned away from her in surprise. The look on his face was the dumbest look she had seen of him. She pulled him in again and whispered in his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Situ Muye, I don't think I've told you this before."</span></p>
 <p><span>"I love you."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ was overwhelmed, the world fading out of existence. The three words echoed in his head and all he saw was the woman in front of him. Flowers blossomed in the bloodied world he had known, colours filling the places that were once lifeless and forlorn.</span></p>
 <p><span>He kissed her deeply, drawing the drapes around them.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>"Luodi! You've got to be on my side this time; Qingjia is too much!" Qi Jianqiu barged into Feng Luodi's courtyard, heading straight for Feng Luodi who was staring into space, sitting under the tree.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Feng Luodi did not react at all. Her eyes stared into the distance, as if her soul was in another place. Scarlet and Jet stood by helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hmmm?" Qi Jianqiu frowned, waving a hand in front of her friend in an attempt to exact a reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a while before Feng Luodi blinked, as if surprised to see Qi Jianqiu in her courtyard. "Jianqiu? When did you come in?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Qi Jianqiu pouted. "I've been standing here for quite some time now! What are you thinking about that has drawn your soul away?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi's face turned a bright red immediately. Qi Jianqiu looked at the two handmaidens, confused by her best friend.</span></p>
 <p><span>Scarlet shrugged helplessly. "Young miss has been like that ever since she'd come back yesterday."</span></p>
 <p><span>QI Jianqiu blinked and moved in to get a closer look at Feng Luodi. "It's only the start of Autumn; why are you wearing such a high collar?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Oh...uhm...uhm..." The usually witty Feng Luodi stammered.</span></p>
 <p><span>QI Jianqiu continued. "Feng Luodi, there's something different about you today."</span></p>
 <p><span>"What? Where?" Feng Luodi panicked.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hmmm." Qi Jianqiu thought for a moment. "You look like you're in heat." </span></p>
