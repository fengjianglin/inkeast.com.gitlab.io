 <p><span>Chapter 102 Cloud Nine: Quarrel</span></p>
 <p><span>As was known by many at the gathering, Qi Jianqiu could not play music at all. That said, the amount of time she'd spent in zither parlours, teahouses and the like made her a familiar face to the maestros of Chang'an. Compared to the relatively unknown Princess Shangrong who'd invited herself to the gathering, Qi Jianqiu was definitely a much more likeable person.</span></p>
 <p><span>Her statement was met with murmurs of agreement from some of the guests, while others merely sat in silence, waiting to observe the unfolding events. Jiang Moyin and Feng Luodi exchanged a look. </span><i><span>The princess would know very soon what a bad choice it is to garner such negative attention from Jianqiu.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang's eyes widened in anger and snorted derisively at Qi Jianqiu. "Well well well, look who's barking - the very sister of Concubine Yao! It's no wonder you're such an annoyance; you must've gotten it from your sister huh?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Qi Jianqiu's expression darkened. Her mother had died from an early age and her sister had stood in her place to take care of her ever since. In some ways, her sister was her weakness.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Actually, you're wrong." Qi Jianqiu shook her head mockingly. "Sisters do not inherit qualities from each other, princess; only mothers and daughters share their traits. It's just like a certain someone who'd arrived at this gathering without invitation - ignorant and full of herself."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi turned to Jiang Moyin quietly. "Do the two of them have a feud with each other? She'd never told me anything about it before."</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin raised a cup of tea to his lips. "Although the princess is favoured by the Emperor, her mother, Concubine Hui, is not. Meanwhile, Concubine Yao has been on the rise lately, receiving almost more attention than the Empress from the Emperor."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi shook her head, muddled by the complicated relationship between them. &nbsp;"This is so confusing…how is Jianqiu able to wrap her head around all of this, when she only has space in her brain for good food and beautiful girls?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin smiled. "Miss Qi is a simple person; I'm sure she's just irked by the ways of the princess."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi nodded along. "That's what I think as well. But you have to help her if the situation spirals out of control, elder brother!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin shook his head knowingly. "If it really comes down to that, I wouldn't be needed to defend her." Feng Luodi did not understand his comment, but her attention was quickly drawn to Chu Xiaoxiao, who shot to her feet in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span>She pointed an accusing finger at Qi Jianqiu. "Don't assume for a moment that you can be disrespectful to the princess just because of your looks, you hear me? You should feel honoured that the princess is even willing to grace you with her presence today. The princess decides who should play the zither, and she also decides who plays well."</span></p>
 <p><span>"My God…is this woman here to clown around?" Qi Jianqiu rolled her eyes and remarked offhandedly to Crystal. Crystal avoided her gaze and hid her smile. </span><i><span>Why is this Princess Shangrong and her friend such a…weirdo?"</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Chu Xiaoxiao shot a look at Liu Shang and, sensing her approval, continued smugly. "Perhaps some of you here can play a tune or two, but who on earth are you even inviting to this gathering of yours, Gentleman Fang? They are not fit to be here!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"May I ask what the issue is about, your Highness?" Gentleman Fang was visibly upset.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Xiaoxiao was oblivious to his anger. "Well, many of these guests are scholars of the arts or young masters from various distinguished families, but how are the lowly zither artistes invited to sit at the tables? How can you even allow their presence to taint the gathering?"</span></p>
 <p><span>She jabbed a finger in the direction of Feng Luodi. "What about this woman here? She is but a mere daughter of an unknown official in court - who let her into the estate? Her very presence brings down the quality of the entire gathering!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Qi Jianqiu narrowed her eyes and spat the words out of her mouth. "Hmph. I'm sure you're the one who's single-handedly destroying this well-reputed gathering."</span></p>
 <p><span>"What did you say?" Chu Xiaoxiao was fuming, angered that she'd been lectured in public. "This is no place for you to speak at all! You're just the daughter of another official, without any royal blood in your veins!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Qi Jianqiu was about to rebut, but Crystal held her back instead. "Relax; let others have a chance to speak as well."</span></p>
 <p><span>As expected, many others stood up against the princess and Chu Xiaoxiao as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I'd assumed that the gathering was so that the maestros of Chang'an could sit and enjoy music in each other's company. It doesn't matter if you can play or not; you just need to be ready to respect the gathering and the music played." A scholar stood up. "Your Highness, you are welcomed to leave the estate if you have no intention of respecting the gathering and our rules. If you wish to stay and abide by the rules, I'm sure we can have a very enjoyable night instead."</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Xiaoxiao was about to snap a reply in return, but other voices chimed in as well. The guests quickly comforted Gentleman Fang with their words, allaying the tension in the air. Under the masterful words of these people, the atmosphere quickly returned to an enjoyable one. After all, the guests rather spent their time proceeding with the gathering than arguing with the pompous Chu Xiaoxiao.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia smiled as he held up a snack to his lips, turning to Linglong. "Don't be mad that Jianqiu stole your limelight."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Why will I be?" Linglong covered her smile with an arm. "I'm just glad that you would be thinking for me."</span></p>
 <p><span>On the other side, Jiang Moyin smiled at Feng Luodi. "I'm surprised you didn't rise up to that bait."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi raised a brow at him and jabbed a finger at her temple. "There's definitely something wrong up there for her; I thought it best not to argue with someone like that."</span></p>
 <p><span>"HAHA HAHA!" Jiang Moyin roared in laughter, graceful as always despite his action. "That was brutal, Luodi." Feng Luodi did not reply, too busy nodding apologetically at the other guests who cast inquisitive looks at them. The crowd was surprised, having never seen Grand Tutor in such a state before.</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang's expression darkened. "Are you mocking me, Grand Tutor?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi glared at Jiang Moyin and murmured under her breath. "That's your reward for calling me brutal, hmph!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin did not even bother wiping the smile off his face. "Why would you even think that, princess? I did not even look your way today, much less mock you." Liu Shang's expression darkened further upon hearing his words, but Jiang Moyin paid no attention to her.</span></p>
 <p><span>He turned to Gentleman Fang. "My apologies for disrupting the gathering, Gentleman Fang. I was just too excited when Luodi told me that she was ready to play a song for us, in the spirit of the gathering. We can proceed with the gathering afterwards."</span></p>
 <p><span>Gentleman Fang stroked his beard idly as he laughed good-naturedly. "I had heard a lot about your expertise with the zither, Miss Feng. I was even worried that we wouldn't be able to enjoy your music if the cup had not landed in front of you, but now that you volunteer to play for us, my worries are laid to rest. Please, Miss Feng."</span></p>
 <p><span>Beside Feng Luodi, Gentleman Cen and Scholar Gao quickly nodded in agreement. "It would be our pleasure to hear you play, Miss Feng." The rest of the crowd chimed in their agreements as well, ignoring Princess Shangrong who was still glaring at Jiang Moyin.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although it'd felt good to be respected by the crowd, maintaining such a high profile was not in Feng Luodi's agenda. She rolled her eyes at Jiang Moyin. </span><i><span>Did you really have to push me into the spotlight like this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Qi Jianqiu nodded excitedly. "Luodi! Why don't you play the song Miss Crystal had just composed a while back? She can sing to the song as well!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Crystal nodded as well. "If you don't mind my intrusion, Miss Feng, I would gladly love to play a song with you."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Of course not, Miss Crystal. I would be pleased to perform with you." Feng Luodi smiled in return, ignoring the excited Qi Jianqiu beside Crystal.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Why don't we invite Miss Linglong to join in as well?" Gan Qingjia spoke up. "Then we'll have three damsels who are all maestros in their own right to perform together. That will definitely be an experience we can all boast about indeed!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Linglong nodded at the crowd and turned to smile at Feng Luodi. Qi Jianqiu pursed her lips, her dislike of Linglong apparent.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gentleman Fang answered on behalf of the crowd. "I never expected that I'll be graced with a performance of such talented damsels in my life. How kindly the fortunes have smiled upon me today!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi nodded at Linglong and Crystal respectively, a note ringing through the air as she started the song, the strings of the zither vibrating from her slender fingers. Crystal's melodious voice joined in, as did the accompaniment from Linglong.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>The rain cast a veil</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>The thunders a clap</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>I lean by the pavilion</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>Music beneath my fingertips</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>A single lotus marks a new season.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>The world flourishes</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>The boat floats down the river</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>Waves gently pat the shores</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>As my heart clears</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>My unrequited love in vain</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>The drums of dusk sound</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>The fishermen sing of home</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>Moonlight rises from the West</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>And the stars shine through the clouds</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>The flickering candle masks my feelings</span></i></p>
 <p><span>The crowd was enchanted by the song, unable to remove themselves from the melancholic picture painted by the bewitching melody and lyrics. Liu Shang had left in the middle of the song, upset with the lack of attention she was getting.</span></p>
 <p><span>The gathering ended soon enough, and the guests bid their farewell to Gentleman Fang. Qi Jianqiu returned home in her carriage, while Gan Qingjia dragged Xue Yiqi to send Linglong and Crystal back to their respective zither parlours. Naturally, it was up to Jiang Moyin to send Feng Luodi home. Of course, a few of the other guests at the gathering had offered their services, but Jiang Moyin rejected them skilfully.</span></p>
 <p><span>The carriage quickly arrived at the Feng Household. Feng Luodi alighted from the carriage and smiled at Jiang Moyin. "Rest early today, elder brother. It was really humid by the stream, and you'd spent an entire afternoon by it; I fear for your health."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your music alone was worth the stay. It's been some time since I'd heard you play." Jiang Moyin smiled, his clothes billowing around his overly slender figure.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi shook her head and laughed. "You can't get enough of poking fun at me, can you? I'll be going back now, be careful on your way back, elder brother."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Of course." Jiang Moyin nodded. "Go on in."</span></p>
 <p><span>As soon as Feng Luodi disappeared into the household, Jiang Moyin doubled over in pain, his frame wrecked by heaving coughs. When he removed his hand from his mouth, blood had pooled in his palm. An attendant stepped forward quickly, worried.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Are you alright, Grand Tutor? Let's head back now; the physician is waiting for you."</span></p>
 <p><span>"I'll be fine." Jiang Moyin boarded the carriage with the help of the attendant. "Run a check on the Heir of Huaiyang. I want to know who he has been interacting with since coming to Chang'an, and if they noticed anything wrong about him. Compile everything that can be found about him and send it to my study."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Yes, Grand Tutor."</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>Unbeknownst to Jiang Moyin, the Feng household received a royal decree as soon as he'd left the gates: Feng Luodi was summoned to the palace by the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Would you happen to know why the Emperor intends to meet me?" Feng Luodi was confused. </span><i><span>Why will the Emperor summon me out of nowhere? Father is not at home, and Mother is resting. Who can I discuss this with?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"I have no idea, but the Emperor must have a use for you. Please come along with me, Miss Feng."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Alright. Please lead the way." There was no time for Feng Luodi to ponder over the situation. She could only hope for the best, and prepare for the worst."</span></p>
