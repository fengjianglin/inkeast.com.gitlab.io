 <p>Chapter 154 Green Vines: Cooperation</p>
 <p><span>In the antechamber of the yamen, Governor Tian sat in the principal seat, while Situ and the First Prince sat flanking him while the remaining assistant county magistrates and police commissioners sat scattered in random seats around the antechamber.&nbsp;</span><span>The assistant county magistrates and police commissioners looked at each other in dismay as Governor Tian introduced Situ and the First Prince. They were aware that the court would dispatch specialised officials to attend to the case but they did not expect the arrival of these two high-ranking officials, an imperial prince and a duke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ’s expression was cold while the lips of the First Prince carried a faint smile. They were like a scene of winter and spring interweaving with one another. Everyone felt that they were in extreme agony.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Silence.</span></p>
 <p><span>Silence.</span></p>
 <p><span>The silence was deafening.</span></p>
 <p><span>Governor Tian had bashful look on his countenance and did not put on any airs as he addressed them, “Everyone, you need not be troubled. Now that the special envoys sent by His Majesty have arrived, we will be able to get to the bottom of this case very soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Immediately, voices of dissent arose again.</span></p>
 <p><span>“That Lu Buping from the Demonic Sect is the murderer. You just have to dispatch someone to arrest him!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Governor Tian glanced at Situ and First Prince who looked very composed and tactfully waved his hand. “He is only a suspect. At most, we will ask him to come to the yamen to cooperate with the investigation. We can’t simply send someone to capture him.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hmph,” someone immediately ridiculed his words, “Governor, don’t tell me you’re scared of the Demonic Sect? If a mere Lu Buping could easily intrude into the various large yamens and murder the county magistrates, he can also easily barge into here and kill you right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Governor Tian’s expression changed but he still put on a very meek and even weak appearance. “We shouldn’t utter such things without basis. This matter has nothing to do with Lu Buping. It’s not good to involve the Demonic Sect as we please.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>That person mocked him again. “Governor, it’s obvious that you’re just scared of the Demonic Sect. Even if the yamen can’t quell the Demonic Sect, isn’t there still the Central Army stationed in Xiang Yang Province? There are 200 000 troops. Every one of them is valiant and skilled in warfare. With them around, what is a mere Demonic Sect? Even if we want to control the whole Jianghu…”</span></p>
 <p><span>Before he could finish his words, he was interrupted by the shattering sound of a cup smashing onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone looked at the water stain and broken fragments on the floor in surprise. Then, they looked towards Situ and the First Prince. They were the only ones who dared to do something like this.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ’s expression was like the Grim Reaper of the Night, piercingly cold like the biting wind while his gaze that landed on them were like sharp blades that cut them until it was excruciatingly painful.</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince who was sitting beside Situ still carried a smile which was as gentle as the willow in the spring breeze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince said gently, “Does everyone know who the Central Army receives orders from? It is His Majesty. Do you know what the Central Army is for? It’s for protecting the nation and ensuring peace in our country. Right now, everyone wants to let the Central Army confront the Demonic Sect just for a Lu Buping who&nbsp;</span><em><span>might</span></em><span>&nbsp;be a murderer? I wonder how everyone obtained your current posts?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>His voice was soft, light and gentle. Yet it was like a knife which pierced into everyone’s hearts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The antechamber fell silent with his words. Governor Tian could only force an awkward smile on his face in an attempt to defuse the situation. Everyone became silent for a while and Governor Tian had no choice but to deride them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Only after quite a long while did an advisor addressed First Prince deferentially, “May I ask if Your Highness has any good suggestions? Right now, every county has already become very chaotic. If we are still unable to catch the culprit, I’m afraid that the commoners will have complaints.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince glanced at how that person looked like and asked, “I wonder where the assistant county magistrates from the respective counties are?”</span></p>
 <p><span>His tone revealed a type of stateliness which made everyone felt pressured.</span></p>
 <p><span>Immediately, fifteen people stood up. “Your subordinates are here.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I order you all to temporarily take over the position and duties of the County Magistrate and manage your own subordinates, the police commissioners, properly. The priority is to pacify the commoners. Next, we are to reorganize the government affairs in the province with the aim of letting the people lead peaceful lives.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>This was the courage and resolution of a leader.</span></p>
 <p><span>The fifteen assistant county magistrates immediately assented loudly, “I obey.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>First Prince smiled. It was insipid yet concealed a sense of oppression in it. “As for the matter of the culprit behind the killing of the county magistrates, I will look into it myself. I promise that within a month, I will ferret out the murderer. Therefore, I need everyone to cooperate with me and not act rashly by yourselves, otherwise…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince stopped.&nbsp;</span><span>Situ continued for him. His voice was so icy cold that it could seep into the bones. “You will be dealt with according to the military law.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Many faces turned pale. Especially Governor Tian, everyone also realized that the two leaders had intentionally let them make such a ruckus today. Then, they reminded the rest of their position in the investigation with the open display of power.</span></p>
 <p><span>There was nothing the officials could do about it. Situ was the General-in-chief of the Northern Army and had made heroic contributions to the Xuan Kingdom by his distinguished battle achievements while Li Buhui, the General-in-chief of the Central Army, was once the Rear General of the Central Army. As for this First Prince who was not a well-known figure, although he had no power, he was a ruthless character behind a gentle appearance and his smile intimidated them. He was also definitely not an ordinary person. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Officials gradually pledged allegiance one after another but First Prince remained indifferent while Governor Tian wiped the sweat on his forehead repeatedly. Deep in his eyes were bewilderment and panic.&nbsp;</span><em><span>The way things progressed is already beyond his expectations. The two people in front of him are both wise people.</span></em> <em><span>How is he still going to quickly settle this case so that His Majesty won’t reproach him for slacking off in his work?</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Only then did the First Prince raise his teacup and drank a mouthful of tea. At this moment, an officer of the yamen came running into the antechamber, panic apparent on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Things aren’t good. The people have congregated outside the yamen. They heard that special ambassadors have come from Chang’an and are clamouring for the perpetrator to be quickly captured! Otherwise, they will not leave until we have done so.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince knitted his eyebrows in an almost undetectable manner. Governor Tian concealed an expression of delight which flickered past his eyes. A few police commissioners who were very rash stood up and wanted to go outside. They were even bawling, “How dare these unruly commoners dictate how the yamen do things! Someone needs to sort them out.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>A few assistant county magistrates quickly stopped them and coughed lightly, but they looked towards the First Prince and Situ.</span></p>
 <p><span>When the few police commissioners looked over, their expressions immediately became awkward; neither retreating nor proceeding was an option.</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince took a moment to enjoy the look of discomfort on their faces before he spoke up, enunciating every word clearly, “All of you head back to your counties right away. I will take care of the situation here.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The few dozens of people hastily obeyed and the official of the yamen led them to the side door, from which they quickly left.</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince and Situ stood up and headed out of the door. Governor Tian followed and advised, “Your Highness, the&nbsp;</span><em><span>Jianghu&nbsp;</span></em><span>and the court have had feelings of animosity between each other all along. The commoners must have figured out this and that’s why they’re so unbridled. Your Highness, why not have me dispatch people to bring Lu Buping back?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Governor Tian looked at the First Prince’s expression cautiously.</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince smiled as he waved his hand. “No rush. Let me have a chat with the commoners before we do anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ walked to the courtyard and stopped in his tracks, turning to the First Prince, “In that case, I won’t go and witness how eloquent Your Highness will be.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>As the First Prince looked at Feng Luodi who was gracefully standing under the large tree, he laughed mischievously and headed outside. Governor Tian also saw Feng Luodi and nodded at her without putting on the airs of a Subsidiary Second Rank Official and caught up to the First Prince.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ walked towards Feng Luodi and reached out his hand to brush away the leaf in her hair. He suggested softly, “Let’s go out to take a walk?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi nodded and held her hand out. Situ’s lips turned upwards and took her hands into his wide sleeves. The two walked shoulder by shoulder as they as they explored Ding Tao, a region not any less prosperous than that of Jiang Nan.</span></p>
 <p><span>Hence, while First Prince was impatiently placating the commoners in front of the yamen, his good brother was strolling along the streets with a young lady by his side.&nbsp;</span><span>Perhaps it was the appearance of the First Prince when he entered Ding Tao Province with great fanfare which calmed the hearts of the people, many shops on the streets reopened for business and there were also more passers-by on the streets. Many people still had a troubled expression on their faces but there were more conversations made.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ and Feng Luodi chatted as they toured the streets.</span></p>
 <p><span>“In other words, you suspect that there’s a problem with that Governor Tian?” Feng Luodi asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ nodded. “Usually, in places where there are many people from the Jianghu, it is the hardest to be a governor. Those that can hold onto their positions are all capable men. Governor Tian has sat on his position steadily for the past ten years, so he is definitely not an ordinary person. The more he appears to be fearful and powerless about this matter, the more suspicious he is.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ spoke more when talking to Feng Luodi. “On top of that, Governor Tian advised us to capture that Demonic Sect’s Lu Buping so eagerly. That makes it seem more like he is up to something. Of course, it could also be possible that he is deliberately putting on such an appearance and the objective is to lure the Demonic Sect out.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi only half understood as she nodded. “This is to say that Governor Tian is indeed very suspicious. But what is his purpose in doing this?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ shook his head. “This needs more investigation. Let’s eat first.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ stopped walking, and Feng Luodi raised her head to take a look. They were outside a restaurant named ‘Floating Clouds Pavilion’. They could faintly hear the voices of young ladies singing from inside. They presumed that it was from women making a living by singing in the restaurant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi followed him to the second floor. Only after the attendant from the shop led them to their seats did Feng Luodi turn to Situ.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Then what is his Highness going to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ raised his head and glanced at Feng Luodi with a strange expression. “He's at such an age already. If he’s hungry, he knows how to find food.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was speechless. Sometimes, she felt that Situ was very respectful towards the First Prince and it was not at all like how he would treat a good friend while sometimes, he was very casual as if he was treating him like a normal person.&nbsp;</span><span>Situ did not pay attention to Feng Luodi’s puzzlement and read out the names of the dishes in an indifferent tone. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ten Thousand Word Braised Meat</span><span>, Saute Bean Curd</span><span>, Eight Treasure Gourd Duck</span><span>, Cattail Rhizome in Milk Soup,</span><span>&nbsp;Six Harmony and Chatang</span><span>.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi propped up her chin and silently looked at Situ as he ordered the dishes.&nbsp;</span><em><span>Window shopping with Situ, having a meal together and looking at him ordering the dishes is just like how boyfriends and girlfriends spend time with each other in the 21st century. This kind of feeling is wonderful.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>The attendant poured tea for the two of them and left. Situ looked at Feng Luodi and noticed that although her line of vision was on him, her thoughts were very far away.&nbsp;</span><em><span>Just like how she is so far away.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>His heart stirred. Taking advantage of his long arms, Situ stretched out his hand from one end of the table to the other end to take her hand into his own. He frowned. “Why is your hand so cold?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Is it?” Feng Luodi wanted to press her other hand to her face to feel but it was snatched out of the air by Situ. Only now did she discover that Situ’s hand was very big. It was big enough to envelop her hand in it.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What are you doing?” Feng Luodi could not suppress the heat rising in her face and glared at Situ who was calm and at ease.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ replied very innocently, “Helping you to warm your hands."</span></p>
 <p><span>Those few words successfully caused Feng Luodi to blush just like when she drank too much wine. As Situ looked at her, a deep and serene smile flickered at the bottom of his eyes. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“When will you be willing to stay with me in my residence?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The heat on Feng Luodi’s face immediately subsided. At first, she thought that Situ was referring to their marriage but she immediately recalled that he had clearly expressed that he would make no mention about this matter and knew that what he was talking about something else.&nbsp;</span><em><span>Staying in his residence...what else could this mean?</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Seeing Feng Luodi’s puzzled expression, Situ calmly smiled. “Sleep together.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi eyes widened instantly and looked around wildly at the customers at the few surrounding tables. Only when she realised that no one had overheard their conversation did she fiercely pinch Situ’s hand. “You’re crazy. Saying something like this in broad daylight?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ put on an innocent expression once again. “They are my innermost feelings.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi could not resist such expressions from the man before her. She was inwardly very certain that it was Gan Qingjia who taught Situ such tricks and she could not help but curse him under her breath. Feng Luodi wanted to break free of Situ’s hand but, it was futile no matter how she struggled. Suddenly, the weeping sound of a woman and the sound of a man cursing could be heard from a few tables away.</span></p>

 <p>Hey there again! :) This was the first chapter I translated after joining the team hehe. From then on, I translated close to 40 chapters until almost the end of the novel. XD</p>
 <p>I know some of you may like food pictures, so here they are! I think they got lost when we moved from the old website so I copy and pasted at the bottom of the chapter. &gt;&lt;</p>
