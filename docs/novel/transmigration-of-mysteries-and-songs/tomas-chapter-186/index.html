<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Duke of Anping’s Residence.</p> 
 <p>It was midsummer and the weather was scorching hot.</p> 
 <p>The Duke of Anping's Residence’s training ground was surrounded by people. Their general was still donned in armour with a <a href="https://i2.kknews.cc/SIG=1q9jk8b/p130008po8q218950q3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hong Ming Scimitar</a> in his hand. As he practised sparring with others, his swordplay remained unrestrained and focused, like he was cutting through mountains and rivers. His every move was as powerful as a thunderbolt, so the others didn’t dare to belittle him.</p> 
 <p>Situ switched opponent over and over again. Every single one of them ashamed and perspiring profusely as they were substituted. On the other hand, although Situ was breaking out in a sweat, the fierce look on his face didn’t diminish. His sharp eyes, pursed lips and increasingly fierce moves revealed his current mood.</p> 
 <p>The soldiers, who were standing at one side, watched him in awe. They respected and feared their general. From how things looked now, it felt as if their general had returned to how he was a few years ago, bathed in blood as he fought valiantly with no shred of mercy. He was callous and cruel, but he’d protected the nation’s territory and deployed troops adeptly, instilling fear in the enemy troops.</p> 
 <p>Not afar, Ji Buhui sighed when he witnessed this scene. He looked at Gan Qingjia beside him and asked, “He’s been like this since he left the court assembly. What happened during the court assembly again?”</p> 
 <p>Ji Buhui was older than Gan Qingjia by a few years and was used to the scenes of slaughter on the battlefield. After returning to the peaceful Chang’an, he was helpless when faced with all the schemes and machinations. He felt apathetic towards the officials who put on a facade every day with a smile plastered on their face, while scheming behind others’ backs. The only person he acknowledged was this young Imperial Treasurer.</p> 
 <p>He appeared flirtatious on the surface but he could, in fact, solve many conundrums by simply talking and laughing. While enjoying life, he handled the matters in court very well. <em>This kind of person is hard to come by. That’s why they say that their general has the most discerning eye for people.</em></p> 
 <p>Gan Qingjia sighed almost inaudibly.</p> 
 <p>“His Majesty had requested for Situ to set off for the deserts of the North three days later to patrol the borders.”</p> 
 <p>Ji Buhui furrowed, laying bare the viciousness in the recesses of his eyes.</p> 
 <p>“But isn’t Miss Feng going to be decapitated three days later? His Majesty is intentionally coercing General.”</p> 
 <p>“Exactly!”</p> 
 <p>Gan Qingjia rubbed the space between his eyebrows in vexation. <em>He has been keeping Jianqiu in the dark about Feng Luodi being sent to prison. But judging by the current state of affairs, Situ will ultimately be left with one choice. Once he steps on that path, there's no going back.</em></p> 
 <p>“The news about Feng Luodi going on a hunger strike was also spread according to His Majesty’s instructions. Based on that young lady’s temperament, she’s definitely capable of doing something like this to alleviate the burden on Situ’s shoulders. But, doing so was equivalent to thrusting a sword into Situ’s heart.”</p> 
 <p><em>One was unyielding while the other obstinate. It was precisely the outcome His Majesty wishes to see.</em> When Gan Qingjia thought about the Emperor, coldness emerged in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>According to his spies, the Emperor actually used Concubine Yao in his schemes. Logically speaking, she should be showered with greater honour and favour after giving birth to an imperial child. However, the Emperor was giving her the cold shoulders at this critical juncture. <em>His aim was to warn the Minister of the Right.</em></p> 
 <p><em>In the past, he married Concubine Yao to set the Minister of the Right’s mind at ease. Now, he was threatening him instead. As expected, emperors are heartless. They could stoop so low as to exploit their partners and their closest flesh and blood. Will there be a day where that gentle and benevolent First Prince will become like this? The desire for power can control one’s heart.</em></p> 
 <p>The more Gan Qingjia thought about it, the more he strayed away from the main topic. There had been too many issues recently and he was very exhausted. However, Xue Yiqi still hadn’t returned to Chang’an. <em>They are all fighting their own battles, none of them are allowed to collapse.</em></p> 
 <p>“Chamberlain Feng has returned from Yu Zhang, right? Didn’t His Majesty give that Commandery Prince of Yu Zhang some face?”</p> 
 <p>Ji Buhui suddenly recalled that Chamberlain Feng had returned not long ago.</p> 
 <p>Gan Qingjia pressed his eyebrows, trying to suppress his anger.</p> 
 <p>“He’s back, but His Majesty casually sent the Commandery Prince of Yu Zhang away. The Commandery Prince is currently pent up with anger but that supreme person is His Majesty after all. Everyone is helpless.”</p> 
 <p>“This is like the last straw of hope for General.”</p> 
 <p>Ji Buhui sighed. Suddenly, he turned his head and looked at Gan Qingjia with a solemn expression.</p> 
 <p>“Imperial Treasure, no matter what, I don’t wish for General to walk down that path. Although he is loyal in his heart, the people’s words are what will circulate for hundreds of years. I don’t wish for such a thing to happen.”</p> 
 <p>“I’m of the same opinion as you.”</p> 
 <p>Gan Qingjia had on a serious expression as he said this, but it soon turned into one of helplessness.</p> 
 <p>“But you also know Situ’s personality. He won’t put up with this. The fact that he’d stayed alone until now is sufficient to prove his resolve. He has finally managed to meet someone he can confide in, someone who is willing to accompany him. How can he let go so easily?”</p> 
 <p>“The flourishing world is transient like fireworks while human feelings are the most unpredictable. Emotions can make one who initially wants to die, live again for the sake of their beloved, and also let those who want to live, die of depression when they encounter something bad in life. It is a poison but also a medicine that saves people’s lives. You and I needn’t say no more.”</p> 
 <p>Ji Buhui was silent for a while before he unhurriedly said, “I agree with what you’ve said. I have seen through the General’s feelings these few days. But will Miss Feng really stay by the General’s side?”</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?”</p> 
 <p>Gan Qingjia suddenly turned his head to look at Ji Buhui.</p> 
 <p>Ji Buhui’s steady expression revealed some traces of hesitation.</p> 
 <p>“Perhaps it’s my misconception. Miss Feng gives me an unfathomable feeling, as if she could swiftly disappear any moment. But, when I think about it again, she’s merely an ordinary daughter of an eminent family. There’s nothing strange about that.”</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing this, Gan Qingjia sunk in thought. <em>An ordinary daughter of an eminent family wouldn’t act in such a peculiar manner and an ordinary person wouldn’t stay composed when encountering such incidents. This Feng Luodi is indeed a little strange.</em></p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Meanwhile, at the Feng Residence.</p> 
 <p>The First Lady saw her father, Commandery Prince of Yu Zhang, who she hadn’t seen in many years. Tears welled up in her eyes and she choked with sobs when she was about to speak. She actually felt like she was on the verge of collapsing.</p> 
 <p>The Commandery Prince sighed. After pacifying her, he teased the adorable one-year-old Feng Fuyou.</p> 
 <p>Chamberlain Feng, First Lady, Second Lady, Feng Fuyou and the Commandery Prince sat at the huge dining table. The only person missing was the indifferent Feng Luodi.</p> 
 <p>After Feng Fuyou babbled a few times, he called out, “Sister.”</p> 
 <p>Everyone was naturally delighted when he spoke, as for the person he called…</p> 
 <p>The Second Lady suddenly said in puzzlement, “Come to think of it, Luodi hasn’t returned to the residence for many days. What has she been busy with such that she had to stay in the villa outside of the city for so long?”</p> 
 <p>After calming down, the First Lady also came back to her senses. She cast a glance at Chamberlain Feng and then shifted her gaze to her father, who was sighing. The premonition she felt in her heart grew even stronger and she muttered, “Could it be that something has happened to Luodi? My Lord, are you hiding something from me?”</p> 
 <p>Chamberlain Feng furrowed. He was put in a difficult spot now. <em>The First Lady had been treated by the Eldritch Physician, Xia Jingfeng, such that she had almost recovered from her old ailment. She only had to recuperate now and she would have no problems living until seventy or eighty years old. No matter what, he couldn’t tell her what had happened to Feng Luodi.</em></p> 
 <p>“Madam, you worry too much. Luodi is fond of playing and she has probably forgotten about returning home since she’s living such an unfettered lifestyle at the villa. Let her play around for a few more days; I’ll get people to bring her back later. You don’t have to worry.”</p> 
 <p>The First Lady shook her head upon hearing this.</p> 
 <p>“I know Luodi the best. She’s not fond of playing at all. Furthermore, why did you settle the maidservants and pages in her courtyard somewhere else and you don’t even allow me to meet them. Are you doing this because they know something?”</p> 
 <p>Chamberlain Feng sighed. The wife he married was too intelligent. This also meant that he couldn’t have any secrets.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Meanwhile, at the Gan Residence.</p> 
 <p>Qi Jianqiu was sitting in her room expressionlessly.</p> 
 <p>There was hardly any tea left on the table. A few maidservants stood far away at a side and didn’t dare to move any closer. They never thought that the usually amiable-looking Madam could put on such a solemn expression. Her current appearance made them a little worried about Gan Qingjia, who was about to reach home.</p> 
 <p>Although this couple often bickered with one another, they could tell that this was a covert form of flirtatious banter, which made them envious rather than worried. However, this time, it was different.</p> 
 <p>When Gan Qingjia walked into the room, he immediately sensed that something was wrong.</p> 
 <p>Usually, at this hour, Qi Jianqiu would either be talking and laughing with a few maidservants or discussing new dishes and recent changes in Chang’an with them. When he kept her in the dark about Feng Luodi’s imprisonment, she had also continued life as usual. However, today, she seemed different.</p> 
 <p>Gan Qingjia already had a rough guess in his heart about her strange behaviour. He sighed and walked to Qi Jianqiu’s side.</p> 
 <p>“Jianqiu, you don’t need to worry about this matter. Your health is more important.”</p> 
 <p>Qi Jianqiu raised her head and stared at Gan Qingjia with her bright-looking eyes. “But if something happens to Luodi, I won’t feel any better.”</p> 
 <p>“Jianqiu!”</p> 
 <p>Gan Qingjia’s voice went a few octaves higher as he said, “You’re currently in a very dangerous phase. Just leave this matter to me.”</p> 
 <p>“Hmph.” Qi Jianqiu sneered.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t think that I don’t know that you’re investigating Luodi. Luodi is Luodi. There’s no problem with her at all. She’s my best friend and this fact would never change in this lifetime. Even if her behaviour and notions are somewhat different than those of the people in the Xuan Kingdom, it wouldn’t change anything.”</p> 
 <p>“Qingjia, don’t tell me that after you have found out her so-called real identity, you’re going to give up on saving her? Or possibly persuade Situ to not save her? If that’s the case, you don’t need to come and see me anymore.”</p> 
 <p>Gan Qingjia was speechless.</p> 
 <p><em>Everyone was forcing Situ to commit a crime. That was the only way for Situ to save Feng Luodi.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Would Situ choose that path?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Would he save Feng Luodi without hesitation, even if he had to break into the court prison? In that case, Situ would lose his position as the General of the Northern Army. Could it be that he didn’t mind being burdened by infamy? Then what about his great undertaking? What about the person he had always wanted to support and the forces he commanded for so many years?</em></p> 
 <p><em>For the past few years, hadn’t Situ done all he could to let the First Prince ascend the throne?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Yet, all of his plans were wrecked by an ordinary woman, who suddenly intruded his life.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Even if the Emperor is old and weak, he is still a formidable person. He actually managed to accurately grab hold of Situ’s Achilles heel and force Situ to walk a path of no return.</em></p> 
 <p><em>He could ignore the requests of all his officials. He could ignore the pressure of the commandery princes. He could ignore everything, just for the sake of reclaiming Situ’s military power legitimately and conveniently send Situ to hell.</em></p> 
 <p><em>This move was really vicious…really despicable.</em></p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>The day before Feng Luodi was subjected to the death sentence and before Situ was to head back to the deserts of the North.</p> 
 <p>Situ stood in the study and stared at the garden. The beautiful flower over there was still blooming and the pavilion over there was quiet as usual. The scenery was just missing that person’s silhouette. He could still remember her slender and elegant, partly indifferent and partly unyielding ethereal appearance. The scenery back then was quite unforgettable.</p> 
 <p>“Two, go and invite the First Prince to come over to my residence.”</p>
