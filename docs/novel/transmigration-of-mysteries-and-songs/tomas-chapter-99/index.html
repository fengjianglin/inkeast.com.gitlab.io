 <p><span>Chapter 99 Cloud Nine: By the River</span></p>
 <p><span>"Miss Crystal's voice is as melodious as I remember. If only I can get to hold her hand for once…“ Qi Jianqiu mumbled under her breath unconsciously. As she enjoyed Crystal's performance, a familiar voice floated its way into her ears.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Let you tell me the difference, Yiqi. Miss Crystal is pure and vibrant, while Miss Linglong is elegant. Miss Emerald, when she was still around, was tantalising and seductive." It was Gan Qingjia.</span></p>
 <p><span>Xue Yiqi scratched his head. "Really? I could never tell the difference between them. Perhaps I haven't spent enough time with them yet."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Alright, alright. Let's talk about the women you know better, then." Gan Qingjia rolled his eyes. "Miss Feng, the girl who Situ is close to, is poised and confident. Meanwhile, Miss Qi Jianqiu's beauty is dazzling to the eyes, bewitching all who lay their eyes on her. Can you tell the difference now?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Uhhhhh…" Xue Yiqi tousled his hair and grinned. "All I know is that Miss Qi is indeed really beautiful!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Gan Qingjia snorted. </span><i><span>What an honest boy! </span></i><span>He was about to lecture the kid when he felt a burning gaze landing on his face. </span><i><span>There is only one person who would look at me like that…</span></i></p>
 <p><span>He spun to the left and his gaze met hers. Their voices echoed in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Why are you here again?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Xue Yiqi looked to his left as well and smiled shyly. "What a coincidence, Miss Qi."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Coincidental indeed." Qi Jianqiu rolled her eyes. "Why didn't you guys go to </span><i><span>Moonglade </span></i><span>instead? It would've been much better if we didn’t meet."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Why didn't you go to </span><i><span>Moonglade</span></i><span> then, Jianqiu?" Gan Qingjia gracefully waved the fan in his hand around, regaining his composure.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hey! Who gave you the right to call me by my name? What's more, am I not allowed to come to </span><i><span>Smoke Mirrors </span></i><span>today?" Qi Jianqiu glared at him. "Well, I never would've taken the two of you as gossipmongers!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Xue Yiqi quickly shook his head, trying to explain himself. "Please don't be upset, Miss Qi. We were just chatting amongst ourselves; we did not say anything about you."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hmph!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Xue Yiqi smiled awkwardly and quickly tried to change the topic. "I don't see Miss Feng here with you today?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Unlike the two of you who waste your days in these zither parlours, she has important matters to attend to!" Qi Jianqiu looked at the two of them in disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span>Xue Yiqi smiled awkwardly again. </span><i><span>If she says that of us, doesn't that apply to herself as well? </span></i><span>Xue Yiqi pondered quietly. Thankfully, he was not so dense as to voice it out this time.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>Meanwhile, Feng Luodi was tending to that "important matter" of hers - none other than the arrival of one of the 10 Guqin. Fei had set out to retrieve Cloud Nine a few days prior, the Guqin having been located a while back by one of Autumnal Ombre's merchant caravans. The Guqin was due to arrive in Chang'an today, and the overjoyed Feng Luodi could barely wait to meet the Guqin, and Fei, by the river.</span></p>
 <p><span>The river was used both as means of transport and as an area of entertainment, where artistes and poets alike gather on ferries and tour the river together. </span><i><span>Perhaps Jianqiu and I could do that someday; I'm sure she's bored of the zither parlours by now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Young miss, will you be bringing either of us out today? The riverside will be crowded with tourists and the citizens alike; we wouldn't feel safe for you if you were out in the chaos alone!" Jet voiced her concerned as she slowly helped Feng Luodi get ready for her day.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hmmm… why don't-" Feng Luodi was about to give in but Situ's words popped into her head. </span><i><span>How dare he tease that I'm always causing trouble! Argh! I can't give in to his challenge so easily! </span></i><span>"No need for that, Jet. I'll be meeting Fei soon by the riverside and he'll be with me on the way back."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Alright, young miss. Please be careful on your way." Jet sighed and handed her the bag of money.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Just wait here in my courtyard. Don’t go anywhere, alright? Especially not Mother's courtyard!" Feng Luodi knew how easily Jet would give in to the First Lady's questioning.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Yes, young miss." Jet bobbed her head obediently.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>The Jing River and the Wei River met at the outskirts of the capital, forming the river that flowed through Chang'an. It was a beautiful sight in spring, the riverbanks green with grass as birds flitted overhead in the trees. Boats and ferries dotted the river, songs and laughter floating across the water as their owners enjoyed themselves. One such ferry, in particular, stood out from the rest, much more luxurious and richly decorated than its counterparts. A purple character "Chu" was embossed in its side, a mark of the Commandery Prince of Huaiyang, the Chu family.</span></p>
 <p><span>"It's much more fun out here than in the palace, Xiaoxiao! I was bored out of my wits when I was in the palace!" Princess Shangrong, also known as Liu Shang, was standing on the deck of the ferry with Chu Xiaoxiao, gazing enthusiastically into the open. Chu Huaicai sat in a corner of the deck, watching the two girls weakly, unable to join into their 'girl-talk'.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I told you, didn't I? My brother is quite the man, isn't he?" Chu Xiaoxiao raised an eyebrow. "You were only able to leave the palace because of us!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang pinched Chu Xiaoxiao's nose playfully. "Hey! Do you have to be so petty? We grew up together! Speaking of which, we have barely met since you'd returned to Huaiyang, and that is only for the few days when you visit me in Chang'an."</span></p>
 <p><span>"That can't be helped." Chu Xiaoxiao shrugged and smiled cheekily. "Why don't you get married in Huaiyang instead? That way we can always be together!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Why don't you marry to Chang'an instead? Huaiyang is so far away!" Liu Shang pouted.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I don’t like Chang'an; there're too many rules around here!" Chu Xiaoxiao got worked up as she recounted her past few days in Chang'an. "Someone told me off a few days back just because of a few lowly peasants! What's more, I couldn't do anything about it due to his high rank! That is the first time I've ever been reprimanded by anyone in my entire life! How dare he scold me! It was all because of that ugly woman he tried to defend!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang tugged on her sleeve, perplexed. "There aren't many people who're higher ranking than your brother in Chang'an, other than the royal family."</span></p>
 <p><span>"My brother addressed him as the 'Duke of Anping'." Chu Xiaoxiao recalled. "I've heard of the man before; isn't he just a General of the Army? There's nothing to act so high and mighty about!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"The Duke of Anping?" Liu Shang was surprised. "He isn't someone like that, I'm sure of it! Although he looks cold on the outside, he's actually very kind and capable! Despite having left his post in the army, he's still one of Father's most important officials in court! Are you sure that the man you saw is the Duke of Anping?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"I'm pretty sure; that was how my brother had addressed him anyway." Chu Xiaoxiao glanced at Chu Huaicai before turning back to Liu Shang. "Shang'er, do you like that Duke of Anping? This is the first time I've seen you praise someone like that!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang blushed but did not answer the question.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Xiaoxiao looked at her brother awkwardly. Sure enough, Chu Huaicai's face was as dark as soot. She quickly turned back to Liu Shang.</span></p>
 <p><span>"But he'd seemed very close to that woman that day; close enough to put his hand over her, at least. He even scolded me for her!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang's face turned sour. "I've heard the rumours that the Duke is infatuated with the daughter of a Second Rank Official before, but I'm sure she's just a salacious woman that's trying to claw her way onto his bed, bewitching him with her foxy looks. He wouldn't even meet me in private because of her!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"But the woman isn't good looking at all; how can he be so blind?" Chu Xiaoxiao mumbled and caught a knowing look from her brother. "The Duke of Anping doesn't know how precious you are, Shang'er, but my brother is well aware of that! The three of us grew up together since young, and he'd always protected you from any trouble. He'd always did his best to give you everything that you've wanted. Do you understand his intentions?"</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Liu Shang was not in the mood to entertain Chu Huaicai's courtship. "I know, I know. Anyway, can you find out her identity for me, Xiaoxiao? You saw her face that day, didn't you?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Xiaoxiao looked at her, conflicted. "I don't know who she is, Shang'er. I didn't feel the need to find out her identity that day, seeing as how lowly she is compared to us."</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang pulled on her sleeves. "Do it for me, wouldn't you? Father has forbidden us from gathering our own followers and I don't have anyone else to use! You're the only one that can help me now."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Alright, alright." Chu Xiaoxiao nodded. "I'll look into it for you. That's what best friends are for, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Liu Shang's face relaxed upon hearing her promise and turned her attention back to the river. A smaller boat came up the river towards them and docked by the riverbank, right beside their ferry.</span></p>
 <p><span>"How annoying! It's blocking my view!" Liu Shang grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Huaicai stood up and walked towards the side of the ferry. "I'll get someone to chase them away, my Princess."</span></p>
 <p><span>"You can count on my brother anytime!" Chu Xiaoxiao chuckled as her gaze wandered over to the riverbank, where it landed on a woman dressed in green. She frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Shang'er, that's the woman! That's the girl who was with the Duke of Anping that day!"</span></p>
