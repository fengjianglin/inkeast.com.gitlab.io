 <p><span>Chapter 159 Green Vines: The Viciousness of the Human Heart &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“The two of you really have a tacit understanding with each other.” On the way back to the yamen, Lu Buping gritted his teeth as he said to Feng Luodi. Beside Feng Luodi was Situ, silent and stone-faced.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lu Buping had no choice but to admit that Situ’s words explained by Feng Luodi made sense but their Demonic Sect and the Righteous White Paths have accumulated rancour for a very long time. This time, he was conceited and forgot himself for a moment such that he actually belittled Sect Leader Xiao’s vicious motives. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi covered her mouth and laughed lightly, then looked at Situ beside her and did not speak.</span></p>
 <p><span>When they were one turn away from the yamen, Lu Buping suddenly noticed something and said, “I still have some matters to deal with. I’ll return to the yamen later.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Before the other two could reply him, he leapt away and disappeared into a small alley.</span></p>
 <p><span>Only after Lu Buping had left did Situ faintly said, “What a hindrance.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Eh.” Feng Luodi raised her head to look at Situ and discovered that he still had on a moody expression. When she recalled how Situ confidently said that he would let her watch a good show but it was cut short in the end, she reckoned that this man was certainly very gloomy inside but found it hard to express it.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi’s lips pointed upwards to form a small arc. She reached out a hand to grasp Situ’s hand, then swaggered as she walked into the yamen. </span></p>
 <p><span>Situ’s mood instantly turned from one of overcast weather to one of a clear sky and he also withdrew the cold aura he constantly emanated. The covert guards hiding in the dark clicked their tongues as they watched the rare side of Situ. </span><i><span>As expected, everything has its vanquisher. Their mighty and wise General’s mood could also be influenced by a young lady. Maybe, in the future, a young lady can even influence his decisions.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>The two entered the yamen and did not see Governor Tian around. Even the group of officials were not around and the First Prince had also gone out. He was probably doing his best to charm the commoners in the province, trying to turn the tides. </span></p>
 <p><span>The couple was delighted that they had the place to themselves. They found a pot of good wine and ran into the courtyard, sitting under the brilliant red plum blossom tree. They sipped cups of wine one after another as plum blossoms drifted down. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi had not drunk wine in a long time. As soon as one cup of wine entered her stomach, her face quickly flushed red, contrasting against the snow white colour of her skin even more. Her eyes when she was tipsy was like the autumn breeze, flirtatious and moving. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ had completely tossed whatever conspiracies, whatever great undertakings and whatever stratagems out of his mind. There was only that blue-dressed woman in his eyes. Her every frown and smile tugged on his heartstrings. This had nothing to do with her looks or family background. His feelings came very quickly and he was mesmerised before he could prepare himself. He suddenly wanted to go back on his words. </span><i><span>No matter what happens in the future, I won’t let this woman leave me. What would a future without her be like? Who will I be?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>After Feng Luodi drank a few more cups and glanced at Situ again, she realised that his expression was complicated, his eyes profound and unfathomable. She was curious about his sudden change and was just about to voice her thoughts when the panicked voice of a yamen runner could be heard from outside the courtyard. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Your Grace, things aren’t looking good. A group of unruly civilians are making a ruckus outside the yamen.” </span></p>
 <p><span>This sentence immediately pulled Situ back from his contemplation and slightly restrained the coldness in his eyes. Situ stood up and told Feng Luodi, “Let’s go take a look together.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span>Together?</span></i><span> Feng Luodi laughed in spite of herself. She was really not used to Situ constantly saying such words. </span></p>
 <p><span>The yamen runner was waiting for the two of them outside the courtyard with an anxious expression, not daring to intrude by entering. He quickly explained the situation to them as he led them outside the yamen. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Your Grace, just now, a group of commoners suddenly rushed to the gates of the yamen, clamouring that we have already arrested the murderer from the Demonic Sect, Lu Buping, who killed dozens of county magistrates. They are demanding that Governor Tian quickly deal with Lu Buping in front of everyone. It’s also not good for the yamen runners to injure them but neither the Governor and his Highness, the First Prince are around. What should we do?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>That yamen runner spoke urgently but Feng Luodi who was beside him noticed that his eyes were calm. He was simply apathetic to the matter. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span>When Lu Buping stayed in the yamen, all officials with some rank would know but First Prince had commanded that the matter be kept under wraps. In that case, how did this piece of news get out?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>The heavy vermilion red door was opened. Situ strode to the front of the crowd of commoners who were blocked by the yamen runners. The commoners who were just making a din instantly quietened down. Under the pressure of Situ’s might, it was actually absolutely silent inside and outside the yamen. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“You all are congregating in a crowd and creating trouble outside the provincial court. Does everyone want to have a taste of the meals we provide in prison?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ’s voice was low and deep, bearing the weight of an enormous boulder. While it was cold, it also made people feel a little reassured at the same time. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Only after quite a while did a civilian bravely asked, “Your Grace, we only heard that the murderer, Lu Buping, has been seized. This kind of diabolical evildoer should be punished immediately. You can’t practise favouritism.” </span></p>
 <p><span>Situ’s gaze slowly shifted onto that person. He was not furious but smiled instead. “Who are you insinuating that practices favouritism? The yamen or me?”</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a voice more icy cold than the frigid wind. That civilians immediately stopped talking. It was only because they have all heard of General’s fame. This was someone they worshipped and they would never suspect a person they worshipped.</span></p>
 <p><span>Another civilian spoke. “In that case, could Your Grace give everyone an explanation now? As long as the murderer still runs free, we find it hard to calm our hearts!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ‘s eyes were composed. He slowly said, “I also had the same intention as everyone to capture the murderer as early as we can, but, I will only say this once today.” </span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s still unknown as to whether the murderer is the Demonic Sect’s Lu Buping. The yamen judges a case based on evidence. Under circumstances when there is no evidence, I hope that everyone won’t be misled by the rumours. Neither his Highness, the First Prince, nor I, will practice favouritism. No matter who we find out as the murderer, I will definitely ensure that he gets executed. Nobody needs to worry.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>As Feng Luodi looked at Situ who stood tall and made people involuntarily look up to him, she suddenly recalled what the covert guard, Duo, had once told her.</span></p>
 <p><span>“General seems to have an innate power which makes people believe in him and let everyone subconsciously follow behind him. Regardless of how perilous the journey is, because of General, no one would cower and retreat.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span>This is the Situ Muye I know.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>The commoners gradually dissipated. Before Situ walked into the yamen, he coldly looked at that yamen runner who reported to him.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Remember what I just said. You should know what to do next right?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I know.” That yamen runner immediately lowered his head and hid a strange expression on his face. </span></p>
 <p><span>Only when they had entered the yamen and arrived at the courtyard where no one passed by did Feng Luodi turn to ask Situ. “Do you feel that there’s a problem with that person just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ snorted coldly. “There are problems with the majority of the people in this yamen.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span>Then why are we staying here?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi’s reason caused her to swallow this question back into her stomach. What she asked was something else instead. “Could it be that the person who incited the common people is a person from the yamen?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi felt that the situation was far from good. They had constantly been staying in the yamen. If there was a spy of the murderer here, then their every action would be seen by that person. </span></p>
 <p><span>Right at this very moment, Feng Luodi no longer thought that Lu Buping was the culprit who killed fifteen officials. That sentence of Situ, ‘there’s no need to collaborate anymore’ made her extremely confident. She trusted Situ’s decision, so she was willing to believe Lu Buping. Situ turned his head around to look at Feng Luodi, releasing the tension in his knitted eyebrows. Before he even had a chance to say a word, Lu Buping jumped down from a tall enclosing wall. He randomly waved his ‘Frigid Moon Blade’ and he sneered, “It’s also possible that it was that bastard from Qing Cheng Sect who incited them. Or it could be both.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi’s eyebrows were slightly furrowed. There was clearly an overtone in Lu Buping’s words but he deliberately said it as if he had nothing to do with the affairs of the world. </span></p>
 <p><span><span>“Young Knight-errant Lu, finished settling your matters already?” Feng Luodi smiled sweetly and changed to a congenial tactic<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.</span></span></p>
 <p><span>Lu Buping exclaimed that women were capricious. Only after he took several steps back did he put on a respectful expression and told Feng Luodi and Situ, “I received an intelligence just now. My people from the Demonic Sect thought that I was incarcerated in the yamen and are rushing here. They will reach in less than half a day.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“They’re so worried about you and rushing here to rescue you.” Feng Luodi smiled while deeply moved. </span></p>
 <p><span>Once she said this sentence, Lu Buping was completely embarrassed instead.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hehe, they are rushing here to laugh at me and at the same time, to see if I have died.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi refrained herself from twitching the corner of her mouth and looked at Situ, “What do we do now? If the people from the Demonic Sect come, then that would imply that they have fallen into a trap. What does that person in the shadows want to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“We will find out very soon,” Situ said indifferently and brushed off a plum blossom which had landed on Feng Luodi’s hair as if there was no one else present. </span></p>
 <p><span>Lu Buping turned his eyes away and chanted his Qi Er’s name in his heart while speaking, “Isn’t he a general? Don’t those who fight in battles have a saying called ‘when the soldiers come, use a general to ward them off and when the flood comes, use dirt to stem the flow.’ Nothing bad will happen.” Lu Buping broke into a very large and brilliant smile.</span></p>
 <p><span>“We are on the same side now. You all have to quickly stop that bunch of lunatics from the Demonic Sect.” </span></p>
 <p><span>“You are also from the Demonic Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi calmly stated this fact but in her heart, she was immensely curious about this sect which received varying appraisals and censures. </span></p>
 <p><span>Lu Buping smiled embarrassedly. He had clearly latched onto Situ and the others. </span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi originally thought that Situ would be displeased but who would have known that he only said very casually, “Then that would have to depend if you’re sincere.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s a given.” Lu Buping raised his eyebrows and smiled full of confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi looked at these two people in doubt. </span><i><span>I have been with Situ for almost every single moment. When had they reached a secret agreement without me around? </span></i></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi tugged on her hair, feeling strange, but Situ took the strand of hair into his hands instead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Mhm?” Feng Luodi looked at him in puzzlement. </span></p>
 <p><span>Situ smiled faintly with a gentle expression. “Pull mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi blinked her eyes. </span><i><span>What trickery is it this time? </span></i></p>
 <p><span>Lu Buping gazed at the sky and pretended that he did not notice. He did not expect that such a steady, solemn and ruthless Situ Muye would reveal this kind of expression and say such words. </span><i><span>When one has lived long enough, you can really see anything.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>When silence hung over the courtyard, Covert Guard Two suddenly appeared with a solemn face. </span></p>
 <p><span>“General,” Covert Guard Two lowly called, attracting their attention.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What happened?” Situ understood his own Covert Guards well. He rarely saw Two revealing this expression.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lu Buping was fearful. </span><i><span>When did this person appear? I didn’t notice anything.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Covert Guard Two said in a deep voice and paused after every word. “General, I discovered that Qing Cheng Sect’s sect leader has invited E Mei Sect, Kun Lun Sect as well as other sects. The group of them are currently rushing here expeditiously. Chang’an is also aware of this news.”</span></p>
 <p><span>As soon as Covert Guard Two uttered these words, the first to change his expression was Lu Buping. This time, it could be considered that he finally understood why some people would make an issue of him. </span><i><span>In this way, they can lure the Demonic Sect out. The members of the Righteous White Path have gathered with such an impressive display of their power. Their objective is too obvious.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>When he reached that realisation, the bottoms of Lu Buping’s eyes were filled with killing intent. </span></p>
