 <p><span>Chapter 153 Green Vines: The Demonic Sect</span></p>
 <p><span>Once again, Feng Luodi and Situ set off from Chang'an in the deep of Autumn, heading straight for Dingtao Province. However, many things have changed this time: Chamberlain Feng no longer objected to Feng Luodi's request, Jiang Moyin was now too weak to send her off, and Qi Jianqiu was too busy with her new love. Much has changed in the span of a year.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Dingtao Province was not far away from Chang'an, the journey taking ten days to reach as they took to the waterways and drifted downstream. The province used to be a natural swampland many years ago, and the lands were riddled with lakes and rivers. Other than their geographic characteristics, the region was known for its peonies and hence, development in the arts. The martial arts were also widely practised in the region, resulting in the formation of many sects of the&nbsp;</span><em><span>jianghu&nbsp;</span></em><span>amongst the people.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ and Feng Luodi travelled along the waterways for nine days, renting a carriage from a small town in the province to head to the richest area of the province, the provincial city. The First Prince and Situ spent most of their time engaged in discussion, leaving Feng Luodi to take in the scenery on her own.</span></p>
 <p><span><span>Dingtao had a climate that was cold and dry, forcing Feng Luodi to bundle herself up in a heap of clothes every morning. Thanks to the research she had done about the area prior to the journey, she was looking forward to visiting many places: the Peony Garden, known for being the largest of its kind in the kingdom; the XuanNu Temple <span id="footnote-ref-1ae9"><a href="#footnote-1ae9">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;</span>for its uncanny predictions, the tea of the Jade Teahouse, the beauties of the Guzheng Parlour, and the talented gentlemen that regularly gather in the Gallery of Mirages. Perhaps due to Situ's comforting presence, Feng Luodi found herself much more relaxed than usual, even hatching plans to drag Situ on her sightseeing trips with her.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, her plans were reduced the moment they entered Dingtao.</span></p>
 <p><span>Dingtao was a developed region, but what they saw reflected the opposite. The streets were virtually empty of pedestrians, and most shops were closed. The doors of houses were half opened, the occasional head that stuck out shooting&nbsp;quizzical glances at them.</span></p>
 <p><span>"The whole place is so…dead." Feng Luodi was perplexed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ and the First Prince exchanged looks, knowing how hard their job was going to be. The First Prince got out of the carriage and waved to his attendants. He swiftly mounted a horse and rode at the head of the convoy. Immediately, his men started shouting to the people.</span></p>
 <p><span>"His Majesty understands your fear and has sent an ambassador to investigate the murders of the fifteen magistrates. There is no need to worry; if you have any information on the murders, come to us at the yamen. Your safety will be ensured."</span></p>
 <p><span>The convoy marched in unison, having undergone training by Situ on their way to Dingtao. The confidence exuded by the First Prince and the convoy reassured the people somewhat and they slowly came out of their houses, examining the convoy up close. The First Prince nodded to himself, satisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ and Feng Luodi sat in the carriage, their eyes trained upon the First Prince who sat upright on his steed, his face much sterner than it usually was. His eyes were serious, and his very aura commanded respect. Feng Luodi turned to look at Situ and saw that his dark eyes were practically glowing.</span></p>
 <p><span>She smiled, but Situ spoke up. "If you have to interact with the prince these days, be clandestine about it."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hmm?" Feng Luodi blinked, confused.</span></p>
 <p><span>"We are being watched." Situ let the drapes fall back into place. Just before the drapes closed completely, his eyes locked onto a spot outside of the carriage and his lips curled upwards into a cold smile.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Men sent by the Emperor?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Not only by the Emperor." Situ shook his head. "That of the other princes as well. This business with Dingtao seems fishy."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi raised a hand and gently smoothened the crease between Situ's brows. Her voice was calm when she spoke. "We'll find out what we need to know when we reach the yamen; it can't be that bad."</span></p>
 <p><span>"I guess."</span></p>
 <p><span>When the convoy reached the yamen, Governor Tian was already waiting with his officials at the gates of the yamen.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Tian Zhen welcomes your Highness; the blessings be upon you, your Highness."</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince dismounted briskly and quickly helped the governor to his feet, a warm smile on his face. "You have done well, Governor Tian. Please, quickly lead me to the bodies of the fifteen magistrates."</span></p>
 <p><span>"About that…" Tian Zhen was a middle-aged man forty-five years of age, and his interpersonal skills have been honed to near perfection with his years in court.&nbsp;</span><em><span>His courteous mannerisms must be a facade, seeing as how he's a royal prince.&nbsp;</span></em><span>Governor Tian smiled. "I have already prepared rooms and wine for you, Your Highness. You must be tired from your journey; please, have a good rest."</span></p>
 <p><span>Displeasure shone in the eyes of the First Prince, but before he could voice his opinion, Situ walked close with Feng Luodi in tow. His voice was steely.</span></p>
 <p><span>"The bodies of the fifteen magistrates are still warm, and yet you seem to be enjoying life yourself, Governor Tian." Situ rarely spoke with any emotion, and when he did right then, Governor Tian felt a shiver crawl up his spine. When his eyes met the inkwells of Situ, he almost felt his legs tremble.</span></p>
 <p><span>"My apologies, Duke of Anping; I shall lead the way to the morgue right away." Governor Tian was as respectful as he could be.</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince relaxed somewhat. He knew that he had to give such officials a scare from the start, or their investigation would be severely hindered. The convoy left to be settled into the yamen, while the First Prince, Situ and Feng Luodi followed after Governor Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span>The reports were submitted to Chang'an deftly, and not much time was wasted on the journey from Chang'an to Dingtao. When they arrived at the morgue, the fifteen corpses were still in relatively good shape. The First Prince entered the dingy room without any hesitation in his luxurious clothes and Situ followed behind, shutting Feng Luodi out of the morgue. Feng Luodi rubbed her nose and could only wait for Situ by a stone table in the courtyard. Snacks and tea were quickly served for her, the accompanying cleric perplexed by her appearance.&nbsp;</span><em><span>Why is a woman here, when the Duke is here on an investigation? He must really know how to enjoy life huh?</span></em></p>
 <p><span>In the morgue, the coroner showed the wounds on the bodies to Situ and First Prince. "All fifteen victims were killed by sharp objects, each and every one of them the result of a practised slice to the neck. The murderer was precise and practiced; perhaps only the men of the&nbsp;</span><em><span>jianghu&nbsp;</span></em><span>could carry out attacks like these."</span></p>
 <p><span>Governor Tian agreed. "Exactly. If you haven't heard about it, the number of sects and cults in the Dingtao province are more than that of any other province. With the added prosperity brought about by trade, it is hard for us to keep track of the identities of everyone; all of us fear for our lives."</span></p>
 <p><span>While Situ examined the wounds carefully, the First Prince turned to Governor Tian, a half-smile on his face. "Do you interact with these magistrates often?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Of course I do." Governor Tian answered swiftly. "Ever since the new rule decreed by his Majesty, the magistrates report to me in the yamen every two weeks. Through the years, we've developed good relationships with each other."</span></p>
 <p><span>"If that's the case," the First Prince raised an eyebrow, "who do you think they've offended to warrant such an attack?"</span></p>
 <p><span>The smile on the governor's face froze for a second, but he quickly recovered. "From what I observed, none of them made any enemies. Perhaps, the men of the&nbsp;</span><em><span>jianghu</span></em><span>&nbsp;are just doing it on a whim; that's how they've always been."</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince laughed. "You seem very convinced that they are killed by men of the&nbsp;</span><em><span>jianghu</span></em><span>, Governor. Perhaps you might have someone in mind?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Governor Tian knew that he had spoken too quickly and shot the coroner a look. The coroner stepped forward and bowed respectfully at the First Prince. "There's someone in the&nbsp;</span><em><span>jianghu</span></em><span>&nbsp;who loves to kill his enemies with one blow to the neck. I have had a good look at the wounds, and it matches my suspicions."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Oh?" The smile the First Prince had on was warm and gentle, yet it deeply unnerved Governor Tian. "Pray tell me, who is it?"</span></p>
 <p><span>The coroner spoke carefully. "It is the man they call&nbsp;</span><em><span>Yidaozhan </span></em><span><span id="footnote-ref-89bc"><a href="#footnote-89bc">[2]</a></span></span><span>, Lu Buping. He is a villainous man of the Demonic Sect."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Exactly." Governor Tian chimed in as well. "These years, the members of the Demonic Sect have been causing much chaos amongst the people, but they are all individually very skilled and it has been extremely hard to catch them. But to think that they even dare to assassinate the officials of the kingdom this time! Please bring them in, your Highness!"</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince's eyes darkened.&nbsp;</span><em><span>So this is what he's been trying to tell me.&nbsp;</span></em><span>Situ finished checking the bodies and finally spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your Highness, it is indeed the doing of the men of the&nbsp;</span><em><span>jianghu</span></em><span>."</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince looked surprised, but he also saw the look of relief on the faces of the coroner and the governor. "Seems like I do have to look into the men of the&nbsp;</span><em><span>jianghu</span></em><span>." The First Prince said as he carefully observed the governor.</span></p>
 <p><span>A look of glee flashed across the face of the governor, but he quickly hid it.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>Meanwhile, Feng Luodi chatted amicably with the cleric who had delivered her snacks, almost bored out of her wits. The cleric, a clean looking man about thirty years of age, kept a mousy moustache despite his youthful age. That look, coupled with his small eyes and flat nose, made him look weird.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was not one to judge a book by its covers, but the cleric was obviously trying to weasel three points of information out of her: the likes and dislikes of Situ and the First Prince, her identity, and the evidence they have on their hands, if any. Of course, Feng Luodi knew that his real interest lay in the last question, but she played dumb and merely danced around his questions.&nbsp;</span><em><span>I definitely need to talk to Situ about this; everyone in this yamen seems…weird.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly, a commotion from outside the courtyard interrupted their conversation. A group of unfamiliar men dressed in uniform came into the courtyard, and Feng Luodi quickly guessed their identities.&nbsp;</span><em><span>These men must be the assistant magistrates and constables of the fifteen counties that have lost their magistrates.</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Though the cleric looked and acted the part of a weasel, he knew his job well and frowned as he lectured the men. "Are you trying to violate the laws you uphold? Who are you to enter the yamen without clearance?"</span></p>
 <p><span>A bear of a man stepped forward. "We are here to ask the governor a question: if he knows the identity of the murderer, why is he not arresting the man yet?"</span></p>
 <p><span>The cleric was at a loss for words. Although he worked for the governor, his official rank was the same as that of the constables, albeit without the power behind the rank. Feng Luodi stood up and gently patted the dust off her skirt. Just as she was about to speak up, the door to the morgue opened and Situ and the First Prince stepped out, the governor dabbing furiously at this forehead behind them.</span></p>
