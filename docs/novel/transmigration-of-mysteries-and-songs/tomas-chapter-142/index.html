 <p><span>Chapter 142 Burnt Ends: The Storm’s Arrival</span></p>
 <p><span>Early Autumn was just like Summer, bringing with it a lot of rain. It came without any warning and in the blink of an eye the entire Chang’an’s sky was covered with dark clouds. The people on the street just finished sighing and complaining that it was going to rain when large droplets of water started falling. The rain got heavier and pattered noisily against the roofs.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin sat under the corridor, watching the raindrops fall to the ground. The world seemed to be only left with the sounds of the rain. It was very peaceful. However, the peace was soon broken by sets of hurried footsteps. A few men in straw caps rushed in from the antechamber. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Master.” the men bowed to Jiang Moyin. They all had a serious expression on their face.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin looked at their face and knew the outcome. He asked with some hope, “Did you manage to stop them?”</span></p>
 <p><span>The men looked at each other and one of them finally stepped out. His face was guilty as he answered, “Master, we are really sorry. Our men did not manage to stop the Heir’s assassins from attacking the Duke of Anping residence. Neither did we manage to get any news of the outcome. We are too useless.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin shook his head and remained silent.</span></p>
 <p><span>The leader of the group looked at Jiang Moyin who was staring blankly at the grey sky and asked, “Master, what should we do now?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin retracted his gaze. His voice was indifferent with a hint of sadness that was hard to detect, “There is nothing I can do now. If you want to stay, you can look for the head steward.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The leader looked at Jiang Moyin’s expression and wanted to say something. The person behind him quickly stopped him. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Let Master have some time alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The man sighed and left with the others. The rain did not look like it was letting up anytime soon, the raindrops continuing their patter on the ground. His heart felt like it was being struck by every single drop of rain.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin’s heart pumped faster. He felt a gasp of wind behind him and heard heavy footsteps. He knew the person approaching wanted him to know of his arrival. </span></p>
 <p><span>He was here.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I’m sorry,” Jiang Moyin leaned out of the corridor. The cold raindrops fell on his face, “I have guessed that the mastermind was the Heir but I did not tell you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The owner of the footsteps was Situ. He stopped a distance away from Jiang Moyin and leaned against a pillar along the corridor. He looked at Jiang Moyin and said in a low voice, “I knew about it when you decided to quit your position as the Heir’s teacher. It was not too late.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin turned his back to Situ, his clothes billowing about his frail figure from the wind. “That was the only thing I could do after I found out what happened. But I still have to apologise. I chose him in the end.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ remained silent. </span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin continued talking relentlessly, “A long time ago, the Heir and the First Prince were the same, morally upright and hardworking. Eight years later, the Heir changed but the First Prince did not. Does this means the First Prince has won?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ rubbed his eyebrows. The past was always the hardest to let go.</span></p>
 <p><span>“If there is no you, the First Prince would not win, right?” Jiang Moyin suddenly turned his head and smiled at Situ.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ remained indifferent.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The Heir did the right thing,” Jiang Moyin continued smiling, “but you are too powerful.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Moyin,” Situ called.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I am tired. You can leave, Situ. I have accepted the outcome. I have lost in every single aspect.” Jiang Moyin was still filled with smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You must be careful no matter who the Emperor is.” Situ had no choice but to leave. “The Emperor will know of the issue tonight. Tomorrow, everything will come to an end.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin closed his eyes and no longer looked at Situ.</span></p>
 <p><span>That year, he was nine years old. He was the son of a 1st Rank Officer, the Censor-in-chief of the kingdom. He was really smart as a child and had read many books. At a very young age, he was made known to the Emperor and he made the Emperor so happy that the Emperor asked him to take the Imperial Test earlier to become an official.</span></p>
 <p><span>That year, he was ten years old. He was the son of the loyal Senior General Situ. He had displayed his talent matters of the military at a young age. Unlike children his age, he was trustworthy and decisive. He yearned to be part of the army and killed enemies and also wished to learn from experienced generals. </span></p>
 <p><span>The two of them met on a sunny day in the Imperial Gardens. There was no conflict that arose between them. Unexpectedly, they became good friends and decided to meet again soon to play. When they met the next day, they brought along their friends. One of them was the Second Prince who had a powerful background but was ordinary, and the other was the kind and benevolent First Prince who was of ordinary birth.</span></p>
 <p><span>Once upon a time, they were friends. </span></p>
 <p><span>They didn’t know what their future would give them.</span></p>
 <p><span>That year, he was thirteen years old, and he became the study companion of the Second Prince. They spoke about poems and music as well as the ways of ruling a kingdom. Gradually, their relationship changed to that of a ruler and a subordinate. </span></p>
 <p><span>That year, he was fourteen years old. He followed his father to the plains of the North and started learning from scratch. No one took special care of him despite his birth. He earned everything himself. The people who once looked down on him changed their perspective when he became a General at the age of eighteen. They started to respect him.</span></p>
 <p><span>That time, they still exchanged letters periodically and talked about the happenings in Chang’an and the Northern Plains. However, when he was nineteen, the Second Prince became the Heir and he became the Grand Tutor. Fame and recognition came to him while he was still a General defending the country against the Huns. No one could predict that the First Prince would be exiled to Yizhou, possibly staying there till his death. He remembered how helpless he felt when he was repeatedly asked about the situation of the First Prince in his letters.</span></p>
 <p><span>The ending seemed to be in place.</span></p>
 <p><span>When he was twenty-three years old, the Heir’s power slowly spread itself amongst the entire court. The Emperor trusted the Heir increasingly, their ambition seemingly on the verge of being fulfilled. That time, he’d returned to the capital, decorated with achievements and was promoted to a rank higher than the ministers of the kingdom. He became the Duke of Anping, the only Duke that is not of royal birth.</span></p>
 <p><span>They were still friends, but they were also political enemies. </span></p>
 <p><span>Now, he is twenty-six. The foundation that he took thirteen years to build was crumbling. The Heir was also moving further away from the ideal ruler that he had in his heart. </span></p>
 <p><span>He is Jiang Moyin.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>That morning, the entire court was in shock. The problem that they were facing was the Heir of the Kingdom. The Minister of the Right was asked to list out the evidence while standing beside the Eight Prince. The Heir was barred from entering the court.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor did not comment.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Eight Prince was very nervous. When he reported to the Emperor previously, the Emperor was suspicious and repeatedly questioned his conclusions. He’d even sent his Covert Guards to investigate the case. The Emperor rarely used his Convert Guards.</span></p>
 <p><span>But today, the Emperor was willing to let the issue be brought up in court again.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Eight Prince shifted his gaze to the retired Senior General Situ. He had retired nine years ago to his hometown and never set foot into Chang’an again due to his poor health. He had gained many injuries from the battlefield and it harmed him physically. However, this time, he did not heed to the Emperor’s persuasion and came to Chang’an. Now, he is standing in court with a serious expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span>Many of the military officers stared at Senior General SItu in admiration. They had to thank old General Situ for helping them get to their positions and ranks. The Emperor looked at him as well. </span></p>
 <p><span>When the Minister of the Right finished listing the Heir’s charges, people immediately started speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Your Highness, the Heir’s actions have caused many problems to our kingdom and the implications are huge. He had lost his honour as the Heir. Please punish him severely.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Emperor suddenly smiled. “My officials, your information seems to be very up-to-date. I’d just announced this issue today morning, but some of you had already written to me to depose the Heir as early as a few days ago. Come, tell me. How do you all know of this issue and how was it that the reasons all of you gave were different. All of you are really very capable, it seems.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The Eight Prince’s heart sank when he heard the words of the &nbsp;. He might have lost another chance to depose the Heir. The officials that spoke just now kept quiet too. No one dared to say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Tell me!” the Emperor slammed the table.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>Meanwhile, Feng Luodi was accompanying Situ. She was very nervous. Situ gently blew his tea and looked at Feng Luodi calmly. He didn’t understand why she was so agitated and kept pacing about the room.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What are you worried about?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi stopped in her track and rushed towards Situ. “Will the Emperor agree to depose the Heir?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ looked up at her. “Do you wish for him to be deposed?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was stunned for a second. The image of a high-spirited Jiang Moyin flashed through her mind. However, it was quickly replaced by her worry for Situ’s safety. “Tell me the truth, are there a lot of people who want to kill you?” Feng Luodi got serious.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Thousands,” Situ casually sipped his tea, “maybe even more than that.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“You have that many enemies?” Feng Luodi frowned, “I mean your personality is quite irritating sometimes, but that is a lot of enemies, even for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes?” Situ raised his eyebrows and smiled at Feng Luodi, “the Huns and many other countries are all dying to take my life. Isn’t that a lot of people?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi snatched his teacup and grunted, “Are you trying to evade the topic? Fine, not a sip of alcohol for you today.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ shrugged. “I can’t drink it anyway.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was in low-spirits and sat down holding her forehead. Why did she feel that they became weird after they let known their love for each other?</span></p>
 <p><span>“There is a lantern festival a few days later, do you want to go?” Situ poured another cup of tea and passed it to Feng Luodi.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was even more depressed. She felt that she was always on the losing end nowadays, never able to weasel information out of Situ anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Won’t you be very busy after your ‘recovery’?” Feng Luodi purposely accented her words, “I have to continue finding the other GUqin. I have only found six of them.” She suddenly became speechless after she finished her sentence. Her hand stopped moving and she did not dare to look at Situ.</span></p>
 <p><span>Yes, even though she’d agreed to stay by his side, she did not give up finding the remaining Guqin. She was in love, but she was still logical and knew that her goal was to go back to the 21st Century. Hence, she decided to be selfish one last time and get together with Situ. </span></p>
 <p><span>But she would not marry him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ knew this as well and that’s why they’d shunned away from talking about marriage. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Luodi.” Situ’s voice sounded.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi sat up straight an stared at him blankly, still deep in her thoughts. “Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“You still haven’t told me if you want to go to the lantern festival.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huh?”</span></p>
