 <p>Chapter 88 Remembrance: Smoke and Mirrors</p>
 <p>Situ and General An exchanged a look upon hearing Li Hengba's statement. Situ raised an eyebrow.</p>
 <p>"If that is the case, wouldn't you be a suspect as well?"</p>
 <p>Li Hengba shook his head repeatedly, his face a mask of innocence and confusion. "How can that be! Although he is indeed a spy working for the royal family of the Huns, he's definitely not one of mine; I never let my spies use the tattoo. After all, it defeats the entire purpose of sending out a covert spy, doesn't it?"</p>
 <p>General An nodded. "You are right indeed, Third Prince. Who do you think sent this spy, then?"</p>
 <p>Li Hengba smiled. "Well, now that's a tough question to answer, General An. This is just my hypothesis, and my guess is as good as any." His gaze swept over Feng Luodi, but it did not go unnoticed by Situ beside him. "Most of my royal brothers back in the kingdom are without ambition, their lives bent on enjoying the benefits that come with their royal status. But my half-brother is different from them - his blood does put him in an awkward position at times, but it also gives him access to resources from both sides. He seems to be the most suspicious of all, in my opinion."</p>
 <p>"Are you saying that this spy was sent by our Third Prince of the Xianbei?" General An was deep in thought.</p>
 <p>"Like I said, it's just a wild guess. Take it with a pinch of salt, General An." Li Hengba shook his hand again. "If there isn't anything else for me, I'll head off for breakfast now then. You can approach me for help again anytime you need; I'll be glad to do so."</p>
 <p>"Thank you for your help today morning then, Third Prince." General An bowed.</p>
 <p>Li Hengba nodded, and shot a look at Situ. When he passed Feng Luodi, he stopped and turned to her, curiosity in his eyes. "May I have your name, young miss?"</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi was taken aback for a second but quickly recovered. "My name is of no importance."</p>
 <p>"How can that be! A woman that follows General Situ around is definitely one with distinguished abilities and status!"</p>
 <p>From the corner of his eye, General An saw Situ's face change. It was the same look he wore to battle; he was looking at Li Hengba as if he was already dead.</p>
 <p>"I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you then, Master Li. I am but a simple woman." Feng Luodi shook her hand at Situ, asking him to leave the situation to her, out of view from Li Hengba. Situ's face relaxed somewhat. General An was surprised at their interaction.</p>
 <p>"Don't you know that I am the Third Prince of the Huns?" Li Hengba wore his usual smile, but it made Feng Luodi downright uncomfortable. "Why do you still address me as 'Master'?"</p>
 <p>"It is exactly because you are the Third Prince of the Huns that I will only address you as Master Li." A huge smile blossomed on her face. "You see, I am from the Xuan kingdom, and I will only address the royalty of my kingdom with honorifics."</p>
 <p>A light flashed in his eyes, but Li Hengba quickly hid his anger at her words. "I see I wouldn't be able to learn your name then. So be it." He turned and sauntered out of the courtyard.</p>
 <p>As soon as he was out of earshot, Feng Luodi turned to Situ. "How did I do? Was I brave enough?"</p>
 <p>"You were." Situ nodded, his lips curling upwards into a smile. <i>Only now does she act like someone her age.</i></p>
 <p>General An smiled as well. "You faced him confidently, Miss Feng."</p>
 <p>Now Feng Luodi was embarrassed. "My apologies, please continue with your discussions."</p>
 <p>General An nodded and turned to Situ. "General Situ, what do you think of his words?"</p>
 <p>Situ did not hesitate. "None of it was true. If you do need my help, General An, I can figure him out for you."</p>
 <p>"It'll be best if you could assist me, General Situ!" General An was pleased. "I'll put up a front and conduct an investigation on the Third Prince of Xianbei, just as Li Hengba had wanted me to do."</p>
 <p>"A wise decision."</p>
 <p>"I believe that General Situ and Miss Feng have not had your breakfast, have you?" With the Crown Prince gone, General An had taken up the role of the host. "Would you like to have it in the antechamber or sent to your courtyard?"</p>
 <p>"Please deliver it to your courtyard, then. My thanks, General An. We shall take our leave." Situ nodded at General An and headed out of the courtyard. Feng Luodi bowed at the general as well and quickly followed.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi voiced her doubts as they slowly walked back to their courtyard. "How do you intend to help General An? Also, wouldn't it reflect badly on you if you meddle in their affairs? You're a general of the Xuan kingdom, after all."</p>
 <p>"I don't care." Perhaps because he had heard such comments before, Situ's voice was tinged with annoyance.</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry." Feng Luodi sensed his annoyance and she quickly apologised. "I shouldn't have asked."</p>
 <p>"I…" Situ opened his mouth to explain himself, but saw that Feng Luodi had already directed her attention elsewhere. He swallowed his words back into his stomach, feeling frustration rise up within him. <i>This woman! Why is her attitude towards me so fickle and unpredictable? I can't do anything about it!</i></p>
 <p>"By the way," Feng Luodi said, "I've got to return to Chang'an when we're done with this wedding of the Xianbei. My mother has sent word from home, asking me to return to spend time with the Second Lady. She would be close to eight months pregnant by the time I'm back in the capital."</p>
 <p>The frustration within him boiled. <i>Is she going back already? But I haven't made any progress yet! </i>"Alright, I understand. I'll have to return to report to the Emperor as well." His face was a mask of calm.</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi nodded and kept mum. A silent tension slowly came between the two of them.</p>
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
 <p>General An was indeed efficient, quickly launching a huge investigation into the daily activities and schedules of the Third Prince and his men. Of course, his actions were facilitated and aided by the political enemies of the prince, eager to put down their opponent. Meanwhile, General An quietly hinted at times to the prince that the clues and leads were provided by Li Hengba, pitting the two of them against one another.</p>
 <p>Of course, the other princes gladly stood by and watched the drama unfold. While putting up a pretence in front of the ailing King to hunt for the murderer, they secretly roped in the original followers and supporters of the Crown Prince to join their side. After all, what better time is there to start the fight for power?</p>
 <p>Feng Luodi had nothing to do with all of that, and spent her days in the courtyard bored out of her wits. Her thoughts frequently wandered to the Guqin, Remembrance, yet to be played in Yunzhong Pass, and to her family and friends back in the capital. One day, she saw a man garbed in dark clothes and shrouded by a cape enter the room Situ used as his study, led by one of the Covert Guards.</p>
 <p><i>Why does that man…remind me of the Crown Prince? </i>Feng Luodi was perplexed. <i>But didn't he died in the assassination attempt? I saw the body myself! The preparations for his burial are already in place, and many of his original supporters have already abandoned ship. But…he does remind me a lot of the Crown Prince. I wonder why that is so?</i></p>
 <p>Feng Luodi rubbed her eyes. <i>Was I mistaken…or does the Crown Prince have a twin? Or…did he not die from that assassination attempt? If that was indeed true, this would be a huge trap that involves the entire country, with everyone here as a piece in the game. But…what role does Situ play in this 'game'? He seems to know much more than he lets on…at least, that's the feeling I can from him. Argh, what a mysterious man.</i></p>
 <p><i>So dangerous, yet so mesmerising.</i></p>
 <p>She returned to her room and paced around the limited space, bored out of her wits. She swore she could feel mushrooms growing on top of her head with the lack of action she has been getting. <i>Oh, how I miss those days when I'd first arrived in Chang'an! The investigation of the murder at Moonglade was such an enriching and interesting affair. And not to mention the case of the poisoned statue…</i></p>
 <p><i>Argh, how I wish I could have the answers to the murder right now. I want to know who killed the Crown Prince and the attendant…and their motives for doing so!</i></p>
 <p>Quattor sat on the roof, sighing as he looked down upon Feng Luodi. <i>I'm pretty sure Miss Feng saw everything just now…the General does entrust all his secrets to her, doesn't he?</i></p>
 <p>When it was time for dinner, Feng Luodi could not hold in her curiosity anymore.</p>
 <p>"Did the Crown Prince really die?"</p>
 <p>Situ nodded. "He's dead."</p>
 <p>"Oh…" Feng Luodi was a little disappointed. <i>Perhaps I was mistaken just now; Situ wouldn't lie to me anyway.</i></p>
 <p>Situ did not question her intention, and the rest of dinner was spent in silence.</p>
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
 <p>The next day, Li Hengba requested to be released from the residence, despite having proven to be very cooperative during the investigation.</p>
 <p>"There are some matters that require my attention back in my kingdom, and I will have to head back immediately." That was his reason, his expression filled with anxiety.</p>
 <p>General An shot a look at Situ, and turned to bow at Li Hengba. "My apologies, Third Prince. The murderer of the Crown Prince has yet to be found; I will not be able to account to the King if I was to let you leave just like that."</p>
