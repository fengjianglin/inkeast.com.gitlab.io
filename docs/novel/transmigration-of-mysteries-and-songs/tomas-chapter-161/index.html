 <p><span>Chapter 161 Green Vines: The Demonic Sect Supremo</span></p>
 <p><span>"No way! The Supremo would break my legs if I even suggest changing the name of our sect!" Lu Buping strolled out from the prison and sat in a pavilion, snacking as he sipped on tea. He was enjoying himself, but his words were firm.</span></p>
 <p><span>The First Prince was worried by the situation but did his best to convince and warn the civilians of the impending chaos. Of course, it was all part of a show for the Shadow Guards in the shadows, watching their every move. Meanwhile, Feng Luodi tried to convince Lu Buping for the Demonic Sect to change their name. She sat not far away from Lu Buping, idling playing with a cup in her hands, trying to come up with as many reasons as she could. Situ sat on the vermillion bannister surrounding the pavilion, his back to the pillar and a flask of wine in his hands, his eyes watching the lake calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lu Buping watched Situ expressionlessly, the latter looking even more unrestrained and free than the men of the </span><i><span>jianghu</span></i><span>, despite being an important general on the battlefield. He turned back to Feng Luodi and repeated himself again.</span></p>
 <p><span>"No way. Even putting aside the issue of convincing the Supremo, the 'Demonic Sect' sounds so cool and powerful! Is there ever a reason for us to change it?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Two hundred thousand soldiers." Situ spoke up, his words cryptic to Lu Buping.</span></p>
 <p><span>"What soldiers?" Lu Buping turned to look at the calm Situ. </span><i><span>I never knew men like that existed; his every action is so eye-catching!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi found it weird that Lu Buping kept staring at Situ, but continued to convince Lu Buping. "If the Demonic Sect does not change its name, his Highness would have to abide by the Imperial Decree and command the two hundred thousand soldiers of the Central Army to attack the sect. In the face of the army, the martial art skills of the sect members can't be of much use."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hmph! What Imperial Decree is that! How can the Emperor only listen to such rumours, how foolish of him!" Lu Buping spoke without hesitation, shoving a piece of dessert into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi froze for a second, quickly glancing around. Upon confirming that the area was indeed guarded by the Covert Guards, she quickly returned to her task. "You can't blame the Emperor for this. It is obvious that the Demonic Sect is being set up! Both his Highness and Situ are looking to avoid such bloodshed; if we can avoid conflict just by changing the name of the sect, why not?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Mockery graced the lips of Lu Buping. "You have quite the gift of the gab, don't you? Tell me, then: can your words represent the intentions of the First Prince and this great general here? If I bring you to see the Supremo, can you promise that the Demonic Sect will not be dragged into the dirty dealings of the royalty?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was speechless. After all, Lu Buping's worries were very much a probability.</span></p>
 <p><span>"She can," Situ spoke up. His eyes met the surprised expression of Lu Buping and he repeated himself, slowly. "She can represent both his Highness and me. Is this guarantee enough?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Lu Buping's expression slowly turned sombre. Feng Luodi suddenly thought to herself</span><i><span>. The men of the jianghu have their pride, and so does Situ. Are the two of them going to clash because of that</span></i><span>?</span></p>
 <p><span>Just as Feng Luodi was about to defuse the situation, Lu Buping burst out in laughter. The sound was joyful and boisterous, sending the birds above them flying away in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span>"I like that personality. Alright then!" Lu Buping suddenly had a change of attitude towards Situ. He slammed a hand onto the stone table, respect apparent in his eyes. "I'll bring you to the Supremo, but the job of convincing is on you. Tsk, she has a temper to behold."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was about to be relieved at her successful persuasion, but Lu Buping's words quickly made her nervous again. </span><i><span>A Supremo with a bad temper? </span></i><span>An image of an old man with a magnificent beard and unruly appearance, topped with erratic behaviour immediately formed in her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span>The three were all of a decisive nature, and they quickly left the yamen through the side gates, heading straight for the more prosperous streets in Dingtao City. To prevent the Shadow Guards of the Emperor finding out about his release, Lu Buping covered himself with a cloak and masked his features. Members of the Covert Guard trailed behind to guard against the Shadow Guards.</span></p>
 <p><span>Following behind Lu Buping, the trio darted and circled their way through the alleys and streets of Dingtao. Finally, after crossing countless streets, they stopped in front of a ubiquitous courtyard. As Lu Buping stepped forward to knock on the door in a specific rhythm, Feng Luodi could not hold her question any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Is your Supremo someone with really such a bad temper?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Naturally, she was going to be the one carrying out her proposal. Situ did not stop her, even if he did not fully understand her reasons for doing so. She did not want the blame to fall on Situ if the plan fails. That way, the relationship between the First Prince and Situ will not sour.</span></p>
 <p><span>Before Lu Buping could answer her question, the door opened and the man behind it quickly greeted Lu Buping, bowing as he did so.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Greetings, Protector."</span></p>
 <p><span>The man was courteous and respectful, and looked like a normal person. </span><i><span>They don't seem like what the rumours say. </span></i><span>Feng Luodi was surprised, but Situ recognized that the man was well versed in the martial arts, perhaps only a little weaker than Lu Buping himself.</span></p>
 <p><span>The follower led the way into the courtyard, not asking a single word about the identities of Feng Luodi and Situ. </span><i><span>The rules of the Demonic Sect must be really strict! What can I do if the Supremo rejects my proposition?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Lu Buping suddenly stopped and darted back to stand beside Feng Luodi. "You were asking me about the Supremo's temper, right?" He laughed dramatically. "Hah! &nbsp;She's one crazy woman! You have to be careful when you see her!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Crazy woman? The Supremo of the sect is a woman?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Just as Feng Luodi was surprised, she felt Situ's arm snake around her waist and the two of them glided backwards swiftly. Then, a bright and ringing laughter akin to the sound of bells rang through the courtyard, the energy in the sound making her uncomfortable. Quickly, Situ's hands covered her ears. Feng Luodi could no longer hear, but she saw as a red sash flew through the room before them towards Lu Buping. Just as it was about to wrap itself around the man, Lu Buping darted away. Then came a flurry of movements as the sash chased after Lu Buping in the courtyard. </span><i><span>What! Lu Buping is on the losing end?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Situ released his hands and Feng Luodi heard a soft yet commanding voice ring through the courtyard. "Lu Buping, you useless chap! Didn't you get captured in prison? Come over here, and let your Supremo have a look at your sorry state!" The voice was very young.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi stared at the source of the voice. The young woman was dressed in red from head to toe, the layers of red sash wrapping themselves around her body, exposing much of her fair skin to the air. Her eyes were bright and her teeth white, her features adorned by red lips and a single speck of red between her eyebrows. She was three parts seduction and seven parts dominating. She was the Supremo of the Demonic Sect, Shangguan Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi was genuinely surprised. </span><i><span>I never knew that the women of this age are allowed to dress so seductively!</span></i><span> Immediately, she whipped her head around to check the expression on Situ's face, only to see him concentrating on Lu Buping's tussle with the red sash, the other end held in the hands of Shangguan Yan. Obviously, Shangguan Yan had imbued the sash with her </span><i><span>neigong, </span></i><span>transforming it into a weapon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>She must be skilled in martial arts. </span></i><span>Feng Luodi's interest was piqued.</span></p>
 <p><span>When Lu Buping finally untangled himself from the sash, a layer of sweat had already beaded his forehead. Lu Buping scrunched his face helplessly as he turned towards Shangguan Yan. "Supremo, </span><i><span>your Scarlet Silk</span></i><span><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span><span>&nbsp;has greatly improved, huh?"</span></p>
 <p><span>A dazzling smile shone on Shangguan Yan's face. "It's useless to praise me. Look at what you've done! You've fallen into the traps of others, and now I have to clean up after you."</span></p>
 <p><span>"I don't need to be saved!" Lu Buping pointed a finger at Feng Luodi and Situ. "I'm setting a trap for them as well, and these are my partners!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Finally, Shangguan Yan took a good look at Situ and Feng Luodi, her gaze settling on Feng Luodi. Before Feng Luodi could react, Shangguan Yan was already right in front of her, reaching a hand out to lift her chin.</span></p>
 <p><span>"This girl is pretty. Buping, where did you abduct her from?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Before her hand could touch Feng Luodi, the latter had already moved backwards with Situ. His eyes were dark and his tone icy. "She's mine</span><i><span>." Nobody touches her.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Shangguan Yan pursed her lips in disdain. "How petty."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi blinked</span><i><span>. Her temper doesn't seem to be that bad…</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Before she could continue with that train of thought, Shangguan Yan appeared in front of Lu Buping, sending a fist in his direction.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Weren't you trying to woo Qi'er? And now you're after another girl again! When will you ever learn from your mistakes?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi watch open-mouthed as Lu Buping got whopped by a young girl. Finally, when Lu Buping can no longer beg for mercy, Situ threw a rock in the direction of the two, stopping Shangguan Yan in her tracks.</span></p>
 <p><span>She turned to look at Situ in disdain. "Who are you? What does it have to do with you when I'm lecturing my follower?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ ignored her and merely looked at Lu Buping. "Business first."</span></p>
 <p><span>Lu Buping rubbed his swollen face. "Supremo, let's change the name of our sect."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Hmmm?" Shangguan Yan raised her fist again, but Feng Luodi quickly stopped her.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Uhm, Supremo Shangguan?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Shangguan Yan frowned as she looked at Feng Luodi, waiting for her to speak. Quickly, Feng Luodi explained the situation and their proposal. Shangguan Yan laughed derisively.</span></p>
 <p><span>"What about two hundred thousand soldiers? They're but nothing to me. The 'Demonic Sect' is such a nice name; I'm not going to change it."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi's heart fell. Although she'd anticipated failure, but it did not help the feeling of helplessness that overwhelmed her when it happened. Indeed, it would be seen as a disgrace for a sect to change its name in the </span><i><span>jianghu, </span></i><span>much less to ask that of the maverick of them all?</span></p>
 <p><i><span>What was I thinking? </span></i></p>
