<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Feng Luodi had been confined in the court prison for two days already.</p> 
 <p>In those two days, Feng Luodi hadn’t drunk a drop of water.</p> 
 <p>The prison guard naturally didn’t dare to carelessly subject her to torture or prevent her from eating and drinking. After all, from that supreme person’s perspective, it was more useful to keep Feng Luodi rather than dead.</p> 
 <p>The court prison was indeed dark and damp. Inside the cell that Feng Luodi was staying in, there was only a bed built by laying stones with a thin layer of rice straw on top, and a few hundred feet above it was a small window. The light that was projected into the cell was pathetic.</p> 
 <p>It was summertime. The damp and sultry prison cell emanated a strange smell and when it assailed one’s nose, it caused them to vomit.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi half leaned against the wall. Her eyes slightly trailed upwards as she gazed at that window that was totally out of her reach, ignoring the voices of the prison guards outside.</p> 
 <p>The smile that hung on her lips, from when she recalled her past memories, had long stiffened.</p> 
 <p>She didn’t dare to imagine what Situ was doing outside. <em>Being put in such a difficult spot, that person is bound to be extremely distressed.</em></p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi had long made up her mind. No matter what Situ chose, she would have no complaints. Regardless of whether he picked his great undertaking or her, she was fine with both. She didn’t need Situ to make a dangerous move for her sake. <em>He had never been threatened before, he must be feeling very vexed and his heart must be boiling with anger right now…</em></p> 
 <p>“Are you planning to go on a hunger strike and die in order to help that person make a choice?”</p> 
 <p>A cold voice with no shred of emotion suddenly sounded.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi’s gaze shifted slightly. It was Phantom who hadn’t appeared for about a year now. He was still clad in black robes and his face was as pale as before. The look in his eyes was the same cold, seemingly not permitting a single ray of light to penetrate them.</p> 
 <p>Phantom was originally only able to appear in the realm of spirits but he had now appeared before her eyes.</p> 
 <p>“So it turns out that you can appear in the form of a human.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi looked past Phantom and saw the prison guard in a deep slumber near them.</p> 
 <p>“As a Grim Reaper, there are times when it is necessary to turn into a human,” Phantom replied methodically. He slowly walked closer to Feng Luodi and stopped a few metres away from her. He furrowed his eyebrows as he sized up the environment of the prison cell. Then, his gaze landed on Feng Luodi’s blanched lips.</p> 
 <p>“You still haven’t answered my question.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi straightened her body a little and sized up Phantom with interest as a smile blossomed on her face. She didn’t look like someone who was subjected to a death sentence at all.</p> 
 <p>“You indeed have the bearing of a human when you are in this form. If you’re willing to dab a little rouge on your face to add a little more colour, you will look even more like one.”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t use those things that you humans use.”</p> 
 <p>Phantom remained scrupulous and methodical as usual. He seemed to have thought of something and a trace of gentleness flickered across his eyes, which quickly disappeared again.</p> 
 <p>“Answer my question.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi was seemingly annoyed as she rubbed the space between her eyebrows. The smile tugged at her lips hadn’t diminished one bit and her tone was gentle, making it hard for one to discern her emotions.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you already know?” she asked in response. She was seemingly recalling some memories.</p> 
 <p>“I have always thought that making a decision is very tough. I didn’t dare to think about it before. If there comes a day when I have found all the ten zithers, will I choose to return to my parents’ side or remain at Situ’s side? However, at this moment, I finally don’t need to make a decision anymore. Before I have found the ten zithers, for the Feng Residence and Situ’s sake, I can no longer stay in this world. Now that I think about it, this is the best option. No matter if it’s towards my parents or Situ, I don’t need to assume the responsibility for anything in the end.”</p> 
 <p>“Did you know? I have never expected that I would be able to live my life once more and meet Situ along the way. Do I even have the right to accompany him by his side? As for him, he should be a free and unrestrained hero who gallops in the prairie, and a hero shouldn’t be bound by anything.”</p> 
 <p>There were no changes in expression on Phantom’s cold face, making it hard for her to guess his thoughts. But his thoughts were seemingly contained in his words.</p> 
 <p>“I can directly tell you where Sonorous is. As long as you are able to leave this prison cell, you will find all the ten zithers and you can make a choice when the time comes.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi’s eyes widened at the mention of this. She was stupefied for a moment before she chuckled and continued, “Phantom, are you concerned about me? This is really unexpected.”</p> 
 <p>Phantom’s tone remained indifferent as he said, “No, I’m merely hoping that you can complete the mission in time so that I can report back to the higher-ups.”</p> 
 <p>“I see.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi’s voice became softer as she murmured, “In that case, I’m afraid that I’ll have to disappoint you. I won’t be able to complete the mission anymore.”</p> 
 <p>Phantom furrowed and there was finally a slight change in his expression. After a moment of silence, he finally said, “You have to believe in that person. He’ll rescue you and take you away from this place.”</p> 
 <p>“Of course I believe in him.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi smiled again, but there was a bland look in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>“He’s an omnipotent person but I can’t be this selfish. He shouldn’t be burdened with infamy. The Situ Family has been loyal officials through generations and they also needn’t bear a bad name.”</p> 
 <p>“It’s merely reputation. All those are just gimmicks to show their fealty. He wouldn’t mind.”</p> 
 <p>Phantom was insistent on persuading Feng Luodi to keep on living and not to give up.</p> 
 <p>“He doesn’t mind but I mind.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi suddenly raised her head and looked straight into Phantom’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>“I have always been making selfish decisions but just this once, I can’t be selfish. As long as the Emperor doesn’t make things difficult for him this time, Situ can definitely resolve everything before the Emperor executes his next plan. The First Prince will be the new emperor, Situ will be a meritorious subject that has rendered outstanding service and I won’t be his burden. Everything will take a turn for the better.”</p> 
 <p>“This isn’t what he wants though.”</p> 
 <p>Phantom remained persistent. Feng Luodi, on the other hand, was stunned by his persistence. But, at this moment, she didn’t think too much into it.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll tell you now where Sonorous is.”</p> 
 <p>Silence hung over the prison cell. Feng Luodi lowered her head and looked down while she stared into space. Not far away, the mice that were scuttling around had carelessly bumped into Phantom and were instantly frozen into ice sculptures. The stifling hot prison cell was instantly as cold as a winter day and coldness spread everywhere.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi raised her head in astonishment, but what caught her attention next was the voice of the Head Minister, resounding from outside.</p> 
 <p>“What’s with this prison guard? He’s already sleeping in broad daylight. It’s because I’ve failed to discipline them. Gentleman Jiang, please don’t mind this.”</p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to be polite. I don’t hold an official post anymore so you don’t need to use honorifics in front of me.”</p> 
 <p>“Haha, Gentleman Jiang sure is polite.”</p> 
 <p>“It’s Elder Brother’s voice.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi was stunned. She immediately felt the cold in the prison cell dissipate. When she glanced back, Phantom had already disappeared into thin air and only left a few words regarding Sonorous’ whereabouts behind.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi didn’t know what expression to show in front of her Elder Brother.</p> 
 <p>While she was still in a daze, the Head Minister already led Jiang Moyin to the prison cell.</p> 
 <p>Jiang Moyin was still as gaunt as before, as if he was unable to withstand a single blow and looked like he would collapse at any moment. His gaze swept across Feng Luodi who had slimmed down quite a bit and his bliss turned into rage in an instant. Then, when he inspected the environment of the prison cell, a chilly aura started to spread from his body.</p> 
 <p>This imposing aura startled the Head Minister and he hastily lowered his head.</p> 
 <p>“I’m really apologetic about this. Everything was done according to His Majesty’s instructions. I had no choice but to comply. I’ll go and wait outside the prison. Gentleman Jiang, if you have anything to tell Miss Feng, please feel free to do so.”</p> 
 <p>When he was done speaking, he hastily ran out, not daring to stay there a minute longer.</p> 
 <p>“Elder Brother, you shouldn’t have come.”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi sighed. She slowly walked closer to Jiang Moyin with the wooden bars of the prison cell separating them. However, she suddenly felt a wave of dizziness which made her slightly unsteady.</p> 
 <p>Jiang Moyin reached out his hand. When he realised that he was unable to touch Feng Luodi, the anger was apparent on his face.</p> 
 <p>“Call me Moyin. For the remaining days, you have to call me Moyin.”</p> 
 <p>This was the first time he had shown such an unyielding attitude.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi stared at him with a surprised look on her face. She then broke into a smile.</p> 
 <p>“Moyin, it’s better that you go back. This place isn’t suitable for you.”</p> 
 <p>Jiang Moyin’s expression didn’t ease one bit. He always had a gentle countenance so his current solemn and cold appearance felt extremely unfamiliar to her.</p> 
 <p>He took out the food box and passed the food inside. He then slowly spoke in tone repressed with emotions, “It’s my second time coming to the court prison.”</p> 
 <p>The first time was because he had no choice but to send that person off, and consequently he’d sent away his whole life’s great undertaking.</p> 
 <p>This time, he came to see the one person he couldn’t bear to part from. She was someone that he was definitely not willing to send off.</p> 
 <p>Resoluteness flashed in his light brown eyes. It was a resoluteness that was unafraid of death.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, what entered Feng Luodi’s eyes was Jiang Moyin’s white clothes.</p> 
 <p>“You shouldn’t go on a hunger strike. Everyone is thinking of a solution. You can’t give up first.”</p> 
 <p>What followed was a tone that sternly chided her.</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi slowly squatted and stared at the food. She blinked and said, “I didn’t expect this news to be spread out so fast. His Majesty is doing this on purpose. He’s really sly and despicable.”</p> 
 <p>Jiang Moyin’s expression remained stern.</p> 
 <p>“He is very sly. It’s right for you to not eat the food here. No one knows if he would resort to poisoning the food and use the antidote as a threat after you’ve been rescued.”</p> 
 <p>The smile tugged at Feng Luodi’s lips froze. She hadn’t thought about this at all. <em>So it turns out that the Emperor not only went as far as to use a woman to threaten Situ, but he would stoop so low as to use a despicable move like adding poison. Goodness, the hands of a supreme person sure are dirty.</em></p> 
 <p>“But, you have to eat obediently from now on.” Jiang Moyin used his most stern and most earnest tone and added, “I’ll let people send food here every day. You must keep on living. We will rescue you.”</p> 
 <p>An immense sense of uneasiness suddenly welled up in Feng Luodi’s heart. *Such a Jiang Moyin seems very unfamiliar and distant.</p> 
 <p>“Elder Brother?”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi suddenly grabbed Jiang Moyin’s hand.</p> 
 <p>Jiang Moyin stopped what he was doing and raised his eyes slightly to look at Feng Luodi. He emphasised, “Moyin.”</p> 
 <p>“What are you going to do? What are you planning to do?”</p> 
 <p>Feng Luodi finally panicked. She suddenly thought of Situ.</p> 
 <p>“What is Situ planning to do? Don’t let him come to the court prison, don’t him err, don’t make me selfish…”</p> 
 <p>In the end, she was imploring in a sobbing tone.</p> 
 <p>The people she treasured the most. The people she couldn’t bear to let go. She didn’t want them to take any risks.</p> 
 <p>“This isn’t you being selfish.” Jiang Moyin in turn grabbed Feng Luodi’s hand. This was his first time holding Feng Luodi’s hand and it would also be his last time.</p> 
 <p>“We are the ones who are too selfish. We are the ones who thought too highly of ourselves. We shouldn’t have implicated you in all of this.”</p> 
 <p>“Rest assured. What you’re worried about won’t happen. Both Situ and I have the ability to solve these matters. You only need to behave well and stay here. Eat your meals properly and rest properly. We will take you out together. This is our promise so you can’t renege on it first.”</p> 
 <p>“Moyin.”</p> 
 <p>Tears were already glistening in Feng Luodi’s eyes as she called out to him.</p> 
 <p>“Could you please tell me? Tell me, what exactly are you guys planning to do?”</p>
