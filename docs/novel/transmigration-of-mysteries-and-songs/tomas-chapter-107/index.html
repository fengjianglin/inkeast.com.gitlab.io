 <p><span>Chapter 107 Cloud Nine: Krptonite</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Everyone in the world is born equal; no one deserves to lord over anyone else. </span></i><span>That is the worldview that Feng Luodi believes in. </span><i><span>Everyone has pride; everyone deserves respect.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>The moment she saw Liu Shang and Chu Xiaoxiao in the street, she knew trouble was coming for her. Not wanting to cause trouble for the Feng household, she could only do her best to comply with her demands. However, when she finally realized the fact that they weren't going to let her off so easily, obviously bent on making her day hell, she let out a breath she had been holding.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Everyone was wrong. Father, elder brother, you guys have no idea how vicious and jealous women can get.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi looked at the two women in the room as calmly as she could. "Why do you have stoop so low, doing such things to me? I pity you, of noble birth yet despised by the attendants who serve you. They smile and honour your wishes before you, but can barely suppress their urge to slap you when you turn your backs to them. It must be tough to live a life like that."</span></p>
 <p><span>"You!" Princess Shangrong glared at her, her face livid with anger. She screamed at the two guards in the room. "Why are you not restraining her yet? Can't you see her disrespect towards me?" The two guards quickly hurried forward and held Feng Luodi in a strong grip. A strong kick to her knees sent her to her knees.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Raise her head." Princess Shangrong commanded. A guard forcefully lifted Feng Luodi's head, holding her chin tightly between his fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi smiled. "You must have waited a long time to do this. What good patience you have."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Shut up!" Chu Xiaoxiao snarled, dousing Feng Luodi on the head with a goblet of wine. </span><i><span>How dare she say that of me! How dare she speak to me like that!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi blinked, the wine dripping onto the floor from her chin. She chuckled. "Smells like Autumnal Ombre. Delicious, isn't it?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Xiaoxiao tossed another goblet of wine onto her. "Do you want more?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Strangely, rage no longer showed on the face of the princess. She watched coldly as Chu Xiaoxiao expended her fury on Feng Luodi, and at Feng Luodi who held the same mocking smile on her face. Princess Shangrong smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span>"What is it that you most fear?" Princess Shangrong's smile was innocent, but her words dripped with venom. "I love finding the kryptonite of my enemies and strike where it hurts the most. That's just like the Duke of Anping, isn't it? I can take down all my enemies in one fell swoop."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi scoffed. "You must be kidding, right? Are you really trying to compare yourself, selfish and bratty as you are, to a general whose deeds are all done for the good of the kingdom?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Beat her up!" Chu Xiaoxiao raged at Feng Luodi's defiance, screaming at the palace guards who held Feng Luodi down. The guards hesitated, looking at the princess for confirmation.</span></p>
 <p><span>Princess Shangrong smiled. "No rush for that. Just as she said, let me be selfish for once. I want to find her weakness." She propped her head up with a slender finger, deep in thought. "Your looks are mediocre at best -- I'm sure it wouldn't matter much to you even if I was to disfigure you, would it? Chamberlain Feng is a 2nd Rank Official, a position that will take more than a little convincing from me for Father to remove him from his post. Your marriage is out of the question as well, after what happened in the Imperial Study that day."</span></p>
 <p><i><span>I've severely underestimated her; she's not the brat everyone had assumed her to be. </span></i><span>Feng Luodi remained expressionless, but deep inside she was surprised by the princess' logical deductions.</span></p>
 <p><span>The princess continued. "I remember Elder Brother Huaicai mentioning that you were looking for the 10 Guqin?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi's eyebrow twitched. </span><i><span>No.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Princess Shangrong smiled sweetly. "I'm sure you're looking for the Guqin so that you can play them, aren't you? Thinking of which, you really are skilled in music. It's rare for a woman to be known not for her looks or her birth, but for her musical talents. Aren't you a special little thing? I wonder what will happen…if I maim your hands?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi's face changed; she could not help the horrifying thought that raced through her mind. Princess Shangrong grinned smugly, pleased with her reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Xiaoxiao barked at the guards. "Do you know what to do now?"</span></p>
 <p><span>The guards turned to Princess Shangrong again, who nodded in glee. They pressed down on Feng Luodi, forcing her hands flat on the wooden floor. Princess Shangrong gestured to Chu Xiaoxiao.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Help yourself."</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Xiaoxiao stepped forward with malicious glee in her eyes. Scratching her long fingernails on Feng Luodi's face, she raised her leg high in the air and brought it down hard on Feng Luodi's knuckles.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Ahhh!" Feng Luodi shirked from the pain, but the guards held her firmly in place. Not satisfied with the pain she'd inflicted, Chu Xiaoxiao ground her heel into Feng Luodi's hand. Feng Luodi hissed loudly through her teeth, sweat beading her forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span>The owner's voice sounded from outside the dining room. "Is everything alright, your Highness? Is there anything I can do for you?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Princess Shangrong motioned for a guard to cup Feng Luodi's mouth tightly together as she hollered loudly. "Everything's fine; I'd just knocked my head by accident. You may leave. Guards, do not let anyone near the room without my command." Hearing her instructions, the palace guards standing watch outside the dining room quickly chased the owner away. The owner looked worriedly at the closed door of the dining room, but had no other choice except to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Let go of her mouth." Chu Xiaoxiao motioned to the guards. Taking a handkerchief from her waist, she balled it into a lump and shoved it into Feng Luodi's open mouth. "Now you can't make a sound."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Phleck!" Feng Luodi spat the handkerchief out of her mouth, mockery in her eyes as she looked back at Chu Xiaoxiao.</span></p>
 <p><span>"How dare you!" Chu Xiaoxiao screamed, slapping Feng Luodi hard on the cheek. "You don't seem to understand your current situation, do you?" She ground her heel into Feng Luodi's hand again.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi bit hard into her lower lip as she teared from the immense pain, refusing to show any signs of weakness. Glancing down, she could see where her hand was bleeding.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Not feeling satisfied yet, Xiaoxiao? Here, take this." Princess Shangrong handed a bowl of hot soup to Chu Xiaoxiao. Enjoying the look of fear in Feng Luodi's eyes, Chu Xiaoxiao dumped the bowl of soup onto her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span>"AHHHHH!" This time, Feng Luodi could not hold back her scream. Whipping her head back involuntarily, she sunk her teeth into Chu Xiaoxiao's arm.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Argh! Let go of me, you crazy woman!" Chu Xiaoxiao slapped Feng Luodi again, trying to free her hand from her jaws.</span></p>
 <p><span>"What are you doing? Help her!" Princess Shangrong shouted at the two guards. One of them struck Feng Luodi on her neck, causing her to open her mouth in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span>"You bitch!" Chu Xiaoxiao kicked Feng Luodi hard in the stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Here, take this to vent your anger." Princess Shangrong placed a dagger into Chu Xiaoxiao's hands. Chu Xiaoxiao laughed and bent down before Feng Luodi. Ignoring her struggles, she thrust the dagger deep into Feng Luodi's hands.</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi glanced down at her hands, bloodied and searing with hot pain. Tears clouding her vision, she gathered all the anger in her body and laughed at Chu Xiaoxiao. "Mark my words: you will not leave Chang'an unscathed."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Who do you think you are to stop me? Foolish commoner!" Chu Xiaoxiao snarled, her eyes bloodthirsty and cruel.</span></p>
 <p><span>She raised the dagger again, about to bring it down onto Feng Luodi's hands. The door burst flew inwards with a huge bang, bringing a cloud of dust as it unhinged from the frame.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Let go of her!" A voice bellowed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Situ? </span></i><span>Feng Luodi smiled weakly. </span><i><span>Why is he here so fast? Didn't Quattor return to him already? How did he know what was happening?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Duke of Anping?" Princess Shangrong and Chu Xiaoxiao were stunned by Situ's arrival.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ did not spare a look at them. He strode forward, sending the two guards flying to the far side of the room with two swift kicks. Catching her as she fell forward, he cradled her in his arms. "Everything is going to be okay; I'm here now."</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Luodi could not hold it in anymore. She buried her head into his chest and sobbed. </span><i><span>How many times has this happened before? He's always there for me when I need it most, but I reject him time and time again out of selfishness.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Situ looked down, the blood on Feng Luodi's lips and hands sending a sharp pain into his heart. He turned to Princess Shangrong and Chu Xiaoxiao, his eyes full of cold fury. "I shall remember this gift of yours to me; anticipate my gift in return."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Anping Duke! Please listen to me!" Princess Shangrong panicked, jabbing a finger in Chu Xiaoxiao's direction. "It was entirely her idea! She was the one who'd hurt Feng Luodi; I didn't do anything!"</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Xiaoxiao was shocked by the accusation. "Shang'er?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"Shut up!" Princess Shangrong screamed at her friend. She turned, frantically trying to grab hold of Situ's sleeve, who ignored her completely. Situ dashed out of the restaurant, not wanting to delay another second. Two stepped into the room and stood in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Your Highness, please remember your dignity as royalty."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Move away at once, you lowly commoner! How dare you stop me!" Princess Shangrong screamed hysterically.</span></p>
 <p><span>Two did not flinch. Slowly backing out of the room, he placed the door back onto its hinge and gave orders to the owner not to open it until an hour later. The bodies of the palace guards that stood watch outside the dining room lay on the floor, unmoving.</span></p>
 <p><span>Two walked out of Manchun Tang hurriedly, intending to send a physician to Situ's residence where Situ had brought Feng Luodi. He was quickly stopped by Jiang Moyin and Scarlet, hurrying towards the restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span>"How is Luodi?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Two bowed at Jiang Moyin. "Sir. Miss Feng's hands were badly injured; she is on her way to the General's residence as we speak. I am heading off to fetch a physician. Please head to the general's residence if you wish to do so."</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin nodded and turned to Scarlet. "Let's head to Situ's residence right now."</span></p>
 <p><span>They had barely taken a few steps when Jiang Moyin stopped in his tracks and doubled over, coughs racking his entire frame. When he lifted his hand from his mouth, blood glistened brightly in his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Grand Tutor, are you alright?" Scarlet panicked. "Why don't you return to your residence? I'll send word to you as soon as possible. I'm sure young miss will be fine with the Duke of Anping with her."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Don't worry about me." Jiang Moyin shook his head. "I can't rest without checking on Luodi."</span></p>
 <p><span>Quickly hiring a carriage from Manchun Tang, Scarlet helped Jiang Moyin into the cabin and the two quickly made their way to the Duke of Anping's residence.</span></p>
