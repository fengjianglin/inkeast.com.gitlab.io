 <p><span>Chapter 113 Cascades: Disappointment</span></p>
 <p><span>"This is too much! Even I was rejected at the gates; why are we barred from seeing Luodi, if she is only resting?" In a private room on the third floor of Manchun Tang, Qi Jianqiu voiced her displeasure loudly to the Four Gentlemen of Chang'an. Unfortunately for her, only Xue Yiqi paid her rant any attention; Situ sipped his tea solemnly, Jiang Moyin bent over as a cough wrecked his body and Gan Qingjia seemingly deep in thought about something else.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Perhaps the Feng household is overwhelmed by the number of guests these few days and the Chamberlain has no choice but to resort to this." Xue Yiqi comforted her as much as he could.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qi Jianqiu raised an eyebrow. "No way the Chamberlain has enough energy to even think of his daughter right now. Hmph! I'm going to find out what exactly is going on."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Maybe they'll let you in if you said you were visiting the Chamberlain."</span></p>
 <p><span>"I don't even want to see Fu Bo's patronising smile right now." Qi Jianqiu shook her head furiously. "What if...I climb the walls?"</span></p>
 <p><span>Her words triggered a memory within Situ. </span><i><span>It's been half a year since that day she'd climbed her wall to find me...things seemed so different back then.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"Have you not visited her?" Jiang Moyin turned to Situ.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ's hand tightened around his teacup, his face stoic. "Didn't even Miss Qi get rejected at the door?"</span></p>
 <p><span>"You really are patient, aren't you?" Jiang Moyin stuttered a little. His health has been deteriorating these days but still he attended he gathering, in the hopes of seeing Feng Luodi there as well. "It's not as if you don't know what she's like." The words came out of his mouth before he could stop them. "A month of not seeing her makes you as good as a stranger; she can be very cruel, sometimes."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ's eyes darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Are you guys talking about Luodi?" Qi Jianqiu caught a snippet of their conversation, puzzled by their comment about Feng Luodi. </span><i><span>Why will they say that about Luodi?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin laughed a little. "We were just a little surprised that you hadn't managed to get her out today; after all, our gatherings have been getting more and more infrequent."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Exactly! What a rare chance for all of us to gather again! Argh...I can't take this anymore. I'm going to the Feng household again." Qi Jianqiu jumped to her feet.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Miss Feng is indeed gravely ill; you will be rejected even if you go again." The uncharacteristically quiet Gan Qingjia spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span>"How do you know that?" Qi Jianqiu look at him suspiciously.</span></p>
 <p><span>"My father had a meeting with Chamberlain Feng a few days back and the Chamberlain mentioned Miss Feng's illness during their discussion. She has been instructed by the physician to rest and, specifically, to not involve herself in any matters other than resting."</span></p>
 <p><span>Qi Jianqiu looked at Gan Qingjia strangely, unaccustomed to this sombre side of him. She sat back down again, nodding as she bought his words. Mumbling to herself under her breath, her fingers played with the teacup in her hands. Situ's hands tightened around his cup.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Just go." Jiang Moyin smiled bitterly, looking at Situ. "I can't even if I want to."</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ took a deep breath and leapt to his feet. "I have some matters to attend to." Before the rest could react, he'd already disappeared from the dining room.</span></p>
 <p><span>"What is going on?" Xue Yiqi looked at Jiang Moyin, confusion written plainly on his face. However, Jiang Moyin ignored his question, cupping his hands around the cup of hot tea as if to warm himself.</span></p>
 <p><span>The room descended into silence, each of its occupants brooding in their own thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ frowned as he stood on the wall in the Feng residence looking into Feng Luodi's courtyard. </span><i><span>Why does the place look so empty? What happened here? </span></i><span>Fallen leaves littered the courtyard from obvious neglect, the doors to the few rooms in the courtyard tightly shut. The entire courtyard was an eerie silence.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ landed in the middle of the courtyard and took a deep breath. Hesitatingly, he walked towards Feng Luodi's room and pushed it open. The room was clean, but obviously already uninhabited for a few days</span><i><span>. Why does this feel so familiar to me? It's as if I'd always been afraid of this happening...that she would &nbsp;leave in silence one day, as cold as the distant look in her eyes when we first met.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>His heart ached with a sudden loss, but the sadness soon turned into rage. He stomped out of the room, flinging the door close in his wake. With a kick, he sent the stone table in the courtyard flying to the lone tree in the middle. In the midst of his tantrum, his eyes caught a special marking on the tree, a system of symbols used by his Covert Guards</span><i><span>. This must have been left by Duo; I'd almost forgot that he's now watching over her. </span></i><span>His eyes wandered around the courtyard. Striding, he picked up a small square of cloth hidden in the corner. Shaking fingers quickly unfolded the cloth and his eyes scanned through the message quickly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>"General. Miss Feng has suggested to isolate herself from the household, fearing that her sickness may be passed on to the newborn child. She is headed to the residential chalet owned by the Yushan Commandery Princess outside the city. I was unable to relay the message to you in time due to the sudden nature of her decision; please forgive my mistake." </span></i><span>The letter was dated the day before.</span></p>
 <p><span>Situ heaved a sigh of relief. </span><i><span>Everything is good as long as she's still here - even if she'd rejected me. </span></i><span>He laughed bitterly. </span><i><span>How long has it been since I'd had to put myself so low, much less for a woman?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></i></p>
 <p><span>The gathering at Manchun Tang ended soon after Situ's hasty departure, each of them seemingly troubled by matters unsolved. As the gathering ended, Jiang Moyin stood up and returned to his residence, accompanied by his attendant.</span></p>
 <p><span>He was greeted quickly by his head steward, Lu Bo. "Grand Tutor. We have word that the Heir has &nbsp;just promised to secure the future of the sons of another two officials today, in exchange for their allegiance."</span></p>
 <p><span>"What?" Jiang Moyin's face darkened. "Didn't I tell him not to do that already? Why is this happening again!"</span></p>
 <p><span>"What's wrong with that, Grand Tutor?" Lu Bo looked at Jiang Moyin, perplexed. "That is another two officials on the side of the Heir; surely they will be of use in the future."</span></p>
 <p><span>"His Majesty have always disliked it when his sons focus too much on forming alliances within court, wishing for them to be hardworking caring for the people instead. The Heir has been toeing that line too much as of late." Jiang Moyin felt helpless at what his liege was doing. "And that's not even considering the fact that such alliances forged with the promise of benefits are unreliable; these officials may fall to the other side anytime."</span></p>
 <p><span>"No wonder we've had word that the Emperor was enraged today." Lu Bo finally understood the gravity of the situation. "Seems like he's</span> <span>displeased at the Heir."</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin shook his head. "Get the carriage ready for me. I have to speak to the Heir."</span></p>
 <p><span>"At this time?" Lu Bo looked at the darkening sky. "The palace is almost closed now, Grand Tutor. It'll be troublesome for you to leave the palace later on."</span></p>
 <p><span>"I have to stop him before he does anything else!" Jiang Moyin wrapped himself in a heavy cloak handed to him by an attendant, jumped into the carriage and headed straight for the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
 <p><span>The Royal Palace, Residential Grounds of the Heir.</span></p>
 <p><span>"Is that what you're here for today, Grand Tutor?" The Heir sat at the head of the table, a cup of tea in his hands. His face no longer bore the respect he'd had for Jiang Moyin, and he no longer showed his concern about Jiang Moyin's health despite the cold weather. His previously warm and gentle features now seemed to emanate an aura of ruthlessness, a coldness akin to that of the previous 7th Prince.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin sighed inwardly. "Your Highness, I hope you have not forgotten the words of his Majesty."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Of course I remember Father's teachings." The Heir set the cup down. "It is exactly because he has not interfered with any of my actions that I continue to do this."</span></p>
 <p><span>"But no Emperor will blatantly restrict their sons from garnering power in court, your Highness." Jiang Moyin was tired, repeating the words he'd said many times before. "Your power grows everyday, but his Majesty has no intention to pass on the throne as of yet. Your actions will only serve to make him suspicious."</span></p>
 <p><span>"Are you not aware of the fact that I will ascend to the throne sooner or later, now that I am the Heir Apparent of the kingdom?" The Heir spoke arrogantly, seeming oblivious to the fact that his words are inherently treacherous.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin rubbed his temples. "Didn't his Majesty berate your Highness for not making any progress in the matter of the Villa of Mount Baicha just yesterday? If you indeed have the time on your hands, why not focus them on the tasks his Majesty has set out for you?"</span></p>
 <p><span>The Heir looked flustered by his words, but his eyes quickly turned cold. "Why, Grand Tutor? Are you here to mock me today? I do not need your reminder to know what to do. After all, you're nothing but a mere Tutor of courtly conduct and mannerisms; I do not need you making decisions for me."</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Moyin laughed bitterly, looking at the man beside him. </span><i><span>He seems so…foreign now; what happened to the man I'd grew up with?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"I see, your Highness. If you no longer have need for my advice, is it safe to assume that you have already abandoned my service and will no longer have a place for me by your side?"</span></p>
 <p><i><span>I have known you since fourteen, and made it my personal dream to help you ascend the throne. From the days of being your study assistant, to recent years when I'm the Grand Tutor, my every move have been for your greater good. Why does this have to happen, now that we're so close to success?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>"No need for such cold words, Grand Tutor. We have always been on the same side." The Heir was caugh off guard by his words, but that quickly changed into annoyance. "It is getting late and you should take care of your health, Grand Tutor. I shall get someone to send you home."</span></p>
 <p><span>"No need for that." Jiang Moyin stood up. "I can take care of myself."</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Perhaps, time and power can indeed change a person.</span></i></p>
