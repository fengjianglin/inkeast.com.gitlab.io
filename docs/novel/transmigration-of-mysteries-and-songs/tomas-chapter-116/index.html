 <p>Chapter 116 Cascades: Identity</p>
 <p>"Rui Bo, where is Father?" Qi Jianqiu woke up early in the morning.</p>
 <p>"Master is having a meeting with an important guest in the study; you can head over later on, young miss."</p>
 <p>"Alright, I understand. Thank you Rui Bo."</p>
 <p>"I shall take my leave, young miss.”</p>
 <p>"A meeting in the study right now?" Qi Jianqiu mumbled as she slowly walked towards the study. "Wasn't he supposed to head to the Shanyin Province for the investigation? Why is he still here when Chamberlain Feng had already set off?" She heard the voice of the Minister as soon as she approached the study and couldn't help but eavesdrop.</p>
 <p>"A brilliant plan to have Chamberlain Feng head down to Shanyin Province to begin the investigation on the Governor while you stay in Chang'an, Minister. Everyone knows that the Governor alone is not capable of embezzling so much money from the province's treasury; if you stay in the capital, you'll be able to root out any collaborators he'd had. I'm sure that's what his Majesty was thinking when he agreed to your request of having the Chamberlain join you in the investigation."</p>
 <p>"Of course his Majesty had that in mind, but I'm staying in Chang'an for now for another matter as well: the investigation of the Villa of Mount Baicha." The Minister replied. "Although his Majesty had seemingly agreed with the deduction and proposal of the 8th Prince, he is already viewing the Villa as a potential threat to his throne - one to be extricated. As his subject, it is my duty to lay his worries to rest."</p>
 <p>"You do indeed know his Majesty's intentions very well, Minister." The official sounded genuinely impressed. "I'm sure you already have clues, then."</p>
 <p>The conversation continued, but Qi Jianqiu paid no more attention.</p>
 <p>"Father is investigating the Villa of Mount Baicha as well! And from the looks of it, he intends to bring the Villa down instead of making them work for the Emperor!" <em>Argh…all this talk of the Villa makes me think of that fella Gan Qingjia…how can that playboy be so successful? </em></p>
 <p>"Argh….why do I have to know about his identity?" Qi Jianqiu pulled her hair in frustration as she wandered aimlessly into the antechamber.</p>
 <p>An attendant approached her. "Young miss, Master Xue has invited you to Manchun Tang, for a celebration of Master Gan."</p>
 <p>"Master Gan? Gan Qingjia? What does he have that is ever worthy of celebration?" <em>Argh! Why is he appearing everywhere? </em></p>
 <p>"Master Gan has been appointed as a manager of the Trade Bureau by his Majesty; Master Xue is hosting a feast in celebration of that." The attendant&nbsp; answered her questions to the best of his abilities.</p>
 <p>"A manager of the Trade Bureau? That's a Rank 5 official!" Qi Jianqiu was perplexed. "Why did he suddenly decide to become an official? Wait a second, why did the Emperor even give him a position in court?"</p>
 <p>"I don't know about that, young miss." The attendant shook his head.</p>
 <p>"Never mind about that. I guess I'll check it out then; no need to follow me out today." Qi Jianqiu rubbed her temples and headed out of the household.</p>
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
 <p>Gan Qingjia and Xue Yiqi were already seated in the dining room when QI Jianqiu arrived at Manchun Tang, each sipping on a goblet of wine. Seeing her enter the room, Gan Qingjia swirled the wine in his goblet, gesturing towards Qi Jianqiu.</p>
 <p>"Thought you'd be bringing some of your delicacies over for us; guess I shouldn't have had my hopes up huh?"</p>
 <p>Xue Yiqi smiled at her. "I was afraid you wouldn't come."</p>
 <p>"Why not? There's free food and wine." Qi Jianqiu sat down without even looking at Gan Qingjia, speaking only to Xue Yiqi. "Where is Situ and Jiang Moyin? Aren't the four of you sworn brothers?"</p>
 <p>Xue Yiqi explained. "Elder Brother Situ is really busy these few days, and Second Brother is resting at home from his ill health."</p>
 <p>"So the two of you just have too much time on your hands then?" Qi Jianqiu was ruthless.</p>
 <p>Xue Yiqi smiled awkwardly.</p>
 <p>Qi Jianqiu added. "Of course, that makes the three of us, or I wouldn't be here."</p>
 <p>The air froze in awkwardness; Gan Qingjia drank alone in silence. Xue Yiqi forced a laughter and tried to lighten the atmosphere. "Let's all have a drink together in honour of Third Brother's appointment!"</p>
 <p>Qi Jianqiu did not want to drink the wine handed to her, but her eyes caught the look on Gan Qingjia's face and she forced herself to take the goblet into her hands in a toast to Gan Qingjia.</p>
 <p>"I wish you a smooth sailing journey ahead of you in court." Qi Jianqiu downed the goblet of wine in a gulp.</p>
 <p>Gan Qingjia looked hard at her for a second before downing his own goblet in a gulp. Xue Yiqi could feel the palpable tension in the air, but was a little perplexed. <em>Shouldn't things be good between the two of them, since they both know that the proposal that day was just a plan for the moment? </em></p>
 <p>A knock sounded on the door of the dining room.</p>
 <p>"Master Xue, the Chief summons you right now. He says it is something important."</p>
 <p>Xue Yiqi jumped to his feet and went to the door, conversing with the messenger in hushed tones. He poked his head back through the door.</p>
 <p>"Third Brother, Jianqiu, I'm really sorry about this but I have to head back first."</p>
 <p>"Go ahead. Work is more important." Qi Jianqiu continued to stuff her mouth full of food, waving Xue Yiqi out of the room. Gan Qingjia nodded in agreement, and Xue Yiqi quickly disappeared from the room. Now, there was only Gan Qingjia and Qi Jianqiu left in the room, one engrossed in the food on the table while the other devoted to the wine.</p>
 <p>It was a while before Qi Jianqiu spoke up. "I never knew that you had intentions to be in court. Why do I feel as if this is goal you've been working towards, even though it looks like the result of your father's request to the Emperor?"</p>
 <p>"It is whatever you believe it is." Gan Qingjia chuckled, pouring a fresh goblet of wine and sliding it across the table towards QI Jianqiu.</p>
 <p>Her eyes widened, and the words left her mouth before she could stop them. "Are you really the Head of the Villa of Mount Baicha?"</p>
 <p>"I knew it was you outside the courtyard that day." Gan Qingjia answered without hesitation.</p>
 <p>"How is this possible!" It was almost impossible for Qi Jianqiu to believe the truth. <em>Who is his true self? Is he a playboy, a talented gentleman, or the mysterious Head of the Villa? </em></p>
 <p>"I'll take it as you haven't said anything to the Minister of the Right, then. Thanks for being so trustworthy." Gan Qingjia laughed.</p>
 <p>"Hmph!" Qi Jianqiu turned away from him. "I wouldn't tell Father anything that I wasn't sure about."</p>
 <p>"Will you still tell him, now that you know the truth?" Gan Qingjia was suddenly serious.</p>
 <p>Qi Jianqiu froze, her hand in mid-air.</p>
 <p>"Yes? Or No?" Gan Qingjia did not let the matter slide.</p>
 <p>Qi Jianqiu came to her senses and glared at him, taking a sip of her wine. Gan Qingjia burst out in laughter, the grin on his face lighting up the entire room. He was always handsome, and his laughter turned his charming eyes into crescent moons, giving him an added air of naivety. QI Jianqiu watched his transformation fixedly, before she was woken by the mocking light in his eyes.</p>
 <p>"You'd better come clean about your identity to the Emperor soon enough; Father has many capable men in his command and will definitely uncover the truth soon enough. He has always been fiercely loyal to the Emperor and will never hide anything from him."</p>
 <p>Gan Qingjia smiled in a funny way. "Do you really think that the Minister is that loyal to the Emperor?"</p>
 <p>"Hey! What are you trying to hint!" Qi Jianqiu was upset. "Father has always maintained a neutral position in court, only pledging his allegiance to the Emperor. Everybody knows about this."</p>
 <p>Gan Qingjia poured himself another goblet of wine. "I guess you don't know about it then. You were really young back then, and a girl as well. It's only natural that you know nothing about it."</p>
 <p>"Don't you dare bring anything about me being a girl into this thing." Qi Jianqiu's eyes almost burst into flames.</p>
 <p>Gan Qingjia smiled a little and told her the truth. "Seven years ago, the First Prince had formed the strongest alliance in court. The Minister of the Right was a firm supporter of the First Prince, and many officials in court knew about it. It's been many years and the Emperor has lowered his guard against the Minister. Now that Concubine Yao is a favourite of the Emperor, barely any of the officials dare speak of it again."</p>
 <p>Naturally, Qi Jianqiu did not know anything about it. "That was in the past; now, Father is loyal only to the Emperor."</p>
 <p>"Perhaps." Gan Qingjia answered half-heartedly.</p>
 <p>Qi Jianqiu went silent for a while. Even a girl like her could feel the stirring undercurrent in the political matters of the court. "What about you? Who do you support?" The words came out of her mouth before she could stop herself.</p>
 <p>"Who do you think I should support?" Gan Qingjia's serious demeanour was gone in an instant, replaced by the usual flirtatious smile.</p>
 <p>"Hmph! Can't you be serious for a while longer?" Qi Jianqiu sighed inwardly. <em>A mystery has solved itself, but another has showed itself. </em></p>
 <p>Finally, the two of them stood up to leave the restaurant.</p>
 <p>"Let's go; I'll have to report for work after I send you home." Gan Qingjia led the way, Qi Jianqiu following closely behind him The two ambled along the streets, attracting the attention of many passer-bys. The handsome man in the front had a charismatic smile on his face, while the beauty behind him looked deeply engaged in her thoughts. The old gossips of the couple that had sparked after the Chrysanthemum Appraisal gathering months before slowly gathered traction again.</p>
 <p>Gan Qingjia quickly noticed the looks and whisperings of the crowd around them, but Qi Jianqiu was as oblivious as ever. Finally, he could not take it anymore. Grabbing Qi Jianqiu by her hand, Gan Qingjia dashed out of the surrounding crowd, accompanied by cheers from the bystanders.</p>
 <p>When they finally stopped in a small alley, Gan Qingjia was greeted by the confused eyes of Qi Jianqiu. "What's happening? This isn't the way back home."</p>
 <p>Gan Qingjia was speechless. <em>This girl is so…</em> He looked at the confused look on Qi Jianqiu's face and slowly felt himself sinking into her beauty. He quickly shook it off.</p>
 <p>"Let's get going."</p>
 <p>The two kept small talk going all the way back to the Qi household, where Gan Qingjia suddenly stopped in his tracks. Before she could stop, Qi Jianqiu walked right into him.</p>
 <p>"Why did you stop!" Qi Jianqiu rubbed her forehead and looked up to see many boxes and containers outside the gate of the Qi household, accompanied by a caravan. A few attendants were talking to Rui Bo by the gates of the residence.</p>
 <p>"Argh…here we go again." Qi Jianqiu looked on helplessly. "Is the Eighth Prince trying to fight with the Heir? How many times has he sent such wedding gifts already?" <em>Speaking of which, this guy beside me has sent such wedding gifts before as well…even if it was just a joke. But…why do I feel a little happy whenever I think about it? </em></p>
 <p>Gan Qingjia looked expressionlessly at the caravan parked in the front of the Qi household, a cold light gleaming in his eyes.</p>
