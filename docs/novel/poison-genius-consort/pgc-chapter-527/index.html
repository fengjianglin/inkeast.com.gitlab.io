 <p>Chapter 527: Teaching with words and personal examples<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once she could finally breathe again, Han Yunxi felt much more comfortable. She quickly straightened up to be able to suck in deep lungfuls of air. Long Feiye’s hand was left touching nothing, causing him to regain his awareness. He ignored the reactions in his lower body to ask with concern, “Did you manage to cough it all out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi nodded as she adjusted her breathing, never realizing once how the man had just eaten his fill of her tofu. For her, emergency rescue situations were all too common, much less one involving herself. Under those kind of circumstances, who would worry about so many details? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Long Feiye was certain that she was alright, he silently exhaled. His gaze couldn’t help but wander to scan Han Yunxi’s body. The memory of her unclothed form in the hot springs at Jiangnan’s Plum Blossom Sea rose unbidden to his mind, turning his breath heavy. He always knew that this woman had an exquisite, delicately wrought form with all the right bumps and curves despite her petite frame. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was oblivious to his thoughts as she drank some water to clear her throat. Then she spoke seriously, “Long Feiye, here, let me teach you an emergency rescue technique.” She stood behind him in order to demonstrate, only to find that he was too tall for her to reach the spot. Without no other choice, she changed her methods. After hugging Long Feiye’s abdomen from the back, she had him bend forward. One of her hands curled into a fist against his stomach, above the belly button but below his sternum. The other wrapped around the fist and made quick pushing motions in and up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is an emergency method for treating choking victims. Just then I taught you a different one, let me demonstrate this next one.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This could be called teaching with words and personal examples.</span></i><span style> Han Yunxi’s expression was extremely focused as she took Long Feiye’s hand and rested it against her chest before leaning forward. “Form your other hand into a fist and place it between my shoulder blades.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye did as he was told, making Han Yunxi feel very satisfied. “Right, just like that. Now use force to beat my back! If that still doesn’t solve the problem after five to six hits, switch to the previous method.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was about to straighten up when Long Feiye muttered, “So the method Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>taught your lordship in the past was incorrect?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi finally recalled that memory from their past. When she choked on lotus seed soup, Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>had taught Long Feiye how to straighten her out. She’d been taken advantage of, but hadn’t dared to speak out about it. Suddenly, Han Yunxi seemed to recall something else as her head looked down, but it was already too late. Long Feiye’s other hand wrapped around her from behind and lightly rested over her chest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Last time with the soup, he had understood Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was trying to help him even amidst his panic. He had never expected that </span><i><span style>this woman</span></i><span style> could teach him rescue methods as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, have you taught these methods to anyone else before?” He lowered his head, his breaths hot and heavy as they brushed past her ear. Han Yunxi’s entire body grew stiff as she realized she had woken a wolf. But she couldn’t disentangle herself from his restless hands as her body began to tremble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you?” Long Feiye was quite serious. He could be extremely petty when it came to </span><i><span style>certain </span></i><span style>subjects!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“N...no one,” Han Yunxi replied truthfully. Long Feiye didn’t ask any more, but gently stroked her ear, his restless hands doting, teasing, and punishing her all at the same time. Gradually, Han Yunxi turned numb as she lost sense of herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yunxi…” he murmured softly as he held her tightly, pulling her even closer than before. The sound hypnotized her as she realized this was the </span><i><span style>first </span></i><span style>time he’d drawn so close. His hazy voice stimulated all of her senses as the last of her reason shattered. She allowed him to play with her ear as he wished. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Long Feiye, have we finished our journey of 100 steps?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye didn’t know anything about those steps. Right now, both his heart and mind were flustered, his powerful self-control having practically evaporated into the air. All doubts in his mind were thrown out the window as he picked up Han Yunxi and strode towards the bed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Someone knocked on the room’s door at that very moment, a forceful series of sounds that was obviously a secret signal. Neither Long Feiye nor Han Yunxi noticed, being far too preoccupied with each other, but the person outside the door was knocking with all his strength as if in a panic. Finally, the sound dragged Long Feiye’s reason back from the depths of his consciousness. He abruptly released Han Yunxi with a suddenness that jolted her back to her senses as well.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bangbangbang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The knocking didn’t stop as the two figures exchanged glances of surprise. He was surprised because he never expected to utterly lose all reason. He’d narrowly avoided ruining everything. She was so surprised because she never expected his reaction, which in turn gave her quite a fright. She wrapped the covers around herself and looked at him with furrowed brows, blushing even as she fumed and felt annoyed. A part of her was blaming him for everything as well, but in any case, her tiny face was dusted with pink. Such a complicated expression immediately made Long Feiye relax in spite of his tension. He felt a rising urge to laugh in the face of his helplessness. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Drawing close to her, he whispered wickedly by her ear, “You don’t want to stop?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was so embarrassed that she punched him on his shoulder and pushed him away. Her grumpy voice took on a coquettish tone as she shot back, “Naughty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye loved her vexed and embarrassed self, but in the end he still drew back to answer the door before it was pounded clear open. Seeing his form vanish behind the folding screen made Han Yunxi feel a little empty inside, but her thoughts quickly led her to giggle in secret.</span><i><span style> Whoever was knocking now had to be from the Wang Clan, or Gu Qi Sha himself, probably with business related to tomorrow’s Grand Medicine Testing Convention.</span></i><span style> The long-buried ploys they’d set in place would reach its climax tomorrow, but they were actually getting it on in Medicine City’s inn…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who's the more wicked one here, Long Feiye or me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t know who had come, but Long Feiye stood at the doorway for a long time. As Han Yunxi waited, her fingers brushed against the cinnabar gecko mark on her arm. She was nervous at the sight, guessing that it’d disappear soon enough. Its appearance had shocked quite a few people on Fishery Island. She was afraid of being laughed at when she was very clear on the nature of the relationship between her and Long Feiye. She liked their relationship now well enough. She didn’t have to be timid or careful in front of that man, but could do and act as she liked. Some things could only come along by mutual consent, so she would neither pursue nor reject them. If he wanted to be bad...</span><i><span style>then he could be as bad as he liked!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Long Feiye, it’s my pride and joy for me to like you. I won’t hide or suppress my feelings, because I don’t want to miss a thing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye took so long to talk to the person at the door that Han Yunxi had already straightened out her clothes by the time he came back. She had only caught snippets of his conversation, which had seemed to involve Ouyang Ningnuo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Was it someone from the Wang Clan?” Han Yunxi asked, her curiosity piqued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm. Ouyang Ningnuo went to stay with the Council of Elders yesterday and ended up talking all night with Head Elder Xie,” Long Feiye replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi gave a cold snort that was full of disdain. “That guy’s much harder to deal with than Jun Yixie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye’s laughter was even chillier than her disdainful snort. “No matter how hard to deal with he is, debts will be cleared all the same!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye hadn’t cost Ouyang Ningnuo the Sky Domain Black Market without a reason last time around. The man was clearly the other owner of the place, but he had refused to tell them outright just so he could use Long Feiye to deal with Zhangsun Zelin while devouring the entire black market in one gulp. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could Long Feiye be so easily used?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Ouyang Ningnuo had looked like he wanted to cooperate with Pill Fiend Pharmacy, but instead he was actually delivering his message so he could use them against the Mu and Xie Clans. After everything was over this time, he would reap all the benefits for himself. Because of all that, Long Feiye was going to thoroughly counterattack. Let’s see</span><i><span style> if he dares to try this again next time!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Rest early. I have to take a trip over to the Wang Clan and I won’t be back till late,” Long Feiye told her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi nodded obediently, her cheeks still flushed. She steadily pretended that their lapse of reason hadn’t happened at all.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is she really going to pretend that nothing happened earlier? </span></i><span style>&nbsp;Long Feiye was a little surprised by it, yet he decided to keep quiet and leave. Just as he turned to walk out, Han Yunxi suddenly grabbed ahold of him by his robes. “Long Feiye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye’s lips drew up into a warm smile. He seemed very happy that she was trying to keep him back. But Han Yunxi only said, “You haven’t eaten dinner yet. You can leave after you eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye gave a slight start before he gave into a chuckle. “Alright, I’ll eat with you before I leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are </span><i><span style>you</span></i><span style> laughing about?” Han Yunxi asked mock indignantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing much, let’s eat,” Long Feiye replied lightly. Their conversation became more normal as both of them seemed to have come to a tacit understanding on to not bring up what had just happened. Since all the dishes had cooled down, Long Feiye had the waiter replace them with fresh, hot ones and poured Han Yunxi yet </span><i><span style>another</span></i><span style> bowl of soup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Make sure to drink it slowly…” Long Feiye trailed off, before adding, “Don’t choke again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thankfully, Han Yunxi hadn’t started drinking her soup yet, or else she might have really choked one more time thanks to his words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” she replied, before silently eating her meal. Long Feiye preferred to eat his meals quickly without speaking, so the two of them shared a quiet meal together. However, both of them chose to take their time, neither wanting to be the first to finish. In the end, they had completely polished off all the dishes on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be good and wait here for me. Chu Xifeng and Tang Li are nearby, so you do not need to worry,” Long Feiye murmured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Han Yunxi was very cooperative. She had long guessed that there were plenty of people watching her because Long Feiye had left to visit the Wang Clan in secret after reaching Medicine City. Now her thoughts were confirmed. In the end, it was the usually quick and decisive Long Feiye who paused to look back at the inn after walking out through its doors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi,” he muttered to himself, “After I seize Medicine City, I’ll bring you to visit Celestial Mountain.” He hadn’t originally planned to visit his sect so soon, yet now he wished he could get there faster so he could settle all his old scores. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Li and Chu Xifeng only emerged from their hiding places once they were certain that Long Feiye had finally left. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your master’s dawdling more and more readily these days,” Tang Li observed candidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He would never drag his feet like this if esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>was not around,” Chu Xifeng observed in turn. The two of them simultaneously glanced towards the inn before Chu Xifeng laughed. “Young Sect Master Tang, you were right to escape from your wedding. One can’t afford to provoke women.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Li chuckled. “That’s only if the woman in question is that female master of yours. The rest are all fine.” </span><i><span style>Supposedly</span></i><span style>, his bride’s family had sent forces searching for him all over the world, but they’d yet to find him. That had proved that their powers were only average, at best. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Han Yunxi was sitting and staring at the messy covers of the bed with a silly grin on her face. Her thoughts were unreadable, but her smile was equal parts sweet and foolish. It didn’t fit her usual self at all! After washing herself up, she lost herself on another spiritual tour of her detox system. The nights in Medicine City were very cold with the beginning of winter approaching. She made sure to lie on the very inside of the bed, leaving a space for Long Feiye. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she was about to fall asleep, her eyes flew open as she remembered yet another problem. “Where’s that guy, Gu Qishao?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few days ago, she had received news from him that he had already used the roundworm poison and reached Mu Linger’s side. He would meet up with their side once they arrived at the city. It was now the middle of the night, but he still hadn’t shown up. </span><i><span style>What was going on?</span></i></p>
