 <p>Chapter 46: Your lordship forbids you from being scared&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Long Feiye didn’t realize that his eyes were looking on in admiration as he took out a money pouch and threw it at Han Yunxi. Despite this, Han Yunxi tossed it back and said, “It’s not too late if I take it after I see and treat the poison.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was an avaricious woman, but not covetous. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye said nothing as he turned and left, with Han Yunxi following afterwards. </span><i><span style>Gah! </span></i><span style>The wind was fierce outside. Long Feiye walked very fast, forcing her to run in order to keep up. She couldn’t help but think that they’d get a carriage when they left the gates. And yet they’d only reached the doors of the Hibiscus Courtyard before Long Feiye stilled his steps. Han Yunxi ducked behind him to avoid the wind as she trembled. “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye turned around and opened an arm to lift up his spacious cloak. His voice was as cold as frost. “Come in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gale made his cloak shudder and dance in the wind. His features looked firm and staunch in the darkness, those eyebrows resting as knives across his brow. He was like some god of the shadows, looking down at her with in seeming disdain. Han Yunxi was dumbfounded. For a moment, she couldn’t figure out what he meant. Long Feiye was impatient and used a hand to pull her into his embrace. His arms enveloped her until she was wrapped tightly in his cloak against the winter chill. In that moment, Han Yunxi’s heart started thumping wildly as she was left in a fluster…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heavens! </span></i><span style>His body was so warm and exuded a sort of sleepy fragrance. Was this the so-called warmth of an angel’s wings? It was so cozy! Before Han Yunxi could recover her senses, Long Feiye held her close and took a few light steps before soaring into the northwestern skies…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was covered by the cloak as she nestled snugly in Long Feiye’s embrace, flying through the air with him faster than any horse! She couldn’t see anything clearly in the dark beyond the occasional lantern and had no idea where he was taking her. Still, she felt at ease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though her body was warm, the wind was still fierce and cold like knives cutting against her skin. Very soon, Han Yunxi found herself unable to stand it. She tried to turn her face to the side, then lower her head, but couldn’t find any way to hide. In the end, she had no choice but to try and carefully shift her body. When she saw that Long Feiye had no reaction, she boldly wrapped her arms around him and completely shifted sideways, burying her head against him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, she was completely warm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be a lie to say that she wasn’t nervous. She kept stiff for a long time before seeing that Long Feiye didn’t seem to mind her being this close. Only then did she relax and enjoy the body heat. He kept his eyes forward as he sped along, although a slight curve crept onto his lip unawares. He might have disdained her cowardice, but he also puzzled over her courage. Still, those dark and depthless eyes remained elusive and enigmatic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He held on to her as they leapt over walls and across rooftops into the wilds beyond. She only felt the wind whistling past her as she remained ignorant to it all, slowly growing sleepy in his arms. It was only after Long Feiye descended to the ground and stood her upright that she recovered her senses. Once she drew out her head, she realized that it was early morning and they were on a tall cliff. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye looked down. “You can let go now.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ehh…? </span></i><span style>She gave a start before realized he’d already released her, but she was still hugging his waist! Her face red, Han Yunxi let go as if she’d been electrocuted and struggled free of his cape. As soon as she left the shield of his cloak, the winter wind assailed her from four directions. Still, Han Yunxi felt that her face was very hot. She did her best to ignore the awkwardness and asked without looking his way, “What are we doing here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye glanced at the colors of the sky. “Waiting a quarter of an hour.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strange, why did this guy bring her here? Wasn’t it to treat poison? </span><i><span style>Is someone coming in a quarter of an hour?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi didn’t ask anything more, but sized up her surroundings. She realized that they were surrounded by lofty ridges and towering mountains, making it impossible to tell where they were. Beneath the cliff’s edge in front of them was a mist-covered abyss that made it impossible to see the bottom. The sun had already risen, illuminating the gray dawn with glittering gold in a magnificent sight. It had been a long time since she’d seen the sunrise. Just when she was spellbound by the sight, a sudden </span><i><span style>dootdootdoot, dootdootdoot </span></i><span style>appeared in her consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There’s poison?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Judging from the rhythm and volume of the warning, this was an extremely potent type! Han Yunxi grew vigilant as she turned towards Long Feiye, who was also enjoying the sunrise. “There’s poison around here, what’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye was astonished. “How did you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This poison is very strange. Quickly tell me, what’s going on?” Han Yunxi turned serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only now did Long Feiye look towards the abyss. “A poison fog fills the air down there throughout the year. At night, it sinks to the valley floor, but at sunrise, it rises up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi didn’t expect that the poison wouldn’t come from human or animal sources, but the air itself. “You want to go down?” she asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s a Northern Li Country agent hiding down there skilled in the use of poisons,” Long Feiye explained lightly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>So that was it. He came to capture someone but couldn’t descend because of the poison fog. Han Yunxi studied the wisps of fog that floated up, eyebrows knitting minutely. </span><i><span style>The situation isn’t anything like Long Feiye thinks at all!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you deal with it?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, the quarter of an hour had finished. A faint cloud of black appeared within the fog, setting off the sensor in Han Yunxi’s head to max alert. Yet just as quickly, the black mass floated towards the mountain valley and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See that? The black fog is the most poisonous bit,” Long Feiye murmured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet Han Yunxi replied, “This isn’t poison fog.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye’s so-called poison fog was another word for miasma, filthy air from the depths of the mountain forest. It showed up from the end of spring until the end of autumn, when temperatures turned too cold to create it. Right now it was winter, so the sun-kissed mountaintops were freezing, but what about the darkness of the mountain valley?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what is it?” Long Feiye asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d once sent a team of troops into the valley. Half of them were injured or dead before ever finding the target. Those who escaped said there was some sort of miasma before poison overtook their lives. The agent hiding in the valley had in possession important military secrets from Tianning Country. An escape would have unimaginable consequences. He’d chased this agent for over a month now and gotten poisoned by the same person the last time he tried to search. This agent was extremely crafty and only released poison at the last second. Before that, he didn’t expect him to use poisons. Long Feiye cornered him here, where the agent hid himself and refused to come out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It might be a poisonous mosquito swarm.” Han Yunxi was doubtful as well, never expecting to meet such things. But many ancient texts had records of foul fogs that floated past and left poisoned people in its wake. Thus, they were branded as miasma. The truth of the matter was, these clouds of black</span> <span style>hide something very common: mosquitoes flying in large swarms that made them seem like sentient gas. These mosquitoes carried vicious strains of malaria that infected humans and livestock, killing them quickly without treatment in a similar way to poison. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The current climate was incapable of creating poisonous miasmas, but the fog in the valley could very possibly harbor poisonous bugs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Poisonous mosquito swarm?” It was the first time Long Feiye had heard of such a thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The white fog isn’t poison. That black mass is actually a mosquito swarm, but looks like fog in bad lighting and tricked you all,” Han Yunxi explained, before adding, “Take me down there, I need to get closer to that black mass to see what type of mosquito it is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The modern era alone had countless strains of mosquitoes, much less ancient history. Many of them had become extinct, so even more varieties might have existed in the past. Han Yunxi had to verify whether she could identify the species before creating an effective mosquito repellant. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they’d confirmed that the white fog was harmless, things were simple for Long Feiye. He said nothing more and pulled Han Yunxi in by a hand on her waist before leaping into the abyss. As soon as they entered the mountain valley, her poison sensors started setting off alarms again. Very quickly, she determined it location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“On the right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye held her tight as they approached the poison, before her sensors alerted her to more toxins on the left.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It couldn’t be...that there was more than one swarm?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was surprised. Who knew that right at this moment, another alarm went off to tell her of poisons in front and behind them. </span><i><span style>Heavens, </span></i><span style>with poisons approaching them from four ends, weren’t they being encircled?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve been surrounded,” she said in a low voice. Her words had hardly finished when Long Feiye saw a miasma-like mass of black flying towards them from four sides. He didn’t expect there to be four swarms either, but remained calm. “How close do you need to be to guess the poison?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry and go, it’s too dangerous! They’re extremely fast,” Han Yunxi said, deciding on escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Long Feiye’s voice remained cold. “Answer your lordship’s question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ten steps, at least ten steps and I’ll be able to identify the poison!” Han Yunxi said truthfully.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ten steps. </span></i><span style>Judging by the speed of the poison swarms, it’d take them a second to reach them from ten steps away. In addition, they were surrounded on all sides. Han Yunx didn’t dare think about it. She didn’t even know what kinds of poisons the swarms were carrying or whether it could be analyzed and resisted. If she was poisoned, what then? In the midst of her panic, Long Feiye only replied with two words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can’t!” Han Yunxi shouted, staring as the swarms drew closer and closer. She could almost hear their annoying, terrifying buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Prepare to examine them,” Long Feiye commanded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn’t an ordinary poison, but a poison swarm. Four of them on all sides closing in was much more horrifying than a single swarm. They’d be swallowed up and torn to pieces. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi admitted that she was a coward. “We can’t, I’m scared!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Long Feiye suddenly drew her into his embrace with a cold tone. “Your lordship is here and forbids you from being scared!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So strong and forceful!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi hated arrogant and conceited men who swaggered around without reason, but she didn’t feel that way this time. Her heart thumped in her chest as she suddenly calmed down. The power of this man made her feel safe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the four swarms drew even nearer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you ready?” Long Feiye asked in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Calmer now, Han Yunxi adopted a professional air and activated her scanner to continuously sweep the surrounding areas, before lowering her voice in turn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ready.”</span></p>
