 <p>Chapter 302: Overthinking things?&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye’s behavior in the imperial prisons and then his actions at Medical City, were basically one big joke to fool Emperor Tianhui. Now that his scheme with Long Tianmo had failed, how could Emperor Tianhui simply sit still? As soon as he got wind of Long Feiye and Han Yunxi’s return, he summoned them to the palace. See here, Eunuch Xue had even come to their gates with a carriage in tow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue’s question reminded Han Yunxi that Long Feiye wasn’t here. It wouldn’t be any good if she went to the palace by herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>go and ask when His Highness is planning to return,” Han Yunxi ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>only shook her head helplessly. “Chu Xifeng’s not here, either. Most likely, no one else at the estate knows either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then send someone to search the Solitary Enclosure and Hidden Pavilion.” These were Long Feiye’s two secret residences located within Tianning’s capital city. Most of his time in the capital was spent in these two locations. Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was originally a servant of the palace, so she naturally knew the severity of the current situation. She quickly sent people off to look, but they soon returned to say that His Highness wasn’t present at either locations. He’d left the city after lunch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The time it took to brew a cup of tea passed before Eunuch Xue grew impatient. He couldn’t help but urge, “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>just waiting around isn’t a solution! If His Highness isn’t here, you can go to the palace first. The emperor is waiting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi personally delivered a cup of good tea along with a secret purse filled with silver to Eunuch Xue. “Eunuch Xue, His Highness will be here shortly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eunuch Xue glanced at the purse before revealing an expression of disdain. </span><i><span style>It wasn’t enough for him! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi doubled the amount and said, “Eunuch Xue, you’ve worked hard. Drink some tea and rest for awhile.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Eunuch Xue relent. Ignoring the presence of Gu Beiyue and Mu Qingwu, he accepted the silver right then and there. Han Yunxi thought that was it, but Eunuch Xue stood up as soon as he put away his silver, calm and composed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>still won’t go to the palace, this old servant will return by myself. When the emperor decides on a punishment, heheh… The crime for defying an imperial decree isn’t slight!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tsk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi sucked in a cold breath. This old eunuch could’ve simply refused the silver, but he still said such things even after accepting the bribe? Was he trying to make fun of her? She narrowed her eyes and stared coldly at Eunuch Xue, who had obviously come prepared since he met her gaze squarely. Gu Beiyue and Mu Qingwu could both sense that Eunuch Xue had purposely picked a time when the Duke of Qin was away to make trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>please calm your anger.” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>could tell as well, but secretly tugged on Han Yunxi’s robes as she coaxed, “Before you beat a dog, you have to be aware of its owner. You must endure.” If esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>made a move, Heaven knew what kind of crime Eunuch Xue would pin on them. He was the representative of Emperor Tianhui and was here on an imperial summons. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“A dog would at least bark a few times after being fed silver!” Han Yunxi murmured. Of course she could tell that this was a trap, but she endured. “Eunuch Xue, let’s go then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>this one needs to meet His Majesty in the palace as well. Let’s go together,” Mu Qingwu hastily stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young General, it’s already getting late in the day. Without the emperor’s summons, you cannot enter the palace. This old servant asks that you refrain from stirring up muddy waters.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingwu was about to retort when Han Yunxi silenced him with a look. Now was the time when their foe saw the enemy in every bush and tree; getting mixed up in the conflict between Emperor Tianhui and His Highness Duke of Qin wasn’t easy for anyone. As things stood now, Emperor Tianhui was a tough foe to provoke, but His Highness Duke of Qin was also as stable as Mt. Tai. Most of the court officials, imperial clansmen, and old, established families had chosen to keep a moderate stance between the two. Mu Qingwu was in dire straits himself, so his willingness to stand out made him enough of a man already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, it really would be useless if he came along. The one waiting for them in the palace was none other than Tianning’s highest authority, its ruler. He would only worsen his plight if he went.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Imperial Physician Gu, Young General, I won’t be able to receive you today. Let’s continue this some other time,” Han Yunxi’s face was full of optimism, her bearing graceful and elegant. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingwu didn’t speak, but followed Han Yunxi and Eunuch Xue all the whole way to the carriage. Gu Beiyue had never expressed his opinions out loud, but he too, followed closely behind Han Yunxi. And yet, when they reached the gates, they saw Long Feiye standing by the carriage with his hands clasped behind his back. His posture was tall and straight, his appearance handsome. The imposing manner of his presence was simple and steady. In a flash, everyone froze in their tracks. Han Yunxi’s lips curved up into a grin because she knew she was safe for good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had no idea that people had been especially sent to guard her after that night with Aunt Ru. Even something as minor as the wind ruffling through the grass would be instantaneously reported to Long Feiye. Eunuch Xue was caught off guard and stood there, stunned. After all, the emperor had made inquiries before he came to verify that His Highness Duke of Qin had left the city. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the gazes of everyone present, Long Feiye reached out a hand towards Han Yunxi. “Still not coming over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemed to ask her this question often.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Han Yunxi, you’re still not coming over?’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Han Yunxi, you’re still not leaving?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although his tone was cold and impatient, Han Yunxi loved listening to that voice. She eagerly strode over with a happy heart. Of course, she didn’t forget to prick Eunuch Xue with a laxative as she passed by him. The eunuch stood with his head bowed, afraid to even make a fart. Leaving aside the fact that Emperor Tianhui had seized the chance when His Highness Duke of Qin was gone to order him to fetch Han Yunxi, there was the simple reality that he had no way of causing His Highness Duke of Qin any difficulties to begin with!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye held Han Yunxi by the hand and helped her onto the carriage. He was about to get on himself when he stopped and turned around. “Eunuch Xue, since when did imperial brother grant you the privilege of seeing your lordship without bowing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eunuch Xue had indeed forgotten. He quickly knelt on one knee. “This old servant greets Your Highness Duke of Qin. May Your Highness be blessed with 10,000 years of fortune!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye didn’t spare him a glance before climbing on the carriage and leaving. Mu Qingwu and Gu Beiyue both looked with rapt attention as the carriage left. They were a little unreconciled, but helpless at the same time. Still, their hearts were at ease since it was Long Feiye who had taken Han Yunxi away. Only when the carriage left their line of vision did they stop looking and exchanged glances. Both of them broke into small smiles of mutual sympathy. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Eunuch Xue… Long Feiye had never given him permission to rise. Heaven knew how long he’d be kneeling in front of the Duke of Qin’s estate?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>When hitting a dog, know who its owner is. </span></i><span style>Long Feiye not only avenged Han Yunxi, but beat Emperor Tianhui’s dog in front of everyone in the world. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Long Feiye and Han Yunxi arrived at the palace, they were told that Emperor Tianhui was entertaining the empress dowager with a banquet at her palace. By the time they reached her Peace and Wellness Palace, they discovered that crown prince Long Tianmo and </span><i><span style>Qinwang </span></i><span style>Rong were present as well. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What was the meaning of this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye’er, is your </span><i><span style>mufei </span></i><span style>doing well?” the empress dowager still treated Long Feiye quite politely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye nodded but didn’t speak. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that she often visits Murong Wanru at Marquis Pingbei’s estate?” the empress dowager asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not clear.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye could always leave the empress dowager in a awkward position with just a few words. Thus, she pulled Han Yunxi aside and lightly patted her hand. “Yunxi, you’ve saved the crown prince’s life again. Today it’s not just the emperor but myself as well who are planning to reward you!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was she really here to get a reward? </span></i><span style>Han Yunxi felt that she’d overthought things. She pasted on a smile and said, “</span><i><span style>Chenqie </span></i><span style>is already content with the fact that I’m not imprisoned in chains with a criminal name. I dare not accept any rewards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Long Feiye was sitting next to her, she didn’t spare anything with her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Emperor, just look. This girl is mad at you! You nearly framed an innocent person and ruined Tianmo’s life!” the empress dowager pretended to scold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine if </span><i><span style>chenqie </span></i><span style>was framed, but it’s the crown prince’s life that’s more important. As long as the crown prince is well, what does it matter if </span><i><span style>chenqie </span></i><span style>was wronged?” Han Yunxi was quite magnanimous with her words, but everyone present was intelligent enough to understand her meaning.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Emperor Tianhui had used the crown prince’s life as a counter to frame her! And now, she was sowing discord!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Emperor Tianhui’s eyes flashed with hatred. If he had any regrets in this life, it was being too softhearted. He’d readily trusted Long Feiye’s stance in the prisons and didn’t torture Han Yunxi to death. The crown prince was a pawn that he’d discarded easily, yet Han Yunxi not only saved this chess piece, but returned to sow discord between them. </span><i><span style>She was truly trying to instigate trouble!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Emperor Tianhui himself had underestimated the severity of the situation. It had long surpassed the state of a nuisance and had become a deep set loathing. Long Tianmo appeared calm on the surface, but his hands had long clenched into fists beneath the table. </span><i><span style>He thoroughly despised this father of his! </span></i><span style>If not for this time, he would have still tried his hardest to share his father’s burdens and be a fitting successor to the throne. But now he understood that the only way to protect his current position as crown prince was to ascend the throne early. Otherwise, he’d be sitting around waiting for his doom, while his father held him in the palm of his hand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The struggle for the throne wasn’t simply limited to brothers, but between fathers and sons as well!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Crown prince, what do you think?” Emperor Tianhui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Tianmo was quite intelligent. Instead of answering the question, he simply rose to his feet with a wine cup in hand. “</span><i><span style>Erchen </span></i><span style>has caused Imperial Father to worry over the past few years. </span><i><span style>Erchen </span></i><span style>will penalize myself with three cups of wine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Emperor Tianhui nod his head in satisfaction. “Sit down. You should be clear on why </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>has cultivated you all these years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, they had wanted to find trouble for Han Yunxi, but never expected that she'd instigate them instead. The last thing the empress dowager wanted was to see the emperor and crown prince at odds. The emperor was her son, while the crown prince was a grandson that affected the fate of her parental home. She dearly wished that he would inherit the throne smoothly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone come, bring over the item that I've prepared,” the empress dowager changed the topic just in time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A servant girl then brought over a deep green jade bracelet, its lovely emerald green luster marking it as a top-quality jade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This was left to me by the previous empress dowager. It's been with me for many years. Yunxi, today I'll give it to you.” So speaking, the empress dowager personally put it on Han Yunxi’s wrist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi subconsciously withdrew her hand, alarmed by the sudden favoritism. It couldn't be that she was really getting rewarded?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The empress dowager still managed to grab her hand. “Such a girl, are you looking down on this bracelet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, no. It's simply too precious, </span><i><span style>chenqie</span></i><span style> can’t…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The empress dowager refused to let Han Yunxi reject her and forcibly put the bracelet on her wrist. Han Yunxi cast Long Feiye a glance. When she saw that he had kept quiet, she silently accepted the jewelry as well. By now, Emperor Tianhui’s reward had arrived too, in the form of an imperial decree. At this, Han Yunxi glanced at Long Feiye again, only to see him crease his eyebrows. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Typically, it was impossible to defy an imperial decree without sufficient reasons. Back when Long Feiye refused the decree to marry Duanmu Yao, the consequences hadn't been slight. This imperial decree made Han Yunxi none other than the Right Courtyard Head of the Imperial Physician Courtyard while relegating its original head, Gu Beiyue, to take charge of the Left Courtyard. She was also bestowed a salary equivalent to that of a third-rank official.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was left stunned by the time the eunuch finished reading the decree. It was hard enough being a daughter-in-law of the imperial family, much less one of its officials! Emperor Tianhui’s move this time was extremely formidable!</span></p>
 <p><span style>And yet, the most formidable move had yet to come…</span></p>
