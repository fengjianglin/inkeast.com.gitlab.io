 <p><span style>Chapter 113: Fortune amidst misfortune</span>&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Will or won’t she confess?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing thing, Bilü’s heart gave a violent </span><i><span style>thump! </span></i><span style>She assumed that Guard Shangguan would say something or ask her questions so she’d know what was going on. But his first words were for her to confess!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was she supposed to confess to? </span></p>
 <p><span style>What did they know?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides stealing the canister of tea, what else did she had to admit to? Bilü hung her head, heart thumping in her chest. She was very, very nervous.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Should she admit it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t resist stealing a peek at the godlike man sitting up high. A single glance was enough to make her retract her gaze in terror. Her heart narrowly avoided leaping out of her chest. She didn’t know who this man was, but she was certain that he had a very honored position. That’s why even the young general treated him with utmost respect. Something major must have happened at the teashop, so it shouldn’t have anything to do with her stealing the tea leaves, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to confess or not?!” Guard Shangguan asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know...I don’t know anything!” Bilü burst out, her mouth moving quicker than her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t know? I think you’re just refusing to cry until you see the coffin[1]!” Guard Shangguan raged, before taking out a whip to hit the air. </span><i><span style>Shua! </span></i><span style>The crack of the whip was swift and fierce. Terrified, Bilü instinctively covered her ears and shrank to one side, trembling. Her mind had turned completely blank as she forgot about everything! No matter how intelligent she was, she was still an ordinary tea servant. This fright was enough to bring her to tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guard Shangguan, spare me! Spare me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bilü, you’re a smart girl. Confess and we’ll go easy on you, resist and we’ll be serious. You should understand this logic!” Guard Shangguan reminded her coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, Bilü capitulated as soon as he said those words. Shaking until her teeth started to chatter, she spoke, “I confess...I...I con, confess. I confess everything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this, Long Feiye’s eyes turned cold as he finally looked at the tea servant head-on. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak!” Even Guard Shangguan had turned nervous. He never thought that they’d get results from pressuring her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just...I...I…” Bilü’s lips shook, making it hard for her to speak. Mu Qingwu was burning with impatience. He took large strides over and grabbed Bilü by the collar, disregarding the fact that she was a female.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak!” he cried out angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...I stole...stole a guest’s tea leaves, I…” Bilü stammered, but Mu Qingwu and Guard Shangguan were already astonished before she could finish.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stole tea leaves?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>An amazed Mu Qingwu released Bilü, allowing her to breathe normally. She crawled to Guard Shangguan’s feet and hugged him tightly, pleading pathetically. “Guard Shangguan, please spare me! I’m begging you! I still have that tin of tea leaves hidden in my rooms, I haven’t even opened it yet. I’ll give it back to Second Young Miss Han, I’ll apologize to her, just spare me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps if Bilü had been calmer, she wouldn’t have confessed. But her guilty conscience couldn’t withstand the threat of Guard Shangguan’s whip, so how could she keep her cool? She had never experienced something so frightening before. It’d left all her thoughts in disorder and turned her mind completely blank. Her only recourse was to confess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guard Shangguan only felt that he had lost a lot of face. Instead of finding out details about the southern mountain ambush, the interrogation had revealed this disgraceful scandal instead! He shook his head, eyebrows tightly knitted as he started at Bilü, unsure of what to say. Had he been too busy this year and neglected disciplining these servants?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shameful!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Guard Shangguan, please spare me...spare me, I won’t dare do it again, I really won’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guard Shangguan...you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut your mouth!” Guard Shangguan roared. A terrified Bilü immediately fell silent. Guard Shangguan braced himself and nervously looked towards Long Feiye. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, Long Feiye seemed interested as he asked, “You hid Second Young Miss Han’s tea leaves?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bilü only thought that this cold voice, despite being low and deep, was pleasant to the ears. It was just like the low notes of a </span><i><span style>qin</span></i><span style>[2] playing against her heartstrings, whose sound mesmerized her until she forgot she was being questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you dawdling for, His Highness Duke of Qin is asking you a question!” Guard Shangguan rebuked. Abruptly, Bilü recovered her wits and gave Long Feiye a look of disbelief. </span><i><span style>His Highness Duke of Qin?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Heavens, he was the Duke of Qin!</span></p>
 <p><span style>No wonder, no </span><i><span style>wonder </span></i><span style>this man was as venerable as some Immortal of the night. His Highness Duke of Qin was already a godly man! Bilü felt herself seized with panic as she gaped at Long Feiye, too stunned to talk. Her expression reminded Long Feiye of Han Yunxi, except Han Yunxi’s eyes were much prettier!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt extremely fed up as he expression turned colder and colder. Mu Qingqwu knew his temper and hurried to speak up. “Were Second Young Miss Han’s tea leaves meant as a gift for Liuyue?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes...no…” Bilü said incoherently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Was it or not?!” Mu Qingwu demanded. He thought there was some logic in how His Highness Duke of Qin abhorred lovestruck women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your servant isn’t clear. Those tea leaves were brought over by Second Young Miss Han, who forgot to take them with her when she left. In the past, she’d always leave tea leaves in a certain place before giving them to Miss Mu. This time, she left without handing them over...and...and I don’t know if it was because she forgot to,” Bilü explained in a rush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afraid at Mu Qingwu wouldn’t believe her, she was quick to stress, “Your servant hasn’t touched the tea, it’s still in my rooms.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingwu was both surprised and thrilled; he hadn’t expected to wrangle something like this from an interrogation. He and esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>had just about given up on investigating tea leaves for poison when they found some at this criticial point! According to their conjectures, it was very possible for Second Young Miss Han’s tea leaves to contain poison. As long as they discovered poison within that tin, then all the doubts surrounding the Ten-Thousand Snake Poison would be dispelled. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This should be called fortune within misfortune!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingwu glanced towards Long Feiye, whose complexion looked much better than before. Guard Shangguan stood listening on one side, completely out of the loop. But he had the quick thinking to order his men to bring the tea over. As for the Bilü who’d been so scared that she’d confessed regarding the tea leaves, it was certain that she wasn’t a spy. Guard Shangguan didn’t dare to question Long Feiye directly, but shot a look at Mu Qingwu to ask what should be done with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lock her up for now to wait for further interrogation!” Mu Qingwu said seriously. When he said interrogation, it wasn’t for this kidnapping case, but the case of the Ten-Thousand Snake Poison. If the leaves really had poison, Bilü would be a key witness. Of course, Guard Shangguan couldn’t tell the meaning behind his words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon enough, Bilü’s stolen tin of tea leaves was found and delivered. It was in an oval porcelain container, about five </span><i><span style>cun</span></i><span style>[3]</span> <span style>tall. It had no labels and was sealed exceptionally well. Mu Qingwu was just about certain when he saw the tightly sealed opening. Many of the teas that Liuyue had given him were sealed in exactly the same way. Though he was eager to find a poisons expert to inspect the tea for toxins, he could only endure before His Highness Duke of Qin’s total silence. After all, finding Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>was more important! </span></p>
 <p><span style>He personally accepted the container, checked the seal, and made sure it was actually tea inside before handing it to His Highness Duke of Qin. Guard Shangguan was very curious and expected the Duke of Qin to say something, but he didn’t. He set the container of tea leaves aside, his slim and attractive fingers resting on its lid as he wore an indolent, mysterious gaze. Silence stretched on before Long Feiye looked towards Guard Shangguan. “Keep on interrogating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your highness, all of remaining prisoners are people in charge of the south mountain who were locked up together. All were present when esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>was attacked and kidnapped. There’s the servant who guided the way, two female tea servants, and 15 guards in charge of south mountain’s security,” Guard Shangguan reported truthfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye mused for a bit before handing the container of tea leaves in his hands to Chu Xifeng with an order. “Bring this back and have it carefully examined.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did he rise to his feet. “Since there’s so many of them, your lordship will go in person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taking a step back to analyze the situation, even if the assassins had the skills to silently make an ambush in the tea plantation, someone had to have tipped them off. Otherwise, how could they know Han Yunxi and Mu Qingwu would go to the south mountain? There had to be a spy within the ranks. He refused to believe that he couldn’t find them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Long Feiye began his personal interrogation, the men scattered in the barren hills, Celestial Fragrance Teashop, and the general’s estate were all on edge, using their time to conduct the search. Yet none of them could imagine that the assassin was hiding right in a cliffside cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi lay on the ground, face ashen and covered in sweat while she muttered to herself in a daze, as if having a nightmare. Suddenly, she gave a shrill cry and sat up, opening her eyes at the same time. In her dream, she’d kept falling and falling. Right before she was about to hit the ground, she’d been jolted awake, covered in cold sweat. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After recovering her senses, Han Yunxi finally realized that she was in a dim cave. Hadn’t she fallen off a cliff? She didn’t fall to her death? Why was she here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t remember how she lost consciousness, only the moment she’d sailed over the edge. Her professional habits had her inspecting herself for the medical pouch; fortunately, it was still there!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s awake!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a cold female voice spoke. Han Yunxi thought that it sounded familiar, but she didn’t think much of it. She quickly looked over and saw two woman standing behind her. One of them wore a black facemask and a bandage around her arm, the exact female who’d kidnapped her. The other masked woman was the one who spoke. Though Han Yunxi couldn’t see her features clearly, she could tell that this woman was much older than her young kidnapper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Putting herself on guard, she angrily asked, “Just who are you people? Why did you kidnap me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re quite arrogant! This grandaunt[4] hasn’t even settled my score with you yet!” the masked girl huffed, stalking over with long strides. If her master hadn’t left orders to spare Han Yunxi’s life, she’d killed her long ago. This slut was overconfident in her poisoning skills and tried to poison her, she must be sick of living!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you have any guts, take off that mask and let me see what you look like! Otherwise, this </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>can’t remember if I owe you anything!” Han Yunxi gave a cold snort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still talking back!” the girl strode over, ready to give her a resounding slap. But Han Yunxi blocked it with a poisoned needle hidden in her palm that pierced the girl’s palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!” the girl shrieked as she kicked with her foot. “You slut!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you’re sensible, you’ll let me go. Otherwise, I promise you’ll die from the poison within an hour!” Han Yunxi said coldly. Since she was in their hands now, she wouldn’t allow herself to be bullied!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl glanced at her palm in disbelief. “You’re still making a fool of yourself with these trifling poisons!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Han Yunxi only took more exception to it with a smile. “A trifling Poison Human like you has nothing to be haughty over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At these words, both the masked girl and masked woman grew alarmed. Han Yunxi knew about the existence of </span><i><span style>“Poison Humans?”</span></i></p>
