 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s an accountant to take care of the accounts,” Long Feiye remarked. “But it’ll all be left to you for management afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doubtful, Han Yunxi scooted closer and asked, “Long Feiye, you...are you planning to run away?” He was acting so strangely that it made her uneasy. It was as if he was planning to settle everything before vanishing from sight. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye played with her hair as he gave her a pampering smile. “Even if I ran, I’d take you with me. Except if I was running for my life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi knocked his hand aside. “Long Feiye, just what are you planning to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You did so well managing Pill Fiend Pharmacy that your lordship can only count on your for my estates and properties too,” Long Feiye teased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not just talking about that,” Han Yunxi paused, then grew serious. “Do you have some plan in mind to deal with Celestial Mountain’s current conduct?” She only felt that Long Feiye was making preparations before their trip to Celestial Mountain for her sake because they’d be in danger then. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A complicated look flickered past Long Feiye’s face before he said lightly, “Their current actions are violent and dangerous. If I still can’t descend the mountain by mid-autumn, you can leave first and help me take care of the commander-in-chief’s estate here, as well as deal with developments in the western regions?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it because of Duanmu Yao?” Han Yunxi grew anxious. </span><i><span style>Would Long Feiye’s actions make him the sword sect master’s enemy because of that girl? </span></i><span style>In her impression, he had always respected his master even with Duanmu Yao causing trouble. Celestial Mountain Sword Sect’s grandmaster was the number one expert across the continent. His martial arts had reached unfathomable heights. If her guesses were right, then he’d really be in peril.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It has nothing to do with her. Cang Qiuzi is the biggest source of trouble,” Long Feiye replied. In truth, even that man was number two. His primary obstacle laid with himself--or rather, the lock still sealed in his body. If he could smoothly get rid of it on their trip to Celestial Mountain, then it’d be easy to take care of Cang Qiuzi as well. In the </span><i><span style>jianghu’s </span></i><span style>martial arts circles, strength directly determined the successors as kings. It wasn’t as complicated or variable as the royal courts. Meanwhile, he’d never taken Duanmu Yao to heart, nor was he planning to let her return to the mountain. As long as she didn’t come back, master wouldn’t have any conflicts with him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he obtained the power to speak for Celestial Mountain, none of Cloud Realm’s martial arts circles would dare to threaten the south central regions and its commander-in-chief’s estate. He could also use the martial arts circles’ strength in the future to take down the two mercenary cities under his command. He always knew that the strength of the </span><i><span style>jianghu </span></i><span style>couldn’t be underestimated. Duanmu Yao’s efforts to rally their forces against Ning Cheng was already clear proof of their power. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Celestial Mountain’s current actions would have far-reaching effects. While the three nations were busy fighting in the western regions for the next few months, visiting them would be the best idea. If they didn’t move now, Heaven knows what Duanmu Yao and Cang Qiuzi would end up teaming with Jun Yixie or worse. Cang Qiuzi had always wanted to gain support from the secular world to buff up his power at Celestial Mountain. Since Jun Yixie and Duanmu Yao had already colluded in the past, connecting the man with Cang Qiuzi would wrest the situation beyond Long Feiye’s control. That was one thing that couldn’t happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he couldn’t unseal his lock, then things would be even more complicated. Both him and Han Yunxi would be in danger. Thus, he would send Han Yunxi off the mountain at mid-autumn first even if he couldn’t leave himself. All of the arrangements had been made. Now he was winding up things at the commander-in-chief’s estate. If he couldn’t return, Han Yunxi would be safest here. She now had all of his business accounts books for the south central regions. Even if all five clan heads tried to pressure her, she would have enough chips to contend against them. Although it looked like she was going to control the situation in his place, there wouldn’t be much for her to do in actuality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to leave the mountain. You can leave the affairs at the commander-in-chief’s estate to Baili Yuanlong. I’m going with you up </span><i><span style>and </span></i><span style>down that peak! If you don’t leave, I won’t either!” Han Yunxi said seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t know martial arts. You’ll just be a burden for your lordship if you stay behind,” Long Feiye said ruthlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi wouldn’t be defeated by just one sentence. “Even so, I’ll stick around. If you have the skills to bring me up, then you have the skills to come back down with me! Otherwise, don’t bring me at all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then don’t go,” Long Feiye said, but his eyes were soft and bright. It was obvious he was humoring her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Long Feiye!” </span><i><span style>How could he say such cruel things in such a gentle voice? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Unperturbed, Long Feiye tenderly fed her another spoonful of soup. She huffed as she drank it all and said, “Fine, I won’t go. I’ll wait at South Ning until you come back!” After some thought, she added, “And if you don’t dare to return, I’ll make the commander-in-chief’s estate break up and scatter Chu Xifeng and the rest. Then I’ll sell all your properties and estates to Cloud Realm Trade Consortium and go wander the world with Gu Qishao!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her angry words were also acting as a warning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And also, I’ll go to the Tang Clan and---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, my mother and father are already dead. I want to bring you to Celestial Mountain so master can meet you,” Long Feiye’s gentle gaze didn’t stop. Han Yunxi abruptly shut up. She didn’t want to meet those eyes, but was drawn to them anyways. How could she refuse something so soft?</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could she refute a reason like that? Besides, it wasn’t like she didn’t want to go. She too, was hoping for the day when she could join him on Celestial Mountain. She’d held this wish for so long that she wouldn’t drop it now, especially when he was going to face danger. Han Yunxi stared at him intently without a word. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye ended up smiling helplessly as he played with her bangs again. “After mid-autumn, the grain and medicine supplies for the three nations will be exhausted. Someone will need to be present to oversee things at the south central regions then. Baili Yuanlong is a military man thorough and thorough; he’s not as smart as you. Your lordship will only come down the mountain a little later, if at that. It’s not like I’ll never leave it again.” He cupped her by the chin as he spoke, lifting her face to meet his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, just what kind of foolish fancies are you thinking of? You want to wander the world with Gu Qishao? Why didn’t you tell me earlier? Do you believe that your lordship will break his legs right now until he’s a cripple?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Somewhere else, Gu Qishao had finally broken free from Mu Linger and was curled up inside his wide black robes beneath the sun. A sudden chill went down his back before he peeked his head outside. The sun was still shining brightly, so he only ended up feeling confused…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi looked at Long Feiye before she finally replied, “You said it yourself, it’s going to be dangerous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s why,” Long Feiye replied smoothly, “I won’t be able to descend so soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care. I’m not going down first!” Han Yunxi was in a rare stubborn mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye knitted his brows. He didn’t speak, but simply stared at Han Yunxi. His cold gaze was enough to scare all the servant girls. They feared that a single misstep would land disaster on their heads. But Han Yunxi furrowed her brows as well and matched his stare. The two of them ended up in a deadlock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Han Yunxi stood up and turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait!” Long Feiye called her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no discussion for this matter. I can find someone else to take care of South Ning’s commander-in-chief’s estate. I don’t need to come back personally to oversee everything,” Han Yunxi said coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, she already had a candidate in mind: Gu Beiyue. He had survived years in Tianning’s Imperial Physician Courtyard without ill effects, which meant his intelligence extended beyond just medicine. With time, he could analyze the current situation well. Once they shared their plans with him, she trusted Gu Beiyue wouldn’t disappoint them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was about to leave when Long Feiye coaxed gently, “Han Yunxi, do you still want to eat? Come here, don’t starve your stomach.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi paused. </span><i><span style>How am I supposed to stay mad when he’s like this? How am I supposed to keep arguing?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes suddenly stung, and she felt like crying…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she could move, Long Feiye had already strode over to hug her from behind. “Alright, you win. Come and eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi spun around and stared at him. “You can’t lie to people!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Can’t lie to people? </span></i><span style>It wasn’t as if he hadn’t lied to her before. Long Feiye kissed her forehead as a stamp of promise. “Then you’ll accompany your lordship wherever I go, how’s that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi finally smiled. “Alright, I’ll tie you up with a rope!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the servants sucked in a cold breath at her words. </span><i><span style>That’s too bold, even for Qin Wangfei! Isn’t she just cursing His Highness Duke of Qin as a dog?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But Long Feiye didn’t get angry. He simply pulled Han Yunxi back to the table, where they continued to have their lunch. The two of them tacitly agreed to drop the subject from before. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was no fool. She was already telling herself to take precautions. When mid-autumn passed, she would have to be extra careful and keep a closer eye on Long Feiye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you going to make any preparations for the extortion letter?” Han Yunxi asked as she changed the topic. She had the courage to go with Long Feiye to exchange hostages, but worries still plagued her heart. Long Feiye, by contrast, didn’t seem bothered by it at all. They didn’t even know who their mighty opponent might be, so wasn’t he being a bit too calm?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s nothing worth preparing for,” Long Feiye replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Suppose the other side didn’t only hire Lady Leng Yue, but Qi Zonglin as well? Wouldn’t we be going to our deaths then?” Han Yunxi wasn’t joking. In the past, they had ran into both Leng Shuangshuang and Qi Yaotian while hunting down Mama Su. Long Feiye’s current skills were more than enough to deal with those two, but he was bringing her along, a woman who didn’t know martial arts. If he had to face two city lords at the same time, then it was simply seeking death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your lordship is only bringing you along. No matter what happens there, your lordship will take care of defense while you attack. How does killing them all with poison sound?” Long Feiye asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi’s eyes lit up like a lantern, shimmering and bright. When she had teamed up with Long Feiye against the Chu Clan archers, even that was more than enough! If no Driving Arrow Arts were involved, Long Feiye could bring her right up to the enemy. At such proximity, she had plenty of ways to poison them. It didn’t always have to be hidden needles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright!” Han Yunxi rejoiced. Now she was even more curious to know who’d be the unlucky party to fall prey to their combined teamwork. In any case, his arrangements set her heart at rest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After lunch, the two of them drank tea with Baili Yuanlong before Long Feiye accompanied Han Yunxi to Pill Fiend Pharmacy. They entered through a side door, which took them past the treatment hall. It was very quiet there in the afternoons because all of the patients were resting. Long Feiye and Han Yunxi kept their footsteps light until they heard the sounds of an argument coming from inside a window. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss, you’re very pretty. What’s your name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi didn’t recognize this voice, but it definitely didn’t belong to anyone in Pill Fiend Pharmacy. </span><i><span style>Is it a patient flirting with another patient?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>While Long Feiye showed no interest in the snippet, Han Yunxi was curious enough to sneak a peek through the window. To her surprise, she saw someone trying to provoke Baili Mingxiang. Han Yunxi grabbed Long Feiye’s hand and murmured, “Look! That person has some nerve!”</span></p>
