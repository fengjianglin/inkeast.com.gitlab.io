 <p style="text-align: left;">Chapter <span style>692: I'll wait until he grows older</span><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for Han Yunxi that year, Lady Helian and Little Yi’er would have long been driven out of the house by Lady Xu, much less live until today. The Han Family owed Han Yunxi so much. She had striven to protect them even when her own life was at stake, just to save their most talented son. Lady Helian could admit that she once suspected Han Yunxi of doing everything to keep mother and son under her thrall. This way, all of the Han Estate’s pharmacopoeias, estates, and properties would belong to her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But Han Yunxi did no such thing. Everything she accomplished was for the sake of the Han Clan. She had taken care with Little Yi’er so that he could grow up as a man in his own right and shoulder the revival of the Han Estate’s pharmacies on his shoulders. Han Yunxi doted on Little Yi’er just as much as his own mother. Looking at the stubborn gaze in her son’s eyes now, Lady Helian only knitted her brows. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just what was she worrying about?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, she would always praise Little Yi’er for being a good boy whenever he said he wanted to repay his older sister. She even taught him not to be ungrateful. Today, however, she was filled with nothing but anxiety. She wasn’t afraid of anything except losing this son. That’s why there were certain things she could only keep to herself!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seventh Mother, what are you spacing out for? Come here and drink tea,” Han Yunxi might be the high and lofty Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>but she always treated Lady Helian with the respect due a senior member of the family. By ranks alone, she was supposed to call Helian Zuixiang ‘Seventh Mother’ to reflect her status as her father’s seventh concubine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Helian went over and pulled Little Yi’er into her lap. Like always, she asked after Han Yunxi’s health and spoke of the Han Estate’s four pharmacies and how they were doing. After a while, Han Yunxi said they should let Gu Beiyue rest and they all left together. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as they exited the courtyard, Lady Helian asked in a low voice, “Yunxi, it’s been so many years already. Why isn’t there any news from your stomach yet?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Urk…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi wasn’t expecting this. Although she knew plenty of people were interested in the answer, no one had ever asked her again after her last interrogation at Tianning’s New Year’s banquet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It </span><i><span style>is </span></i><span style>about time for some news…” she muttered to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Highness Duke of Qin...doesn’t want children?” Lady Helian’s voice dropped even lower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi just laughed. “He’s too busy to have any time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then when will he?” Lady Helian murmured. “His Highness Duke of Qin is grown now, and no longer a child.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Probably not in the next year and a half. I’m busy as well…” This wasn’t an excuse, but the truth. How could she stay idle while Long Feiye was so busy? Two days later, she’d have to keep the appointment to rescue Grand Concubine Yi. A few days after that, they were to go to Celestial Mountain. Both were dangerous tasks. In the meantime, she had to train her poison storage space to break through the third rank so she could be more helpful to Long Feiye. There was barely any time to flirt or date, much less birth a child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking up to here made Han Yunxi laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you laughing about?” Lady Helian didn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing. You should busy yourselves, I’m going to find Linger!” Han Yunxi said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Helian stayed put. “Yunxi, there’s war and chaos in the north. Will you two stay for good this time? South Ning’s such a nice place, so stop putting yourselves in danger all the time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go wherever Long Feiye goes. Nothing’s dangerous with him around,” Han Yunxi teased. She wasn’t planning to tell anyone unrelated of their trip to Celestial Mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is true what they say, a married off daughter is like spilt water that can’t be brought back!” Lady Helian was helpless, but Little Yi’er was quite happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right! With His Highness Duke of Qin here, big sister won’t be in any danger. Mother, you can stop worrying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yunxi, come to Han Estate for dinner tonight, won’t you?” Lady Helian asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I still have things to do tonight. Maybe another day,” Han Yunxi refused. Lady Helian didn’t press her and left with Little Yi’er in tow. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mother, you go back first. I’ll come home at night, I want to show master a whole bunch of illness cases,” Little Yi’er said seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A complicated look flickered past Lady Helian’s eyes before she murmured, “Yi’er, why don’t you stay at Pill Fiend Pharmacy tonight? Mother will come pick you up tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Yi’er immediately shook his head. “Big sister Chen Xiang isn’t at the estate. I have to stay with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silly boy, mother’s going to pay a trip to the temple. I might stay there overnight. You just be good and stay with Doctor Gu. Mother will come pick you right up tomorrow morning,” Lady Helian said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mother, why are you staying in the temple?” Little Yi’er didn’t understand. In the past, his mother would never stay outside the estate overnight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s a religious assembly at the temple tonight,” Lady Helian explained as she rubbed his forehead with a smile. “Since when have children asked so many questions? You should hurry up and help out at the pharmacy instead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Yi’er didn’t think much of her answer and bounced away to do as he was told. With both master and big sister back again, he felt that the world was a beautiful place. Lady Helian only exhaled and hurried out. Su Xiaoyu happened to pass by and felt bewildered by her harried state. She chased after the woman a few steps before losing her around a curve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lady Helian? What’s the rush, is she hurrying to her next reincarnation?” Su Xiaoyu muttered to herself. She headed for the pharmacy next, where she saw Mu Linger personally checking the inventory with Little Yi’er helping on the side. Han Yunxi was nowhere to be seen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Han Yunxi had doubled back to find Gu Beiyue again. When she said the man needed rest, it was only an excuse to send away Lady Helian and Little Yi’er. Gu Beiyue was again steeping tea by the time she returned, and her cup was still on the table. It was obvious that he knew she’d come back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a pity that Doctor Gu isn’t playing the role of adviser instead of doctor,” Han Yunxi teased his perception skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s only because I’ve stayed long enough in the palace to get used to reading people’s expressions. Now it’s habit for me to notice the little things,” Gu Beiyue said modestly. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>is there something to discuss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Highness and I are going to Celestial Mountain at the start of next month, and it’ll...be a dangerous journey,” Han Yunxi got straight to the point. If she and Long Feiye could leave the peak by mid-autumn, that would be best. But if not, then Gu Beiyue would be the most trustworthy person to leave in charge of affairs down here. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, Gu Beiyue had long learned of the Celestial Mountain trip from Long Feiye just then. But still, he feigned a face full of shock. “What...but His Highness Duke of Qin is the sword sect master’s closed door disciple! Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>what has happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those are internal matters of the sword sect,” Han Yunxi paused, before adding. “Gu Beiyue, you should be very clear on the unrest between the three nations right now. The situation at the commander-in-chief’s estate here in South Ning…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi summarized the current events while mentioning Northern Li as a threat and the Baili Navy’s strength currently holding them in check. Gu Beiyue patiently waited for her to finish taling before he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>to tell this one so much, I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If His Highness and I aren’t off the mountain by mid-autumn, then I ask that you help General Baili over at the commander-in-chief’s estate. He’s a soldier after all, and not well versed in the art of politics,” Han Yunxi murmured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue smiled helplessly. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>this one is only a doctor…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A doctor cures the heart, which in turn cures the nation and the world. All of these things can be treated!” Han Yunxi was serious, her eyes shining bright. “Gu Beiyue, just treat it as me--”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she could say </span><i><span style>‘begging,’ </span></i><span style>Gu Beiyue cut her off. He never wanted to hear Han Yunxi asking him for favors. He didn’t like the phrasing, nor did he have the right to accept. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yunxi, do you know? I am wholly at your bidding.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>A doctor cures the heart, the nation, and the world? Yunxi, I only hate the fact that I couldn’t cure myself or recover my martial arts in time to protect you completely!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I am indebted to esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>for thinking so highly of me. If needed, this one shall do his utmost to cooperate with General Baili,” Gu Beiyue clasped his hands respectfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe you,” Han Yunxi trusted her own judgment, but her intuition even more. Both of them ended up chatting over inane topics before Mu Linger found the pair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should really rest now, I’ve disturbed you,” Han Yunxi said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue had his share of trauma listening to Mu Linger and Gu Qi Sha argue the whole way here, so he didn’t ask Han Yunxi to stay. Han Yunxi ended up pushing Mu Linger out the courtyard as soon as she stepped in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s Gu Qishao?” Han Yunxi asked first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Linger rolled her eyes at her. “I should be asking you!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s gone. Probably won’t be back for a while, so you don’t need to wait,” Han Yunxi admitted. “When you have time, take a trip back to Medicine City to tidy up the Mu Clan. Don’t have Lady Lianxin gallavinating here instead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Linger’s limpid eyes dimmed at the words. She accompanied Han Yunxi into the flower gardens in silence until she inexplicably grasped her by the wrist. Han Yunxi glanced at her fingers, but kept quiet. After walking for awhile, Mu Linger finally spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is it so hard to like someone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tired?” Han Yunxi asked lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exhausted,” Mu Linger admitted. “It’s been years, but all he does is run while I chase him. I’ve almost ran the length of Cloud Realm Continent by now, but I just can’t catch him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You won’t be tired if you stopped liking him, right?” Han Yunxi herself didn’t understand it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll die! I’d die if I stopped liking him!” Mu Linger blinked resolutely. Han Yunxi had nothing to add to that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not worth it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then will you stop liking Long Feiye one day?” Mu Linger asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve never thought about that,” Han Yunxi would never entertain the thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aiya, you guys are different from us!” Mu Linger hung her head, depressed. But in the end she looked up again, face filled with pride. “Hmph, I’ll wait! I’ll wait until he grows older. There’ll come a day when he won’t have the strength to run!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Linger raised her head to stare at the skies. The clean and gentle warmth of sunlight from the fourth month spread over her small, stubborn face. Her heart was as solid as gold as her eyes shimmered with determination over her upturned lips. At the prime of youth, she looked lovely! </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gu Qishao, Linger will wait for you. Until the earth grows old and the skies desolate, until the seas turn into endless fields, until everything flourishing dwindles and fades, until years give way to calm.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But Gu Qishao, just when will you...grow older?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunx didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as she looked at Mu Linger. “Mm, that’s a good idea!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m serious!” Mu Linger exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know, I know,” Han Yunxi nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>When night fell, Han Yunxi called over Su Xiaoyu before leaving Pill Fiend Pharmacy to give the blood mushroom to Mu Linger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, this is a precious item! You should leave it for yourself!” Su Xiaoyu might worship Mu Linger, but she always saved the best things for Han Yunxi first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Excellency Pill Fiend gave it to her. Give it over,” Han Yunxi ordered crisply. Su Xiaoyu rubbed her nose before doing as she was told. Although these methods were too much like meddling in other people’s business, Han Yunxi really did feel distress for Mu Linger’s sake. Which woman wouldn’t grow foolish in the name of love?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps the ones who didn’t were only the ones who feared getting heart, or the women who had stopped believing in love altogether. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw Long Feiye coming her way, Han Yunxi stopped thinking such thoughts. She knew that she was plenty foolish in front of him. On their trip back home, she held his hand tightly. Two days later, they would follow the ransom note directions to arrive at Lost Void Lake…</span></p>
