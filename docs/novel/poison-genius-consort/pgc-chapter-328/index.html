 <p>Chapter 328: With regards to being biased&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>History had multiple accounts of sovereigns being enamoured with their lovers and missing morning court sessions as a result. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Emperor Tianhui had come to Noble Consort Yun’s quarters as soon as his morning court session adjourned. His actions were understandable to some extent, Han Yunxi thought, if his target was Chu Qingge. She suspected that he wouldn’t let the girl go so easily. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>came to see how you’re both doing your investigations. Ask and examine as you need, there’s no need to have any misgivings,” Emperor Tianhui said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Han Yunxi replied with a single syllable, but Chu Qingge was far more enthusiastic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since Your Majesty is so open-minded, Qingge will do her best to uncover the truth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi couldn’t help but roll her eyes. </span><i><span style>What, so you won’t try your best if Emperor Tianhui didn’t show up? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>believes you!” Emperor Tianhui had a meaningful look in his eyes. Chu Qingge nodded. She was about to interrogate some more court ladies when Emperor Tianhui added, “Miss Chu, if there’s anything you need help with, you can ask </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>directly. </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>will definitely give you assistance without delay.” He’d long left Han Yunxi to dry in the sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Your Majesty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If this was in the past, Chu Qingge would have long noticed something off with Emperor Tianhui’s gaze. But her mind was filled with thoughts of competing against Han Yunxi now. As long as there was a chance to beat Han Yunxi and show off &nbsp;before her, she’d use it without hesitation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Qingge’s honor to receive such trust from the emperor,” Chu Qingge said as she intentionally raised her voice. The empress dowager might have pushed Han Yunxi to the forefront, but Chu Qingge couldn’t believe that old woman was sincere. She guessed that the empress dowager had a trap lying in wait for Han Yunxi. Emperor Tianhui was even less likely to help the woman out. Maybe he was preparing a trap, too! Even if she herself didn’t have the empress dowager’s support, Emperor Tianhui’s trust was already enough to give her a one-up on Han Yunxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So what if Han Yunxi was Long Feiye’s proper consort? So what if the rumors said that Long Feiye doted on her? Long Feiye was such a cold and busy man. How was it possible for him to always be at Han Yunxi’s side and help her out with everything? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qingge’s voice was so loud that Han Yunxi would’ve felt embarrassed for her sake if she didn’t at least look over. She gave the girl a bewildered glance, wondering what she was so smug about. </span><i><span style>Doesn’t she know that it’s not an honor to gain Emperor Tianhui’s trust? It’s actually her misfortune.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Aye…” Han Yunxi sighed lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>His Majesty’s definitely set his sights on that girl!” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>couldn’t help but whisper. Being an experienced former servant of the imperial palace, she’d naturally noticed those details. In fact, she’d noticed as early as Chu Qingge’s </span><i><span style>qin </span></i><span style>performance at the birthday banquet, but she hadn’t paid it any mind at the time. After seeing Emperor Tianhui’s gaze in person today, she was 100 percent convinced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi signaled Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>to be quiet before she entered the inner rooms. She figured that Emperor Tianhui already hated her enough, so she shouldn’t stick around and ruin his romantic pursuits. But Chu Qingge felt restless as soon as Han Yunxi slipped away. </span><i><span style>Why did she leave? Is it because she can’t stand it anymore?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, Qingge will look around a bit inside. Please excuse my absence,” Chu Qingge said respectfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on,” Emperor Tianhui smiled slightly, looking very amiable. By the time Chu Qingge turned around, he was still admiring her delicate, appealing figure. When she walked, her steps were lithe and graceful. Eventually, a satisfied curve rose onto his lips. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heheh, the more I see, the more satisfied I feel.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Chu Qingge entered the rooms, she noticed that Han Yunxi didn’t seem to be examining anything. She was actually sitting in a corner and whispering something in Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>ear. Mistress and servant were both wreathed in smiles. At her entrance, Han Yunxi only cast her a single glance. Even when Chu Qingge settled to sit right across from her, Han Yunxi ignored her in favor of small talk with Zhao </span><i><span style>mama. </span></i><span style>Chu Qingge listened for a while, but realized they were talking about trivial matters she didn’t understand that had no relation to the case. She assumed that Han Yunxi would say something when she came in, but that wasn’t the case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while of sitting, Chu Qingge began to feel somewhat awkward. She put down her lofty attitude and asked coldly, “Han Yunxi, judging from your state, you’ve found something out, haven’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope,” Han Yunxi didn’t elaborate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Emperor Tianhui believes in me so much. Aren’t you afraid?” Chu Qingge asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not afraid.” Han Yunxi only answered her questions, but offered no explanations of her own. It was obvious that she didn’t want to talk with Chu Qingge at all. But Chu Qingge dearly wanted to know whether Han Yunxi minded Emperor Tianhui’s obvious bias. More than that, she wanted to know what kind of charm she possessed, to keep Long Feiye by her side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, you don’t really think that old empress dowager is on your side, do you? Even if she does want to help you, I estimate that…” Chu Qingge lowered her voice in a facsimile of goodwill, “When I came to the palace this morning, I heard that the empress dowager’s palace lost a great deal of treasures. She’s vexed beyond belief, searching for them everywhere. She doesn’t have time to worry about anything else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At her words, both Han Yunxi and Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>burst into uncontrollable laughter. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Lil Thing was amazing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qingge was completely at a loss. “Han Yunxi, what you two laughing about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Han Yunxi’s reply was as simple as ever. “Nothing much.” After that, she kept on joking with Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>talking about a whole heap of things as she ignored Chu Qingge. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qingge had come with full intentions to show off her strength, but her proud heart suddenly felt a sense of inferiority from being ignored. She gritted her teeth and left filled with hate. </span><i><span style>Han Yunxi, just you wait!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as she went outside, she saw Emperor Tianhui drinking tea. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Chu, would you like to take a break?” Emperor Tianhui asked thoughtfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Chu Qingge sensed that something was amiss. She felt a bit strange, but she was too preoccupied to pursue the matter. “Many thanks for Your Majesty’s kindness, but Qingge needs to seize this time to question more court ladies. There’s quite a few I still need to find.” Chu Qingge was very earnest. She spent all morning interrogating court ladies, asking for the most minute of details. She even repeated a few of her questions just in case the court ladies were lying. She had no idea that Emperor Tianhui had been watching her the entire time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qingge was both industrious and diligent, but Han Yunxi spent her entire morning sitting down to gossip with Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>who told her lots of funny stories and scandals of the imperial palace. Han Yunxi wasn’t being lazy, she’d just finished examining most of what she needed to investigate. She’d checked Noble Consort Yun’s body, asked the court ladies a few questions, and generally knew where things stood. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Emperor Tianhui only left when it was nearly noon, but had someone send a sumptous lunch to Chu Qingge. It even had fruit for an after-lunch dessert. Han Yunxi and Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>had to wait for the sedan chair to take them back to their living quarters to eat. Their temporary residence at the palace was rather far from Noble Consort Yun’s quarters. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qingge sat alone at her table, elegantly enjoying a table full of delectable, delicious-smelling delicacies. Meanwhile, Han Yunxi and Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>were left waiting by the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei. </span></i><span style>This old servant used silver to ensure the sedan chair arrives quickly. I’ve also arranged the palace’s famous flower feast for you,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>murmured in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine, I’m not hungry,” Han Yunxi said honestly. With an old hand of the harem like Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>by her side, she’d eaten and lived very well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, by the time Chu Qingge finished her meal, there was still no sign of their sedan chair. Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>immediately understood what was going on. She cried angrily, “Those despicable calves! They took the silver but didn’t do the work! Don’t think they can underestimate this old servant just because I’m not in the palace anymore! I was here before the empress dowager was an empress dowager, before the emperor was an emperor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi felt her mouth twitch at the sight of Zhao </span><i><span style>mama. </span></i><span style>She never thought the woman had such a bold side to her personality. Inexplicably, she began to imagine the past. The empress dowager and Grand Concubine Yi, Emperor Tianhui and the Duke of Qin--they must have been embroiled in palace schemes of life and death back then. But Long Feiye should’ve been very young.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Aiya, </span></i><span style>how come you two are still here?” Chu Qingge’s voice rose up. Han Yunxi turned to see the girl walking towards them. Behind her, various court ladies were cleaning up the table of half-finished food. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi ignored her and murmured, “Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>why don’t we walk there instead? We have nothing to do anyways.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qingge saw that they were about to leave and laughed out loud. “Han Yunxi, if you two are hungry, I can tell them to hold on clearing the table. You can eat what’s left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>lost her temper. There was nothing cute about this Miss Chu at all. Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>hadn’t bothered her all morning, so why did she keep picking on them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Chu, the mistress of this palace only passed away recently, and yet you’re eating an ostentatious meal in her very hall. Aren’t you afraid she’ll find you at night to demand her share?” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>tone was very serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qingge felt a chill wind at her back after hearing those words. She subconsciously darted her head towards the coffin and spirit tablet in the main hall, where Noble Consort Yun lay at rest. Immediately, she felt her hairs stand on end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old servant, what kind of nonsense are you spewing? That meal was awarded by His Majesty! Are you saying His Majesty’s made a mistake with his conduct?” Chu Qingge replied sternly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Chu, you keep mentioning His Majesty left and right. Noble Consort Yun won’t be happy to hear that. She was always a type who liked to eat vinegar, don’t you know?” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>reminded her faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, Chu Qingge’s hairs stood on end. Still, her mouth refused to admit defeat. “What, are you guys jealous that His Majesty’s biased in my favor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>laughed. “What kind of things is Miss Chu saying? Everyone in the palace knows that His Majesty’s just and impartial. How could he be biased in your favor? Now if you’re talking frequent biases, my family’s Duke of Qin is precisely such a man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi wasn’t even planning to speak up at this point. For the first time, she realized how amusing it was to have Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>by her side! Most likely, Chu Qingge hadn’t caught the true meaning behind the </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>words. Everyone in the palace knew Emperor Tianhui was just and impartial. If word spread that he was favoring Chu Qingge, she’d have a tough time of it during her stay here! The infighting between females of the imperial harem was even more terrifying than the struggles between men of the court. They could be callously cruel. It was impossible for the emperor to show them all equal consideration; otherwise, why would so many harem members meet with tragic deaths or unexpected miscarriages?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, Chu Qingge didn’t catch the implication in Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>words at all. She laughed coldly and said, “Is that so? Then why haven’t we seen His Highness Duke of Qin coming over to deliver lunch? Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>I heard that His Highness Duke of Qin dotes on you. As it turns out, rumors are just rumors in the end!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, as soon as Chu Qingge finished speaking, a eunuch by the gates loudly announced, “His Highness Duke of Qin arrives!”</span></p>
