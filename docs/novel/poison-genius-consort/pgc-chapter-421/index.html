 <p>Chapter&nbsp;<span>421: Does this count as protecting you?</span>&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span>Han Yunxi soundlessly fainted on top of Baili Mingxiang, causing the detox system to grind to a halt. Nothing had gone wrong with it </span><i><span>this</span></i><span> time. Its owner was just far too exhausted for it to continue running. The morning that Baili Mingxiang had gotten into trouble just happened to be right after she’d pulled an all-nighter. Over the past five days, she and Long Feiye were too busy hurrying back and forth on the road. Though she had caught a few snatches of sleep in his arms, it wasn’t much after being up all night, working. With a human life at stake, she couldn’t relax enough to sleep. Moreover, she could hardly rest soundly when Long Feiye was working so hard to gain them the necessary speed.</span></p>
 <p><span>The insides of her brain had been stretched extremely taut over the last few days from tiredness and neglect. Thus, the moment she let down her guard, her body just collapsed. Outside the room, Long Feiye stood facing the courtyard, his hands clasped behind his back. General Baili paced back and forth, the two of them forming an unofficial guard. </span></p>
 <p><span>After a while had passed with no noticeable reaction from inside, General Baili couldn’t help but to ask, “Your Highness, now that the medicine’s here, everything should be fine, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span>General Baili dearly wished for His Highness Duke of Qin to go inside and take a look. </span><i><span>Esteemed wangfei might lose her temper when others disturbed her, but His Highness Duke of Qin should be an exception to that rule. </span></i></p>
 <p><span>“Mm,” Long Feiye replied. Generally speaking, he had always been asked out of the room when Han Yunxi was doing any of her treatments, regardless of who the patient was. Not once had he witnessed her at work. General Baili started to speak up, paused, and gave up only to resume his pacing back and forth.</span></p>
 <p><span>The two of them waited and waited until they heard someone suddenly cry out, “Someone! Someone come, ah!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span>That’s Baili Mingxiang’s voice! What’s going on?! What could have possibly happened in there?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Before General Baili had even recovered his senses, Long Feiye was already shoving open the doors! The first thing he saw was Baili Mingxiang sitting up in bed with an unconscious Han Yunxi laid across her legs, his face filled with alarm before he found himself at a loss. Baili Mingxiang panicked as His Highness Duke of Qin headed her way with a stormy expression on his frosty face. </span></p>
 <p><span>Long Feiye picked up Han Yunxi and nestled her protectively against his chest before he demanded, “What happened here?!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Baili Mingxiang looked up and saw the bloodshot eyes and icy expression of His Highness Duke of Qin up close and was frightened mute. She had only just woken up, so the last things she remembered were her memories from several days ago. She had no idea what could have happened. Impatience flitted across Long Feiye’s eyes at Baili Mingxiang’s reaction. He raised his voice and roared, “Baili Yuanlong, go find your lordship a doctor!”</span></p>
 <p><span>General Baili had just entered the room and was equally shocked by the scene before his eyes. He naturally assumed that it was his daughter who was in trouble, but it was actually esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei! </span></i><span>Fortunately, the doctors were all still nearby, so he found one very quickly. All of the physicians at the estate held His Highness Duke of Qin in reverence and awe, so the one that came in couldn’t keep his knees from going weak when they entered to see his frigid, murderous expression. He took a few deep breaths to calm himself before finally checking the patient’s pulse. As the room grew silent, Baili Mingxiang calmed down as well. Although she had absolutely no idea what had happened over the past few days, she knew that esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei </span></i><span>must have come in order to save her.</span></p>
 <p><span>After figuring out his diagnosis, the doctor’s heart sank back down in his chest. “Your Highness, please set your mind at ease. Esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei </span></i><span>has only collapsed from overexhaustion, so she’ll wake up after sufficient rest. It shouldn’t be anything serious.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Thank goodness it wasn’t anything serious. Otherwise, he might just kick me out of this room. His Highness Duke of Qin is wearing a ghastly expression right now!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Long Feiye pursed his lips into a thin, cold line. He cradled Han Yunxi close in his arms and prepared to leave when General Baili spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Mingxiang, hurry up and thank His Highness and esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei. </span></i><span>If they hadn’t traveled nonstop for five days and five nights to find you medicine, you would’ve died already!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Five days and five nights? Nonstop traveling? His Highness went as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span>So the reason esteemed wangfei fainted from exhaustion was all my fault? And the reason that His Highness’s eyes look so bloodshot is because I tired him out as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Baili Mingxiang’s heart clenched like a giant hand was squeezing it. Ignoring her weak body, she hastened off the bed to kneel on the cold, hard floor and kowtow her head to the floor. “Many thanks to Your Highness Duke of Qin and esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei </span></i><span>for saving my life!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Long Feiye ignored her as she struck her forehead against the floor, refusing to reply in favor of take large strides out the door. He wasn’t even interested in knowing whether Baili Mingxiang had taken her medicine properly, much less if she’d recovered. Long after they had left, Baili Mingxiang remained kneeling until General Baili pulled her up to have a doctor examine her.</span></p>
 <p><span>The doctor marveled at her state after doing a thorough examination. “Imperial Physician Gu’s prescription really is very marvelous. No major ailments are plaguing young Miss. You’re only very weak right now, so you need time to recover and rest your body.”</span></p>
 <p><span>General Baili rejoiced upon hearing the news and rewarded the doctor before dismissing him. Bail Mingxiang finally spoke up. “Father, His Highness, he---”</span></p>
 <p><span>Naturally, a father was privy to his daughter’s thoughts. General Baili told her everything that had happened in the past few days, including the updates on the Beauty’s Blood.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You just had to go and be disobedient! Esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei </span></i><span>told you specifically to take your poisons slowly, but you just </span><i><span>had </span></i><span>to eat them all in one go! You were lucky that esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei </span></i><span>was only exhausted this time. If anything had happened to her, see what would’ve become of you!” General Baili rebuked her.</span></p>
 <p><span>Baili Mingxiang’s head drooped as she accepted his lecture. She hadn’t meant to eat 10 days’ worth of poisons all in one go. But that fateful day, she’d been unable to bear the agony of her poisons acting up again and had lost all sense of reason. In her pain-addled haze, she’d simply gobbled up all the poisons that were in sight until her memories turned blurry.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was very difficult to describe certain types of pain without experiencing them personally. She knew that any further explanation would be useless, because other people would only accuse her of being quarrelsome and contentious. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Have you forgotten? The fate of our Baili Clan is to obey without question!” General Baili roared. Though he felt distressed for his daughter’s sake, the duties of the clan were paramount. </span></p>
 <p><span>Baili Mingxiang raised her head, her gaze steady. “Daughter knows her wrongs, may father punish me as he sees fit.”</span></p>
 <p><span>General Baili exhaled. “Stop running off with flights of fancy. Just take care of your body until you recover fully. I’ll find you a servant girl and </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>to wait on you afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The corner of Baili Mingxiang’s eyes stung as she quickly lowered her head. After all these years, this was the first time her father had spoken such words. General Baili rose and made to leave, but stopped to add, “Mingxiang, since you’ve managed to preserve your life, it’s about time father arranged for your marriage affairs as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span>No daughter of a large clan ever had a say in who she was to marry. Each wedding was an investment, because marrying a girl was equal to gaining the strength of her clan. The logic applied to the family marrying out their daughter as well. General Baili’s other daughters had all married off to various powerful families, expanding their sphere of influence. Baili Mingxiang was the Baili Clan’s youngest daughter but also the one in most demand. If she was willing and able to marry, she’d definitely draw powerful forces to their side as allies.</span></p>
 <p><span>Baili Mingxiang hung her head and didn’t reply. Marriage was more than a discussion that would en in a few days, so General Baili’s words were only a reminder for now. He left as soon as he finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span>Meanwhile, Long Feiye had summoned Gu Beiyue as soon as he arrived at the Duke of Qin’s estate. Although he held reservations against the man personally, he trusted his medical skills above all the other doctors in Tianning’s capital city. Gu Beiyue’s skills were such that he could tell exactly what was wrong with Han Yunxi without even taking her pulse. Naturally, he made a show of doing it anyways in addition to a simple examination. Only then did he announce the diagnosis to be simple overexhaustion.</span></p>
 <p><span>He creased his brows as he spoke, “Your Highness, esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei </span></i><span>lost consciousness due to being tired out. She’s too exhausted.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“When will she wake up?” Long Feiye asked coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s hard to say!” Gu Beiyue grew serious. “Your Highness, in typical cases the patient only sleeps for one to two days. But in severe cases…”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Well?” Long Feiye was obviously becoming anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gu Beiyue retreated with a bow, his hands clasped before his chest. “In severe cases, the patient might never wake up!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span>SLAM!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>That was the sound of Long Feiye’s fist slamming into the table, splitting the ebony tea stand into many pieces on the floor. Zhao </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>and Su Xiaoyu both had quite a fright as they stood to the side, too afraid to come forward and clean up the mess.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Which is her case?” Long Feiye asked Gu Beiyue angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Your Highness, please restrain your anger. Esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei’s </span></i><span>case can’t be counted as severe. It’s impossible for this official to give you an exact time, but I estimate that she’ll wake up within three days. I ask that Your Highness remembers to remind esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei </span></i><span>not to overwork herself in the future. This official will write her a prescription. When esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei </span></i><span>wakes up, she can take the medicine often,” Gu Beiyue replied in a rush.</span></p>
 <p><span>Long Feiye finally exhaled in visible relief, the sound was especially loud in the quiet room. Zhao </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>couldn’t resist stealing a peek at her master. This was the first time his emotions had been written so clearly on his face! Gu Beiyue penned his prescription, which was filled with nothing but rare and precious ingredients. Many of them couldn’t even be found at the Imperial Physician Courtyard, but had to be ordered from speciality stores in Medicine City. Some ingredients were the only one of their kind in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span>For example, there was the Thousand Year Snow Lotus, Two-Thousand Year </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Ganoderma</span></a><span>, and three-year old </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codonopsis_pilosula" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span>dangshen</span></i></a><span>. Most people who possessed these ingredients kept them in storage rather than using them! Still, Gu Beiyue was confident that Long Feiye would find the ingredients for Han Yunxi as long as he wrote them on the prescription. In truth, he knew exactly when the woman would wake up, but exaggerated the situation on purpose so Han Yunxi could have more time to rest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Who else could keep this overactive woman at bay, besides Long Feiye himself? Han Yunxi, does it still count as protecting you if I find someone more capable than myself to stay by your side? </span></i></p>
 <p><span>As Gu Beiyue looked at Han Yunxi’s white face, he felt a twinge of pained reluctance in his heart. But in the end, he bid them farewell. Long Feiye glanced at the prescription before handing it over to Chu Xifeng. “Hurry and track down these ingredients. Your lordship wants three of each item on the list to start with!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Chu Xifeng was utterly dejected after reading the list. It was going to be nigh impossible to find even </span><i><span>one </span></i><span>of some of the things listed, but His Highness wanted three of each. And this was only </span><i><span>‘to start!’ Sobsob, </span></i><span>he only wished that esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei </span></i><span>would get well soon!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Your Highness, drink some water. Don’t exhaust yourself,” Zhao </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>carefully handed over a cup of warm water.</span></p>
 <p><span>Long Feiye quietly accepted the offering before indicating they should withdraw. As soon as Zhao </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>and Su Xiaoyu left, Long Feiye’s icy expression gradually softened. He looked at Han Yunxi with eyes filled with distress as his hand gently brushed past her face.</span></p>
 <p><span>In a helpless tone, he said, “As soon as your lordship got careless, this happened to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>In the past, he’d been so used to looking after himself and he never showed interest in others. But now, he realized that he had to look after this woman as well. His fingers rested softly against Han Yunxi’s lips before Long Feiye drank a mouthful of warm water and leaned in. He prepared to feed her the liquid mouth-to-mouth, only for...</span></p>
