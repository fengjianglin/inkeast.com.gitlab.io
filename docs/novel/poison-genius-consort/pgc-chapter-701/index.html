 <p style="text-align: left;">Chapter <span style>701: Yes, yes, that's it</span><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>As the Tear of Holding sank into the lake waters, it quickly vanished into the soundless depths. </span></p>
 <p><span style>An hour passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The poison within the pathway was still intact, but Long Feiye and Han Yunxi were both watching and waiting quietly by the lake. Time passed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suddenly!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ripples grew from the water before billows sprang up from the lake surface. One by one, they rose into the air, each bringing a single mermaid soldier. The column of water in the center towered over them all and revealed none other than Baili Yuanlong himself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When they fled Tianning’s capital city, it had been in the middle of the night, so Han Yunxi hadn’t seen a thing. Now was her first time seeing the Mermaid Clan’s true forms, causing her to cry out in shock. “It’s beautiful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed they were, with more defined features and pointed ears like dragons’ fins. Noble and dignified, they stood with elbow fins sharp enough to act as weapons. Light blue scales covered their bodies like armor, glittering in the light. Here was the face of a true noble clan. As they floated in the water, they resembled its most esteemed guards while bowing towards Long Feiye and Han Yunxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your subordinate arrived late to the rescue, may Your Highness mete punishment!” Baili Yuanlong was filled with fear. He knew His Highness Duke of Qin wouldn’t use the Tear of Holding unless it was absolutely necessary. Thus, he had immediately called upon his mermaid soldiers to rush into the opening of Lost Void Lake as quickly as he could.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not wise to tarry here long. Evacuate!” Long Feiye ordered coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Han Yunxi could react, Long Feiye had already grabbed her and jumped into the water. The special blue shield of the Mermaid Clan protected them as soon as they went underwater, allowing them to breathe as freely as on land. Mermaid soldiers took charge of Grand Concubine Yi and the various unconscious, poisoned members of the City of Daughters with them, thus clearing out the shores. They led the way with Baili Yuanlong personally shielding Long Feiye and Han Yunxi’s side. Their figures quickly vanished into the waters, which calmed and stilled in their wake. It was as if nothing had ever happened in the first place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One hour later, Bai Yanqing slowly opened his eyes and went for his stroll inside the pathway. He didn’t use any antidote before dispersing the poison completely. Despite witnessing this countless times, Bai Yuqiao still shrank back at the sight, fearful of the extent of her master’s powers.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The poison’s gone.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yanqing had hardly left the path when he realized something was wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’ve escaped!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yuqiao leapt to her feet. “Impossible! Master, I was on watch the entire time! They couldn’t have run away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi didn’t release any more poison. They’ve definitely fled,” Bai Yanqing muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, maybe Han Yunxi’s tired as well and needed to take a breath. Or maybe she’s all out of poisons by now,” Bai Yuqiao suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yanqing immediately filled the air with poisons. He waited a long time, but the toxins didn’t dispel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They must have ran away!” Bai Yanqing was convinced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, maybe Han Yunxi couldn’t dispel this on…” Before Bai Yuqiao could finish, Bai Yanqing had already dispelled his own poison and strode into the pathway. She hurried after him, too timid to coax him further even as she refused to accept his verdict. There was only one way in and out of the maze pathway to Lost Void Lake. She had stared at its exit for an entire hour. Could Han Yunxi and Long Feiye had slipped away before her very eyes? </span></p>
 <p><span style>She only accepted the truth when she and her master saw the abandoned shores of the lake. There wasn’t a single person left.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where did they go?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yuqiao couldn’t figure it out, but Bai Yanqing didn’t seem surprised. He stared at the lake for a long time before a cold smile rose to his lips. “Yes, yes…” he muttered to himself, “That’s it! This trip wasn’t a waste of time after all, hehe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yuqiao didn’t quite understand what was going on, but she was too afraid to ask despite her master looking like he was in a good mood. Indeed, Bai Yanqing was so pleased that he turned back and said with a smile, “Little lass, let’s go back. It’s about time for your senior brother’s letter to arrive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master and disciple left the pathway behind them just as Lady Leng Yue returned with Leng Shuangshuang. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Bai, so you were here! It certainly took me effort to find you! Hurry and help Shuang’er.” Lady Leng Yue knew that Bai Yanqing was nearby, but she’d searched the entire perimeter before doubling back to the maze. Fortunately, she happened to see his carriage parked by the road.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Bai Yanqing glanced over, Lady Leng Yue quickly approachd with an unconscious Leng Shuangshuang so he could take her pulse. Unfortunately, Bai Yuqiao blocked her way. Lady Leng Yue was about to scold her when Bai Yuqiao quickly found the place where Leng Shuangshuang had been poisoned: a tiny needle mark. Seeing this, Bai Yanqing remained silent and Lady Leng Yue relented without much choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yuqiao took out a dagger and marked the spot with a “十” before widening the incision. After that, she took out a magnetite in an attempt to pull out the poisoned needle buried deep within the flesh. But no matter how long she tried, the needle wouldn’t come out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprised, Bai Yuqiao cried, “Master, that Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei’s </span></i><span style>so wasteful! Her poison needles are made of solid gold. Even magnetites can’t attract them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many acupuncture needles in the medical world--poisoned or not--were called </span><i><span style>jinzhen </span></i><span style>(金针), which literally meant “gold needle.” But the gold was just a general term and not meant to be taken literally. A mixture of different metal alloys made them up, which was why they were attracted to magnets. It was rare to find truly gold needles, especially those used as weapons. Han Yunxi was probably the first of her kind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh, interesting.” Bai Yanqing was sitting in his carriage by now, flipping through a book and looking relaxed. Lady Leng Yue grew agitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happens if we can’t suck it out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yanqing remained silent, as did Bai Yuqiao. She simply took her dagger and drove it straight into the wound as it dripped with blood. Smoothly but harshly, she dug the needle out. Despite being a girl who often felt distress for her senior brother, she was quite cruel and merciless. Leng Shuangshuang’s eyes flew open from the pain, staring blankly before they shut again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even as a mercenary, Lady Leng Yue had to suck in a cold breath. “Bai Yuqiao, how dare you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yuqiao ignored her and went to sniff the poison needle, then the traces of blood by the wound. “It’s not hard to cure this poison,” she muttered to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon enough, she created an antidote and haphazardly applied it to Leng Shuangshuang’s injury. “Take this medicine with you. No need to sprinkle it on the wound any more, just take it orally three times a day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help her stop the bleeding!” Lady Leng Yue fumed. If not for Bai Yanqing’s sake, she would have killed this damned girl ages ago!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yuqiao took out needle and thread before sewing the wound shut like one would to a set of clothes. Leng Shuangshuang abruptly cried out in pain before the agony sent her spiraling into unconsciousness again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Assassins are this picky too?” Bai Yuqiao scoffed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Leng Yue stared at her coldly until she finished sewing up the wound, then slapped her across the face. “Cheap girl! Do you believe it when I say I’ll take you back to the City of Daughters with me if you get smart with me again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Killer intent flashed past Bai Yuqiao’s eyes as she prepared to retaliate, but Bai Yanqing coughed lightly. With no other choice, she swallowed the bits of blood and broken teeth in her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shuang’er’s poison is cured now?” Lady Leng Yue asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, you suspect this old man’s disciple’s skills?” Bai Yanqing asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Leng Yue didn’t dare. “Thanks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Bai Yanqing gesture for her to board the carriage. She did with Leng Shuangshuang in tow and went to sit in a corner. Bai Yuqiao felt nothing but resentment, but only docilely followed behind her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Bai, Han Yunxi used the same methods as you in the past to break through the matrix pathway. Her poison skills...who taught them to her?” Lady Leng Yue asked with curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yanqing stroked his beard without answering, but he was even more curious to know than she. Despite being friends, she was also his subordinate, so she didn’t dare to press too hard. When Bai Yanqing remained mute, she stopped pursuing the subject. After a while, Bai Yanqing said, “Have you dealt with things on Duanmu Yao’s side?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry. Even if Duanmu Yao was half-dead, she wouldn’t sell us out. We’re all in one boat, after all,” Lady Leng Yue said seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And Grand Concubine Yi?” Bai Yanqing asked next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing to fret over. She won’t every wake again,” Lady Leng Yue smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yanqing was quite pleased. He took Lady Leng Yue’s hand and patted it gently. “Excellent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was originally Tianan Country’s empress dowager that had wanted to kidnap Grand Concubine Yi, but Bai Yanqing told Lady Leng Yue to steal Grand Concubine Yi away and make a deal with Duanmu Yao after finding out the news. This way, Duanmu Yao could extort Long Feiye. Like this, Long Feiye wouldn’t suspect the empress dowager, or that the origins of his birth could be exposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Bai, what did Grand Concubine Yi say?” Lady Leng Yue asked curiously. She only knew of his plans, not the intel he wanted from the woman’s lips. Bai Yanqing had been the only man present that day to interrogate Grand Concubine Yi and the sole witness to her truths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Very quickly, Bai Yanqing released Lady Leng Yue’s hand. “You don’t need to know about that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aye, it’s a shame,” Lady Leng Yue sighed. “Instead of killing Han Yunxi, we lost Duanmu Yao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuqiao, you lost. When we go back, remember to take off a month’s worth of allowance,” Bai Yanqing laughed out loud. He had placed bets with his disciple on whether Lady Leng Yue would be able to kill Han Yunxi before they came here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Bai Yuqiao felt even more aggrieved, but her gloomy face shed no tears. How could a child like her ever cry?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Bai, you didn’t want to kill that lass? She’s quite something. Leaving her alive will only spell peril!” Lady Leng Yue reminded him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s for the future,” Bai Yanqing chuckled. “As for losing Duanmu Yao, hehe, the sword sect elder will find trouble for Long Feiye because of that. Don’t you worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m afraid that girl might find her way to the City of Daughters before the sword sect elder ever gives Long Feiye trouble. Of the 30 some experts in my city...only two to three are left,” Lady Leng Yue grew solemn. If she had killed Long Feiye this time, the City of Daughters would have seen their reputation skyrocket. It was really a pity!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Afraid?” Bai Yanqing smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh, not quite,” Lady Leng Yue was telling the truth. The City of Daughters had strong foundations. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yanqing was pleased. “This old man will send you two back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thrilled, Lady Leng Yue’s gloominess all but evaporated. It would be a lie to say she didn’t admire Bai Yanqing, but the man had always kept his distance from her. As the carriage rolled slowly along, Long Feiye and Han Yunxi had already returned to shore by this time. It had been a deep and distant trip away from Lost Void Lake, filled with plenty of obstacles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re finally safe,” Han Yunxi exhaled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Baili Yuanlong, make arrangements. Three days later, your lordship will set out for a detour to East Jing Prefecture,” Long Feiye said coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Baili Yuanlong was stunned. </span><i><span style>Wasn’t the plan to leave at the end of the month? There are still 10 days left. Why the detour to East Jing? That’s where the City of Daughters is located!</span></i></p>
