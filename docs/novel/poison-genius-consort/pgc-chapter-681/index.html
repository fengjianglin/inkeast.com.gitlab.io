 <p style="text-align: left;">Chapter <span style>681: What does Han Yunxi like?</span><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style>So disappointment followed by surprise was a way to cheer up a girl and touch her heart. </span></i><span style>Long Feiye had never heard of such methods until now. This was also the first time he even bothered to care.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Would this method be effective on Han Yunxi?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi didn’t expect the sudden question and stared at him as her brain short-circuited. For a moment, she didn’t know what to say. Long Feiye slowly drew closer and stared at her with interest as he waited. Despite his patience, he was quite eager to get an answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His familiar scent in close proximity made Han Yunxi subconsciously lean back in hopes of distancing herself. She didn’t mind it when he drew close, but his aura was too powerful. It was difficult for her to breathe when he was nearby. Her heart would speed up too, and an indescribable tension would overtake her body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye didn’t pressure her, but he did lean forward when she leaned back. It had been a while since she’d seen him so up close--especially his eyes. Those deep, dark pupils didn’t have their usual chilly air, but were still fathomless. Although she knew she’d lose herself in them if she stared for too long, she stared at them anyways.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Long Feiye, can I see into your heart if I look into your eyes from here?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Long Feiye, just how many secrets are you hiding in that heart?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Time seemed to freeze as everything grew still. The two of them traded mutual stares, each reflected in the gaze of the other. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suddenly! </span></i><span style>Han Yunxi lost her balance and toppled backwards. Long Feiye immediately caught her around the waist. But instead of pulling her upright, he lowered himself to meet her and said, “And what about you? What do you like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The almost tumble had long startled Han Yunxi back to her senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean, ‘what do I like?’” she asked while feigning ignorance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of flowers do you like?” Long Feiye asked seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to give them to me?” Han Yunxi smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had Long Feiye ever given her flowers? Wouldn’t Jiangnan’s Plum Blossom Sea count? If so, then Long Feiye was unmatched in gifting them. At most, she’d heard of others gifting 999 roses as a romantic gesture, but his entire orchard of plum blossom trees surpassed 999 bouquets. If one was calculating with pure numbers, it’d be impossible to count them all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one needed to teach Long Feiye how to gift things because nobody could match his generosity there. Still, he was unhappy at Han Yunxi’s smile and immediately stopped asking about flowers. Instead he tried, “What </span><i><span style>do </span></i><span style>you like? Hm?” His eyebrows were furrowed as he insisted on an answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I like…” Han Yunxi fell into serious thought. “I like…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She thought it over for a long time before asking, “Long Feiye, will you give me anything I like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” he didn’t think twice before answering. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then listen well,” Han Yunxi grinned mysteriously. Her full weight was lying on his arms, but now she beckoned him to come closer with her finger. She was already bent at near 90 degrees to the floor. If Long Feiye came any nearer, they’d fall over for sure. Thus, he scooped her up and pressed her into his chest before resting his head near her ear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I like…” Han Yunxi was holding out for suspense again. “I like…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm?” Long Feiye had limitless patience when it came to this woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I like Long Feiye. Can you give him to me?” Han Yunxi finally replied. Although this wasn’t her first time confessing, her ears still turned red. Long Feiye gave a start, but she only pinched his chin and laughed. “You have to keep to your word. Don’t go back on your promises, oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye allowed her to toy with his chin as he asked, “Hasn’t your lordship long been yours? When did you lose your lordship to ask for him back again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once upon a time, she’d said she wanted his everything. Now that she was looking into Long Feiye’s warm and gentle gaze, Han Yunxi felt like she was dreaming. She never thought there’d be a day when this man said such gentle and beautiful things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was only joking, but she stopped smiling when she saw him so serious. It might have been her imagination, but she thought she caught a glimpse of sorrow in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sorrow?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She never thought he’d feel sad. His heart was stronger than the edge of his sword, so why would it hurt? Who had pained him? Between them, wasn’t she the only one who felt heartache over the past few years? At most, he’d gotten angry. She straightened up from his embrace and looked at him carefully. She had to make sure she was truly seeing him and not a dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Long Feiye, can you say that one more time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When did you lose your lordship? Now you’re--”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, the line before that! One more time!” she said greedily, boldened by her joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Simpleton,” Long Feiye smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi grew embarrassed as she let him laugh, but he simply held her softly and murmured by her ear, “Han Yunxi, your lordship has long been yours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her cheeks grew flushed and dimpled from her grin. Joy filled her heart even as her ears turned red. His voice was enough to make her melt. </span><i><span style>Long Feiye, no need to coax me or surprise me. As long as a ironhearted man like you shows tenderness, Yunxi’s stone heart will dissolve away too.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“One more time,” she insisted. She was avaricious, after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, your lordship has long been yours. Yours and no one else.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>His hot breaths brushed against her ear, drowning Han Yunxi in happiness. But Long Feiye next commanded, “Han Yunxi, you’re only allowed to have your lordship and no one else.” Then his lips closed on her ears and trailed a line of kisses down her neck, making her tremble as she grew limp and numb in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Long Feiye, so bad…” </span><i><span style>So much for warm and gentle. He’s still domineering!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She pushed him away, but he caught her hands and lingered on her collarbone with his kisses. It seemed to be one of his favorite spots as he dominated her greedily. He didn’t mind her pushing him. In the end, she gave up to the bullying, and he kissed her all the way to the clasps of her collar. Before he could continue, he suddenly drew back. Han Yunxi was calm at first, but grew restless by the end. Finally, she wrapped her arms around his neck and cried, “Long Feiye, that’s enough! Enough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were standing in broad daylight in the Tang Clan’s courtyard. Where could she hide her face if anyone caught them like this?! It was supposed to be Tang Li and Ning Jing’s wedding night. Just who was the conservative and who was the progressive in their relationship?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Long Feiye was still in control of his senses. His lips left a sound kiss on her clavicle before he released her. Still, he persisted in his previous questioning. “Aside from your lordship, what else do you like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not telling you!” Han Yunxi huffed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Li suddenly appeared around the corner. “Sister-in-law, sister-in-law…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scared by his sudden appearance, Han Yunxi jumped. Luckily, Tang Li hadn’t seen anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sister-in-law, Ning Jing’s already--” Tang Li abruptly covered his mouth at the sight of Han Yunxi. He looked between her and Long Feiye with an expression of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it? Ning Jing still hasn’t recovered yet?” Han Yunxi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The poison’s been cured, but she’s still unconscious,” Tang Li mumbled before his gaze trailed back to Han Yunxi’s collarbone again. Of course, when Long Feiye glared at him, he immediately averted his eyes and turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s leaving already? </span></i><span style>Han Yunxi stopped him. “How’s her pulse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The doctor says it’s normal,” Tang Li finally remembered his original motive and asked, “Sister-in-law, when will Ning Jing wake up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it came to work matters, Han Yunxi grew serious. “Demon Night Rampage will cause massive damage to the body when its effects have been compounded--especially injuries to the respiratory tract. Why is her pulse normal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I had the doctor take her pulse five times, but all of them were normal,” Tang Li said hastily.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Five times… </span></i><span style>Han Yunxi shot him a doubtful look. “Was there any need? You were that anxious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, I was just doubting whether the pulse was right!” Tang Li quickly explained. “Sister-in-law, that slut’s just married into the family. If anything happens to her, it’ll be hard to explain things to Cloud Realm Trade Consortium.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She stirred up her own trouble,” Han Yunxi said coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’ll never admit to it. She might even accuse us of poisoning her in the first place!” Tang Li exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi thought that this made sense. “If her pulse is normal, then that means she’s got a good body capable of withstanding the shock.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s so skinny, so how could her body be any good?” Tang Li doubted it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The quality of one’s body doesn’t depend on how fat or skinny you are,” Han Yunxi explained. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If there’s nothing else, then why aren’t you leaving yet?” Long Feiye added. He had no patience to listen to Tang Li and Han Yunxi discuss another woman’s health. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Li was about to leave, but stopped to turn back. “Sister-in-law, in other words, her poison won’t affect her chances for pregnancy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?” Han Yunxi asked. “Her body might be fine, but you can’t just...are you that impatient?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she didn’t like Ning Jing, she couldn’t just let Tang Li bully a girl like that. After all, the girl was still unconscious after her bout with poison. Tang Li was completely innocent, but ended up glancing at Han Yunxi’s collarbone a few more times before adding resentfully, “I...I mean in the future! Afterwards!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Jing’s methods might have been shameless, but he wasn’t inhuman enough to take advantage of her difficult situation. Actually, he was just thinking it’d be easier to keep Ning Jing on Reclining Dragon Range if children were brought into the equation. He hadn’t figured out how to get her pregnant yet, though.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course it won’t affect her in the future. She should recover after resting a couple of days,” Han Yunxi remarked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks a lot, sister-in-law,” Tang Li purposely rubbed at his collar before shooting Han Yunxi a meaningful glance. Then he left. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Sensing something was off, Han Yunxi rubbed at her neck before asking Long Feiye, “Is...did something happen to me here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing. Go back and rest. We should leave by tomorrow.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi stopped asking just as Lady Tang and Tang Zijin arrived on the scene. The latter spotted her chest and averted his gaze, while Lady Tang gave Long Feiye a considering look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t reveal a thing, but asked cheerfully, “Yunxi, that little slut’s fine, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing serious,” Han Yunxi replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then that’s good. Hurry back, we’ve put out a bunch of Feiye’s favorite dishes.” Lady Tang chuckled. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Han Yunxi didn’t return to the banquet hall that night, or else she would have lost all nerve to enter the Tang Clan from there on. As soon as she returned to her rooms and sat down at her dressing table, she discovered that her collarbone was…</span></p>
