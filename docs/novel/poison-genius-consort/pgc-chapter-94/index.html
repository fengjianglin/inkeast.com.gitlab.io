 <p>Chapter&nbsp;94: Forced to answer, Madame Li speaks up&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei’s </span></i><span style>incomparably honorable title brought Han Yunxi no end of restrictions. Han Yunxi understood this from very early on. Lady Xu’s threat was very effective, but it was a pity that it wasn’t new anymore. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, since Lady Xu wanted to play, she didn’t mind playing with her to the end!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She smiled and spoke, “Second Madame, with the Han Family in such chaos, you still have time to worry about my </span><i><span style>mufei’s </span></i><span style>mood. This </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>will definitely pass on your sentiments to </span><i><span style>mufei.”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This words stirred up Lady Xu. What did Han Yunxi mean? It couldn’t be that she wasn’t afraid? Why was she using </span><i><span style>mufei </span></i><span style>this and </span><i><span style>mufei </span></i><span style>that so intimately?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The staid and steady Han Yunxi spoke again. “Since these </span><i><span style>tangshu</span></i><span style>[1] are all so worried about the storehouse key and the Han Family’s successor, Second Madame should tell them the next time they come that my father’s simply in jail. He’s not dead yet. The choice for head of house rests clearly in his heart! There’s no need for those who eat their fill and do nothing else to take the pains to worry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Xu had just used veiled insults against Han Yunxi, but now Han Yunxi was pointing at the mulberry and abusing the locust[2]. How could Lady Xu sit still any longer?! She never thought that Han Yunxi would dare mention Han Congan!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She heard from the Board of Civil Office that Han Yunxi rescued the crown prince and rejected Han Congan’s diagnosis. That was his real reason for incarceration. To put it bluntly, Han Yunxi ruined Han Congan! She even placed restrictions on the Han Family to prevent them from visiting him. It was obvious that she’d stolen the storehouse key and was afraid of being exposed! This damned shameless girl still had the self-assurance to use her father as a talking point. Lady Xu unconsciously clenched her teeth. Since she brought up the topic today, she wouldn’t give up so easily! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei’s </span></i><span style>words have merit, but as this commoner sees it, esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>is still a married daughter. It’ll incur gossip if the Han Family storehouse key remains in your hands.” Here Lady Xu paused before adding, “I trust that the old master left you the key in a moment of desperation so you could pass it on to the Han Family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi didn’t speak, but raised her eyebrows playfully to examine Lady Xu. Their surroundings suddenly grew exceptionally silent as tension rose. Lady Xu was previously self-assured, but began to grow insecure under Han Yunxi’s scrutiny. Finally, she couldn’t take it anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Madame Li, Madame Helian, you two say something too. There’s only us three sisters left in this house, so it’s time for us to work as one! The Han Family can’t fall to decay at our hands!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Helian didn’t even dare to raise her head, much less agree. Madame Li was as taciturn as before, looking as if the business had nothing to do with her as she refilled everyone’s teacups. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, the scene fell into silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And yet right at this moment, a murmur carried in from outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you all discussing the storehouse key? This young master’s is still the Han Family’s eldest son, so shouldn’t you all respect my opinions as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s the key? Hand it over now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>First they heard, then they saw, eldest young master hurriedly running over, one hand on a walking stick while the other held his behind. He hobbled over to stand by the courtyard door, looking coldly at Han Yunxi. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Most likely, he’d just gotten news of Lady Xu’s plans to discuss the storehouse key, or else he would have rushed out of Falling Serenity Residence long ago. Han Yunxi had already stopped minding Han Yuqi’s nasty remarks, but now he’d sent himself over again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Impatiently she spoke, “The storehouse key is with this </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>so what are you muttering about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At these words, Han Yuqi was even more agitated. He took large strides forward but misstepped and tripped to fall flat on his face with a </span><i><span style>bang.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Aiya!” </span></i><span style>he cried out painfully, unable to lift his head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing these, the gathered group was shocked. Little Yi’er was the first to giggle, before Han Yunxi followed in amusement. “Haha! Eldest young master, there’s no feces on the ground, so why are you lying there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Son!” Lady Xu shouted, rushing over. “Son, are you all right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Xu strained to help him up, finally allowing Han Yuqi to raise his head. But his forehead, cheeks and nose were all scraped red by the fall, looking extremely comical. Seeing this, everyone burst out into laughter. Even the timid and meek Seventh Madame couldn’t resist a smile. </span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, Lady Xu had helped Han Yuqi turn over, but as soon as his butt touched the ground, he started hollering. “Hurts...it hurts!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned on his side as if struck by lightning, butt off the ground. Then he pushed Lady Xu aside and grew frighteningly ferocious. “Do you want me to die from the pain?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Xu saw that the pain had twisted his face in agony and couldn’t help but feel distressed and concerned. “Mother didn’t mean it. You’re not injured, right? Does it still hurt? Let’s go back, mother will apply ointment for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Han Yuqi only turned to glare at the gathered people, still fierce. “What are you laughing at, is it very funny?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this, everyone except Han Yunxi stopped laughing, especially Seventh Madame. She shot a glance towards little Yi’er, who could only smooth out his mouth and endure. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s very funny, hahaha! I’m laughing so much that my stomach hurts! Eldest young master, why can’t you bear a little beating? Just a few smacks and you’re hurt this badly?” Han Yunxi grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>You!” </span></i><span style>Han Yuqi was about to be angered to death. He was ready to rush over when Lady Xu held him back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You stop it! Slow down!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With this reminder, Han Yuqi finally calmed down. One hand held his behind while the other pressed against Lady Xu’s hand to stand up. He was naturally tall and strong. Add that to his weighty build, such a gingerly movement made him look all the more hilarious. In the end, Han Yunxi couldn’t stop laughing, her stomach aching from the guffaws. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Yi’er was right next to Han Yunxi. He held it back for as long as he could, but seeing Han Yunxi laugh like that, he couldn’t help but give out a </span><i><span style>snerk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At this, the standing Han Yuqi glared coldly at him. “Han Yunyi, you dare to laugh at this young master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t deal with Han Yunxi, but he could still yell at Han Yunyi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still young but you have the audacity to laugh at your elder brother. Such an uncultured, uncivilized thing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately, little Yi’er grew silent. Seventh Madame’s head was bowed very low, afraid to utter a word. To curse a son for being uncivilized in the presence of his mother was a form of humiliation. Coldness flitted past Han Yunxi’s eyes as she grabbed little Yi’er in an embrace. Smiling frostily, she spoke, “Yi’er, laugh if you want to. He’s an adult but still dares to make impertinent remarks before his seniors, what room does he have to speak of being cultured? Moreover, he can’t even walk straight. I think his mother not only forgot how to teach him proper conduct, but how to walk as well! Really, how hilarious! If it was me, I’d hide away so people wouldn’t laugh. What’s with that muttering?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Han Yunxi spoke, she </span><i><span style>hahaha’d </span></i><span style>three more times, and teased little Yi’er’s face. “Come, laugh a bit for big sister!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With big sister’s protection, little Yi’er wasn’t afraid of anything. He slowly split open his lips and gave a beautiful smile towards Han Yunxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. Smile a bit, see how comfortable that feels!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Xu was so angry that her face turned purple. Han Yuqi had an awkward tongue, so how could he refute those words? Indignant, he started hollering instead. “Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>stop with the nonsense! Give the storehouse key over now! That’s Han Family property, it had nothing to do with a married daughter like you! Hand it over immediately!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he was still here for that key. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was quite composed as she raised her chin. “I didn’t bring it!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You!” </span></i><span style>Han Yuqi’s hands clenched into fists, gnashing his teeth. “Slut, you’re looking for a beating!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Xu wanted to make her move long ago, but she gained calm after countless trials and tribulations. She pressed against Han Yuqi’s hand and spoke in a low voice. “Haven’t you lost enough the last time? Why be so impulsive? See how your old mother settles things with her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the reminder of his 50 planks, Han Yuqi felt a lingering fear. He grit his teeth and endured for the moment! In any case, he’ll wait to get the key first before taking care of Han Yunxi. She doted on Han Yunyi, didn’t she? When the time came, he’d definitely </span><i><span style>‘serve’ </span></i><span style>that stupid brat well!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Xu took a deep breath and supported her son by the arm as she walked over. Han Yuqi couldn’t sit down, so he only stood on one side. Seeing this, Madame Li spoke up. “Someone, hurry and assist the eldest young master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two little pageboys ran over and stood on each side of Han Yuqi to support him. Only now did Lady Xu feel relieved enough to sit down herself. She still remembered her question from before!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>I trust that the old master left you the key in a moment of desperation so you could pass it on to the Han Family?” Lady Xu asked again. Today she had to force Han Yunxi to answer this question, no matter what.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Han Yunxi remained silent. The storehouse key had thoroughly ensnared Han Yuqi like some sort of spell. Seeing Han Yunxi’s reticence, he immediately called her out. “Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>why don’t you answer? You’re not afraid of being found out, are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet still, Han Yunxi remained quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this, Han Yuqi was even more convinced that Han Yunxi had snatched the key from her father’s hands. He was about to launch an attack when the taciturn Madame Li finally spoke up. “I think that old master must have left some instructions with the storehouse key in Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei’s </span></i><span style>hands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold satisfaction flitted past Han Yunxi’s eyes. She had stayed silent just to wait for Third Madame to speak! If Lady Xu’s words could be considered formidable before, Madame Li’s words revealed her as the true expert in speech. Her words were clearly made to sound Han Yunxi out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If Han Congan took the initiative to give her the storehouse key, then he must have told her to who give it to. At this point, she should tell them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If she stole the storehouse key from Han Congan’s hands, she’d be hard-pressed to answer the question now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Li truly was intelligent. As a general rule, if Han Congan gave the key to Han Yunxi, he would’ve told her to give it to which house of the Han Family. It was a pity that Madame Li had overestimated the situation of the Han house and underestimated Han Congan. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Congan might have been muddleheaded over Lady Tianxin’s affairs, but he was shrewd enough in other matters. He was very clear on the disgusting tendencies of the other young masters and the thoughts of his various concubines. He had no favorites in his heart because he placed the Han Family first and foremost. Even if he accounted for Han Yunyi, he never said Han Yunyi had to be head of house. That decision he left to Han Yunxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to the Board of Civil Office’s influence behind Lady Xu, he much preferred to trust Han Yunxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Madame Li’s words, Lady Xu rejoiced in her heart and hurried to add, “That’s right. Old master must have given you instructions. Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>look at these times. Everyone’s here today, so just speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi had a cold smile in her heart. She was planning to finish investigating the affair of the young general and the enemy agent before dealing with Han Family matters. But since Lady Xu was so anxious today, and Madame Li so impatient, she might as well reveal her hand early.</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Han Yunxi:&nbsp;</strong>You know, you can fix a lot of problems just by using some common sense.</p>
 <p><strong>Madame Li:</strong> That's a rare commodity in some webnovels.</p>
 <p><strong>Han Yunxi:&nbsp;</strong>That's a rare commodity in some webnovel&nbsp;<em>families.</em></p>
 <p><strong>Lady Xu:</strong>&nbsp;Esteemed <em>wangfei</em>, don't be so quick to bite the hand that fed you.</p>
 <p><strong>Han Yunxi:</strong> Don't be so quick to attack the girl who PWN'd you last time, either!</p>
 <p><strong>Lady Xu:</strong> <em>Why you-- *scene fades to black*</em></p>
 <p></p>

 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Madame Li:</strong>&nbsp;We interrupt this teaser to bring you a fresh cup of tea.</p>

 <p><strong>Madame Li:</strong> The history of tea dates back as early as the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046BC), where it was brewed&nbsp;for medicinal purposes. Nowadays, a wide variety of tea exists in both East and West.</p>

 <p><strong>Madame Li:</strong> It can be served alone or with a fine selection of delicate snacks for the ultimate elegant experience.
