 <p style="text-align: left;">Chapter <span style>695: The perfect match, Ye-Xi (1)</span><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye hadn’t even asked where Grand Concubine Yi was before the younger woman gave it away. Her threat seemed full of confidence. Unfortunately, Long Feiye simply treated her like air: completely invisible. Even Lady Leng Yue felt ashamed for the young woman’s sake. She chuckled and said, “I certainly can. However, will your lordship’s price be offering a higher price than this woman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How does the entire City of Daughters sound?” Long Feiye said as if offering a reward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Leng Yue grew incensed. “Long Feiye, what do you mean by this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill her and hand over Grand Concubine Yi and your lordship will consider sparing the City of Daughters. Otherwise...shoulder the consequences!” Long Feiye threatened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone who dared to invade his estate and steal away Grand Concubine Yi would make him a laughingstock once news of it spread. How many more would think of targeting the Duke of Qin’s estate then? After all, the </span><i><span style>jianghu </span></i><span style>was a land of crouching tigers and hidden dragons. There were too many unseen dangers at prowl. He had to make the City of Daughters pay as a way to warn any idiots in the martial arts circles. Although he hadn’t gone to Celestial Mountain yet, he didn’t mind destroying the City of Daughters first. Cloud Realm Continent’s </span><i><span style>jianghu </span></i><span style>could be sent into an uproar first for all he cared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Leng Yue sucked in a cold breath. “Long Feiye, don’t be so supercilious. Today, your ladyship will teach you a lesson in minding your words!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she drew her sword, the young woman suddenly stopped her with a murmur. “Did you forget what you promised me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Leng Yue really had forgotten after Long Feiye enraged her. “Don’t worry. Your ladyship is merely teaching him a lesson. He’ll have a better sense of propriety then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the young woman only clutched onto her hand and muttered, “Lady Leng Yue, want to try and betray our contract? Do you believe that I’ll blurt out the truth? Would you want to ruin the City of Daughters’ reputation?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What was the truth?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That it wasn’t the young woman who hired Lady Leng Yue at all, but that Lady Leng Yue had kidnapped Grand Concubine Yi first, then made a deal with her. The City of Daughters dealt in assassinations, but they only accepted offers before moving to act. They would always wait for the customer to approach them first, not the other way around. If news of this “deal” got out, then the City of Daughters would lose their reputation utterly. All of the </span><i><span style>jianghu </span></i><span style>would disdain them--especially Carefree City, who’d see them as a laughingstock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally regaining her senses, Lady Leng Yue turned to Long Feiye with a cold tone. “Doing business with your ladyship is acceptable, but finish up this deal first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So speaking, she moved to stand behind the younger woman. Finally in the spotlight again, the young woman asked coldly, “Long Feiye, we had a deal. You would come by yourself with the Profound Frost Sword in exchange for the hostage. What do you mean by this? Don’t you want to see Grand Concubine Yi anymore?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye finally deigned to look at the woman, his pupils brimming with...</span><i><span style>disgust! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How do you know that your lordship isn’t holding the Profound Frost Sword right now?” he retorted. Although it was true he hadn’t brought the weapon, this sword looked very similar to the real thing. Only someone familiar with the original would be able to tell the difference.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Profound Frost Blade was a sacred treasure of Celestial Mountain. How many people in the world could identify it at a glance? Han Yunxi narrowed her eyes. She finally knew who the other woman was! How...</span><i><span style>nauseating!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye raised his sword and struck towards the woman’s face, aiming to unveil her. But she unsheathed her sword in turn with Lady Leng Yue rising to support her. Both of them faced off against Long Feiye, who was still shielding Han Yunxi with one hard. He was stuck at an disadvantage. Meanwhile, the younger woman seemed to be injured, but her sword skills were still formidable. Lady Leng Yue was an even harder opponent capable of fighting on par with Long Feiye himself! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon enough, the two woman split up to attack him from both sides. Long Feiye remained on the defensive, dividing his attention equally between Han Yunxi and deflecting the blows. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“So His Highness Duke of Qin was a licentious player, too.” Lady Leng Yue mocked as she made a surprise attack. Long Feiye blocked her with his sword, and she immediately moved to expand her energy to suppress him. Her goals were clear: trap Long Feiye in place so the younger woman could seize a chance to kill Han Yunxi. It had to be said that she succeeded, because Long Feiye was stuck fast. He carried Han Yunxi in one hand while wielding his sword with the other, making it impossible for him to repel her all at once. Aside from Cang Qiuzi, Lady Leng Yue was the strongest foe he’d met in the martial arts circles yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, the younger woman rejoiced. She had been waiting for this chance for ages. Her sword went stabbing straight at Han Yunxi. Of course, she held a trace of caution despite her excitement; she’d suffered once at Han Yunxi’s hands already. Now she kept her eyes on the woman’s mouth, hands, and feet in case poison needles came flying her way. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, she could’ve dodged the the last time they faced off, but she hadn’t been expecting a surprise attack and was caught off-guard. There would have been no serious injuries if she was paying attention. As expected, Han Yunxi spat out a poison needle while launching more from her hand. The young woman dodged them all with a mocking laugh. “Han Yunxi, paltry tricks like yours aren’t even worth a vaudeville show! Lame!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi simply narrowed her eyes in silence and kept launching toxic needles. Meanwhile, the woman kept evading them one by one. Suddenly, she deflected all the needles with her blade and aimed its tip at Han Yunxi’s heart. At the same time, Long Feiye let go of his sword and turned with Han Yunxi in his arms to avoid the woman’s blade. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody expected him to throw his weapon away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Because they dodged so suddenly, the young woman had no time to withdraw her momentum. Lady Leng Yue was in the same predicament. In the end, both of them ended up stabbing each other. Because Lady Leng Yue had put her entire strength behind her stab, withdrawing it so suddenly would only harm herself. She could only try to change the direction of her attack while keep moving forwards. Meanwhile, the younger woman managed to stop her attack...but it was at the same time Lady Leng Yue’s sword came aiming for her stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything happened in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Move it!” </span></i><span style>Lady Leng Yue didn’t even have time to shout a warning. Fresh blood spread from the younger woman’s stomach like scarlet vines, staining her spotless white dress with flecks of bewitching crimson like flower petals. She touched her stomach with a face full of fear before staring dazedly at Lady Leng Yue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t hit any vital points, so you won’t die!” Although it had been an accident, Lady Leng Yue was very clear on how her sword had moved. She shifted to shield the younger woman behind her before flashing sideways to avoid the lash of Long Feiye’s whip. Glancing at the discarded sword on the ground, she could only hiss at him. “Despicable!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As it turned out, Long Feiye’s true motive was to use his whip, not his sword. No wonder he’d abandon the blade so easily. The younger woman had recovered now as well. A deep wound had pierced her stomach, which was now bleeding uncontrollably. While Lady Leng Yue shielded her, she tore her sleeves into shreds to make a makeshift bandage to stop the blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Call out the others. They can definitely contain Long Feiye,” the young woman muttered. She wouldn’t swallow this without killing off Han Yunxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Move to the side. Today, your ladyship wants to see just how capable Long Feiye is!” Lady Leng Yue was now thoroughly infuriated. She refused to believe that he could match her while protecting Han Yunxi at the same time. She wasn’t the city lord of the City of Daughters for nothing! Just then, he’d simply seized an advantage in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young woman knew she’d be nothing more than a burden to Lady Leng Yue in her current state. A complicated look flickered past her eyes before she conceded. “Don’t injure him fatally. Just make it impossible for him to look after Han Yunxi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew Lady Leng Yue might mortally wound Long Feiye if she turned serious. If Long Feiye gave up Han Yunxi, he could fight freely against the woman, but he only risked injury otherwise. Hatred had long filled her heart at the sight of him protecting the girl. </span><i><span style>He might as well get hurt, too. </span></i><span style>Thus, she withdrew to the side so Lady Leng Yue could fight at full peak!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately, Lady Leng Yue unsheathed a second sword from within her blade, making her doubly armed as she charged towards the couple. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Double Swords Harmony. I’ve finally witnessed it with my own eyes,” Long Feiye said coldly. It was a skill that could only be accomplished with two separate people, yet Lady Leng Yue had managed it just on her own. This was her original creation, a technique that Long Feiye had only heard of from the sword sect master. Even that elder greatly admired its prowess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi grew doubtful as she stared at the twin blades. </span><i><span style>Just how are they made, to combine as one without falling apart?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye and Lady Leng Yue were already fighting while she lost herself in thought in his arms to study the play of both swords. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You haven’t even tasted their power yet. How could you say you’ve witnessed anything?” Lady Leng Yue laughed out loud. As she charged with both blades, Long Feiye retreated with a vicious lash of his whip. She simply threw her sword into the air, where it avoided his whip to flip in mid air, bounce off a nearby branch, and come flying with renewed momentum at Long Feiye and Han Yunxi’s backs. At the same time, she was pressing forward with her other sword in her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hemmed in from both ends, Long Feiye was forced to twist his body to dodge. The motion made him swing the whip aside, giving Lady Leng Yue ample time to close in. At the same time, something miraculous happened: the sword she’d launched in mid-air changed directions to aim for Long Feiye’s back again! After a few rounds of this, Lady Leng Yue was gradually gaining the upper hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi,” Long Feiye muttered in a low voice, “Use poison.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They’d agreed beforehand to work together here. He would protect her while she fought the enemies. Now was the perfect time to start her offensive. He was more than enough to hold off Lady Leng Yue by himself, but it was a challenge when he had to protect her too. Moreover, other killers were lying in ambush just around them, so he couldn’t concern himself with Lady Leng Yue alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye’s judgment was sound, but Han Yunxi rejected the idea. “It’s still early. I have a way to break through her Double Swords Harmony.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, she took out a fist-sized magnetite from the depths of her medical pouch!</span><i></i></p>
