 <p>Chapter 14: No confidence at heart&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volaretranslations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bloodstained handkerchief was with the Duke of Qin? The old </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath as she looked towards him in disbelief. </span></p>
 <p><span style>What kind of joke was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody knew when the Duke of Qin had returned last night. It was already inconceivable that he hadn’t chased this woman out of the Hibiscus Courtyard. To walk together with her like this, she guessed he was there to pay respects to his elders. How could he and this woman do </span><i><span style>this </span></i><span style>and </span><i><span style>that</span></i><span style>...and bring the bloodstained handkerchief with him? This woman had to be lying, but how did she dare in front of the Duke of Qin? Was she looking to die? The old </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>thoughts were all in a knot. She wanted to ask but dared not speak, only waited for the Duke of Qin’s reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye only threw them a '</span><i><span style>Wait,'</span></i><span style> before walking back by himself. </span></p>
 <p><em><span style>To get the evidence?</span></em></p>
 <p><span style>The old </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>couldn’t help but cover her mouth and steal a glance at Murong Wanru, who was spying on them from a distance. Han Yunxi curiously followed her gaze but saw nobody there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...the two of you…” the old </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was extremely shaken. The way she was acting, it was as if she was watching an adulterous couple instead! Han Yunxi rolled her eyes before leaning against a bamboo fence to wait. Actually, she wasn’t confident either. Heaven only knows if Long Feiye would really bring back a cloth with blood on it. Last night she only made sure he’d accompany her to pay respects, but forgot all about this thorn. If there wasn’t a drop of blood on the handkerchief, then him coming with her would still be pointless. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Only something like that could prove he accepted her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she knew something like that was impossible, it was hard to accept that truth. Han Yunxi still held onto that tiny bit of hope since she’d already married him. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Long Feiye, we were married because of the emperor’s orders, not because I insisted. If you can’t defy the emperor, could you not put all the pressure on my shoulders, please?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi lowered her eyes, falling into silence as she leaned against the fence. The old </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was burning with impatience as she paced in place, shooting glances at her every few seconds as if she was some strange creature. Finally, Long Feiye returned, but his hands were empty. Did he bring nothing because he decided to tell the truth? Han Yunxi did her best to ignore the misery in her heart and smiled without asking any questions. The old </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>wasn’t so patient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your highness....where is the handkerchief?” she asked him nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll bring it inside,” Long Feiye replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was greatly shocked. “Your highness...your highness is going to see the grand imperial concubine, with her, together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye didn’t answer her. Neither did he pay any attention to Han Yunxi, but started walking as soon as he finished speaking. His legs were long, so he walked very quickly, and Han Yunxi hurried to catch up before her brain could process what had happened. Her heart started to pound as she wondered exactly how he was going to deal with this. She wanted to ask, but didn’t know how, and followed him all the way to Grand Concubine Yi’s front doors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before them stood a girl of seventeen to eighteen years, as slender as a thread. It seemed that a simple gust of wind would knock her over. She was dressed rather simply, with a fresh and pure look and an exceptionally gentle warmth in her eyes. This girl was none other than Grand Concubine Yi’s adopted daughter, Murong Wanru. As soon as she saw them arrive, she hurried forward and called out shyly. “Elder brother, you’ve come too?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Wanru’s voice was soft&nbsp;and demure, enough to melt a person’s heart. Han Yunxi couldn’t help but grow goosebumps and sigh inwardly. </span><i><span style>What a big show for a ‘delicate and fragile’ flower! </span></i><span style>Tender and temperate, she was the type of beauty to attract attention wherever you looked. A shame that Long Feiye treated her as air and walked right past. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So it seems like this guy is just cold to everyone he meets.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder brother…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Wanru’s voice was warm enough to melt one’s bones, but filled with hurt at having been wronged. Han Yunxi shivered again, trying to shake off another round of goosebumps. She didn’t expect the girl to come over and attempt to measure her up, eyes filled with jealousy even as she smiled and spoke with a kindly tone. “Sister-in-law, you’re very beautiful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she finished speaking, she affectionately took Han Yunxi’s hands to comfort her. “My brother’s just has this kind of personality, don’t mind him. Come, I’ll bring you inside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t it Long Feiye who treated Murong Wanru like air just then? She was talking like she was the mistress and Han Yunxi was but a guest of the house. No matter how good this adopted daughter was, her surname still wasn’t </span><i><span style>Long. </span></i><span style>And no matter how unfavored she, herself, was as wife, she was still going to be mistress of the house in the future. Han Yunxi put on a false smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Many thanks, Miss Murong, but I can go by myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having spoken, she pushed aside the offered hand and stepped inside.</span></p>
