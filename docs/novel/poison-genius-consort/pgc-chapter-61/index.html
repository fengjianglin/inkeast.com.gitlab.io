 <p>Chapter 61: Competition between women&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With those thoughts, Han Yunxi felt much more comfortable. She quietly retreated to one side of the room and sat down, prepared to watch the proceedings. </span><i><span style>Your Highness Duke of Qin, chenqie will be awaiting your outstanding performance!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pill Fiend had already given his orders, allowing Dunamu Baiye to give a derisive smirk. “Your Highness Duke of Qin, it’s just a chance to learn from one another. Don’t get too serious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He finished speaking to draw to one side as the room turned quiet. Everyone’s eyes rested on Long Feiye, both nervous and anticipatory. Long Feiye’s first action caught people off guard. His cold gaze rested on Duanmu Yao’s hand with an expression that showed his determination to win. Suddenly, his figure flashed and appeared by Duanmu Yao’s side.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This guy, he was really going to steal it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was shocked, but quickly recovered her senses. She really wanted to shout and cheer him on. Although she knew Long Feiye was just doing this to get the Life Blood Pill, it still made her happy. </span><i><span style>Who cared about what senior brother, junior sister business they had.</span></i><span style> She decided to forgive him for what had happened in Snake Gorge. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Neither Duanmu Baiye or Duanmu Yao had expected this turn of events. Duanmu Yao backed away in a flash, the corners of her eyes turning red. Senior Brother had never paid her any attention in the past, but that was only because his nature was cold. In all these years, he’d never tried to steal her things! Yet today he was willing to steal for Han Yunxi. To steal her item and give it to Han Yunxi!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao couldn’t accept this reality. She gave Han Yunxi a hateful glare, wishing she could go over and tear that woman apart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Baiye’s voice was furious. “Long Feiye, are you really stealing a woman’s things?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The thing doesn’t belong to her!” Long Feiye retorted aggressively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Baiye was left awkward and speechless while Duanmu Yao was stifled with rage as she glanced at Long Feiye. She hid the Seven Stars Caterpillar Grass in her robes, immediately sticking out her chest as she sucked in her stomach. “Senior Brother, it’s rare for us to have a chance to cross swords. If you want to steal it, then come!” she said fearlessly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly the room grew quiet before Pill Fiend gave a hearty laugh. The sound was both dark and strange, sounding ancient in one moment and clear and bright the next. It flooded the entire room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good! Good! An excellent idea, hahahah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi watched as her mouth kept twitching. </span><i><span style>Duanmu Yao, you’re plenty fierce. Do you still want to leave yourself any face?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A man’s base tactics couldn’t compare to a woman’s! Long Feiye’s face darkened, his eyes filled with loathing as both parties came to a deadlock. In the wake of His Excellency Pill Fiend’s laughter, the room grew silent again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sitting above them all, Pill Fiend was extremely happy. It had been a long, long time since Pill Fiend Valley had turned so lively. His eyes swept over the assembled crowd before finally resting on Han Yunxi and narrowing in thought. Everyone was standing in a deadlock, but this woman was interesting. She’d decided to sit and watch, much like him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Pill Fiend opened his mouth and spoke in a leisurely tone, “Your Highness Duke of Qin, it’s more fitting for a woman to steal from a woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words were undoubtedly targeting Han Yunxi, who looked at Pill Fiend with wide eyes. </span><i><span style>What did this old guy want to do?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Baiye and Duanmu Yao both looked at Han Yunxi, only now realizing that she was sitting leisurely on one side. Seeing her so carefree made Duanmu Yao even more angry. </span><i><span style>Who did she think she was?!</span></i><span style> Duanmu Yao had long witnessed how much of a useless coward Han Yunxi was in Snake Gorge. She didn’t want to fight with Senior Brother in the first place, so now Pill Fiend had offered up a good idea. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With a smirk, Duanmu Yao spoke. “Han Yunxi, if it’s something you want, steal it yourself. This princess will yield three moves to you.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words had hardly landed before Long Feiye said mildly, “Your Excellency Pill Fiend, she doesn’t know martial arts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doesn’t know martial arts?” Pill Fiend was a bit skeptical. How could a woman be so calm and free to sit around if she didn’t know how to fight?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao had no idea why Long Feiye really wanted the Life Blood Pill. Seeing how protective he was, her two eyes seemed to ooze with poisonous intent. “If she’s incapable, then she shouldn’t make a disgrace of herself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was pretty satisfied with Long Feiye’s actions. At the very least, they stood on the same side. Seeing Duanmu Yao running rampant, she didn’t lose her cool but slowly rose, feigning a miserable countenance. “Your Excellency Pill Fiend, how crude it is for women to come to blows! Furthermore, I don’t know martial arts, so why don’t we compete with something else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pill Fiend didn’t get a chance to answer before Duanmu Yao butted in. “Han Yunxi, what do you mean? Who are you calling crude?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course it’s whoever’s taking offense,” Han Yunxi said carelessly. Duanmu Yao was about to erupt but Han Yunxi kept talking. “The stately Western Zhou princess whose name is known throughout her country is accomplished in the arts, martial prowess, and appearances. Her self-cultivation and accomplishments must be excellent, so how could she be crude?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second half of those words left Duanmu Yao with no words to say. No matter how angry she was, she could only choke it back into her heart. Duanmu Yao’s eyes narrowed; despite her rage, a flicker of admiration passed through her pupils. This woman didn’t know martial arts but was more formidable than one who did! Long Feiye’s lips quirked up, while Pill Fiend burst into laughter, thoroughly enjoying this bout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unable to vent her temper, Duanmu Yao could only take a few deep breaths before she calmed herself down. “All right, Han Yunxi. This princess agrees. Whatever we compete in, you can choose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was right. She was one of Cloud Realm Continent’s famous talented woman, gifted in the arts, martial prowess, and appearances. Weak woman only competed in things like </span><i><span style>qin </span></i><span style>playing, chess, calligraphy and so on. She’d won all these things since she was young, so how could a small fry like Han Yunxi, unfavored wife that she was, win in comparison? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi frowned slightly. “To make things fair, we should have His Excellency Pill Fiend decide on the competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally, Pill Fiend agreed. No matter who won or lost, he’d still get two treasures, and watching women struggle was much better than watching men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Excellent, that’s how it’ll be!” he gave another weird laugh in excitement. “Your excellency will decide the topic. You’ll compete in…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stopped here. </span><i><span style>What to compete?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pill Fiend fell silent. After getting used to that strange laugh, Han Yunxi felt that this silence was much more frightening. Though she was far away from him, she could still feel a terrifying and mysterious aura emanating from his being. Heaven knows what kind of freakish, horrific topic he’d choose? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao raised her chin to gaze provokingly at Han Yunxi, determined to win. She was in an aggressive mood. No matter what the topic was, she had to showcase herself before Senior Brother today and thoroughly humiliate this ‘Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Though Han Yunxi had no confidence, competing in anything was better than sparring. Her strength was much less than Duanmu Yao’s. She didn’t lose her disposition and raised an eyebrow to stare back. So what if she was a princess? She could sort out the princess of her own country, much less one from a bordering nation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, Pill Fiend slowly raised his head. “Your excellency’s thought it through!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately, everyone looked over to see him in a great mood, laughing eerily. “Hunting for medicinal ingredients! The two of you can compete in plant hunting!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hunting for medicinal ingredients?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of medicine? How do we hunt for them?” Duanmu Yao was doubtful. This was beyond her expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your excellency will provide a prescription and a book of pictures of medicinal plants. You two can search the entire Pill Fiend Valley for the plants. Whoever gathers up all of them first wins.” Pill Fiend said smugly, very satisfied with his idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao did some mental calculations. She didn’t understand anything about medicine, but what about Han Yunxi? </span></p>
 <p><span style>This woman was the useless trash of the Han family, though news of her becoming a divine doctor had drifted out from Tianning’s capital. Duanmu Yao still didn’t believe it, thinking that Han Yunxi had spread the rumors herself. Otherwise, why would she refuse to treat all the people who’d gathered at her house? </span></p>
 <p><span style>So Han Yunxi should be just like her, ignorant of any and all medicinal plants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If that was the case, she’d be in the superior position. Pill Fiend Valley was so big that it’d take massive effort to search through the whole place for plants. A glance at Han Yunxi’s frail body convinced her that the woman couldn’t take the strain. Even if she could, her speed would pale in comparison!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Here Duanmu Yao immediately spoke up in a flattering tone. “His Excellency Pill Fiend truly is venerable. Even the topics he picks are different from everyone else. Though, I don’t know if anyone else can help us search for the plants?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since it’s a competition between the two of you, outside help is naturally forbidden,” Pill Fiend replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words gave Duanmu Yao even more confidence. Without Long Feiye’s help, how far could Han Yunxi walk on those pair of legs? And how quickly? She could easily fly a distance that would take Han Yunxi half a day to walk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Excellency Pill Fiend, I agree to this competition!” Duanmu Yao was delighted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pill Fiend was very satisfied and looked towards Han Yunxi. “Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>what about you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a bit difficult…” Han Yunxi admitted with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You could admit defeat now,” Duanmu Yao sneered immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Han Yunxi only said earnestly, “Although it’s a little hard, I was still born from a medical family. To compete in hunting for medicinal plants, wouldn’t Princess Changle think it’s unfair?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao gave a mocking laugh and said under her breath, “I hear you’re the first useless trash in Han family history, how pitiful! It’s no harm if this princess yields to you a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In other words, Princess Changle thinks this competition is very fair?” Han Yunxi asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Baiye felt that something wasn’t right and wanted to speak, but Duanmu Yao had ulterior motives. Afraid that Han Yunxi would try to change the topic, she impatiently said, “Very fair. If you agree, then we’ll start right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi looked completely helpless as she nodded her head. “All right.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>All right...if someone wanted to invite a snub, what could she do? </span></i><span style>Han Yunxi wouldn’t tell Duanmu Yao that she spent part of her studies in traditional Chinese medicine training to hunt for plants in the mountains! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The growth, habits, and properties of medicinal plants were all different. They grew in different places, and while some plants grew in clusters, other would never grow together. As long as one was familiar with the characteristics of these plants and rules of their growth, you could give her an entire valley--nay, an entire mountain--and she’d still find the ingredients quickly! She depended on such skills to earn her meals, so why wouldn’t she know her strengths?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Han Yunxi agree made Duanmu Yao smile. She couldn’t wait to see Han Yunxi lose the Life Blood Pill for Long Feiye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very good, then don’t regret what you’ve agreed to. If you do, your excellency will be very unhappy!” Pill Fiend’s laughter sounded like he was joking, but it was also a warning. Only then did he lazily rise to his feet and walk gracefully to a table to write out a prescription.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>With so many plants in Pill Fiend Valley, what kind of prescription would he choose?</span></p>
