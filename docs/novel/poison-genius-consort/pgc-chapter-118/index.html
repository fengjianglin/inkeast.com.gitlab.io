 <p><span style>Chapter 118: Unforeseen, the master appears</span>&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingwu and Guard Shangguan chased Long Feiye to the cliff, where they immediately saw the dense black mass gathering by the northern forests like a dark cloud.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The two men were like monks who couldn’t touch their heads as they saw His Highness Duke of Qin’s figure rushing off into the distance. Both of them hesitated: should they give chase? But just as they were wavering, an oval-shaped mass in the north suddenly shifted and lengthened into a long strip that headed towards the north.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What was the matter?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Was it possible for the poison miasma to change shape? Even if the wind was to blame, it should change so quickly and uniformly. Not to mention, the wind was blowing </span><i><span style>from </span></i><span style>the north.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Strange...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Young General, this...is this really poison miasma?” Guard Shangguan couldn’t help but think that something was off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingwu’s eyes were fixated on the black mass until he saw it start to flow and circulate. From a distance, it resembled a black ribbon drifting towards the north as it increased in speed! Even an idiot would be able to tell this wasn’t miasma!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chase it!” Mu Qingwu said as he leaped down to follow. Guard Shangguan didn’t think much before going after him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By this time, Long Feiye had already closed the distance between him and the swarm of mosquitos. He landed on a nearby tree and watched clearly as the mosquitoes seemed to fight over something in the air, struggling while they fought against each other to fly forwards.</span><i><span style> If he went in the same direction, would he catch up to Han Yunxi?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye didn’t rush to the front of the swarm, but remained behind it. He knew that he wouldn’t lose his way if he followed them, because mosquitoes had a much sharper sense of smell than humans. And since the swarm didn’t move very fast, it was easy to keep pace. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>About one </span><i><span style>li</span></i><span style>[1] away from the swarm was Qingyi and Han Yunxi, traveling along at high speeds. There were somewhat far ahead, but the mosquito swarms were so silent that it remained unnoticed behind them. First and foremost, Qingyi had to successfully escape while guaranteeing their safety. Secondly, Master said to bring this woman to their hidden headquarters in Tianning. As long as she could complete her tasks, she’d be able to go back. She too, was a hidden agent with a sensitive identity. Her responsibilities were heavy, so it’d be suspicious if she went missing for too long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qingyi was traveling at unprecedented speeds, but close behind her was a red shadow that streaked through the underbrush like an arrow in close pursuit. It wasn’t clear how long they ran before the red shadow suddenly ground to a stop to hide behind a large tree trunk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who else could this be but Gu Qishao?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only stood after seeing Qingyi’s group some distance away, lifting his head to sniff at the air. Then he spread out his palm and raised it against the wind for a few moments. When he withdrew his hand, it was to sniff his palm. Surprise came first, followed by laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Poison lass...you’ve got good skills!” Those long, narrow eyes were beautiful when he smiled. Glancing back, he playfully licked his lips before turning to renew the chase. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mosquito swarm and Qingyi’s group were already two mountains apart. As the mosquitoes gave chase, they fought in the air for the powder, so their speed wasn’t very great. Add that to Qingyi’s own fast pace and the mosquitoes chased all the way until early morning the next day without finding the source of the powder: Han Yunxi’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, Long Feiye’s group was still one mountain behind after Mu Qingwu and Guard Shangguan had caught up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness, what’s going on?” Mu Qingwu asked intently. He had his own guesses, but wasn’t certain. Once Long Feiye clarified the situation, both Mu Qingwu and Guard Shangguan were astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In other words, the assassins are just up ahead. Your Highness, why not give chase?” Guard Shangguan was very excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your lordship’s very curious to see where they’re taking Han Yunxi.” Long Feiye was full of interest and not worried at all. If he wanted to give chase, wouldn’t he have long saved Han Yunxi by now? He didn’t because he was setting out a line to hook a bigger fish. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingwu and Guard Shangguan immediately understood his words, but Guard Shangguan grew puzzled soon afterwards. If His Highness Duke of Qin really worried about esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>his first reaction should be to save her, right? But today he was treating esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>as bait so he could storm the thieves’ lair. If things didn’t go right, they might kill the hostage! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at His Highness Duke of Qin’s frigid expression, Guard Shangguan was more convinced than ever than Mu Qingwu’s words from yesterday had been wrong. Sacrificing a single Han Yunxi to expose a den of traitors was killing two golden eagles with one arrow for His Highness Duke of Qin, getting him the best of both worlds. If Han Yunxi was killed, the Duke of Qin’s residence would still shine bright. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he’d already spoken, neither Mu Qingwu or Guard Shangguan dared to urge him otherwise. They could only follow closely behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qingyi’s group was in the lead, with Gu Qishao behind them and the mosquito swarm behind him. Long Feiye’s group was at the very end. This chase was like a mantis stalking the cicada while being unaware of the oriole behind[2]. Just who would be the oriole by the end?</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time trickled by. A few days had already passed, and as the distance closed between the groups, the concentration of Mosquito Incense grew thicker and thicker, gradually slowing the progress of the swarm. Early this morning, Han Yunxi had stopped releasing the powder. So many days had passed with Qingyi maintaining her silence, but Han Yunxi could sense that they were close to their destination. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She’d created such a huge swarm of mosquitoes behind her for the past few days, but had no one discovered any peculiarities in the forests yet? Unless everyone had scattered after the mosquito swarm spread, so all the men in the mountains had retreated without leaving one behind? In this way, nobody discovered the newly formed mosquito swarm? Even if Mu Qingwu and Guard Shangguan overlooked the detail, Long Feiye wasn’t the type to give up so easily. He should know that she’d have a way to use the poison mosquito swarms!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if he didn’t remember, with his personality, he wouldn’t back off just from a single obstacle, right? Or did he really not come? But even so, if he really didn’t come, Mu Qingwu and Guard Shangguan would’ve sent men to search the mountains again after the swarms scattered! Judging by the time, someone should’ve discovered the new swarm of mosquitos. Why wasn’t there any reaction after so many days?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unless...Mu Qingwu and the rest had given up the search?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The kidnapping of Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>was a big deal, so who could stop Mu Qingwu and Guard Shangguan from searching? Only Long Feiye. If he didn’t come himself and stopped caring, did it mean he was seizing the opportunity to let her die? Thinking up to here, Han Yunxi’s lively pupils gradually turned dark. She stared blankly for a while before the corners of her lips tugged into a mocking smile.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why would Long Feiye come? Why would he save her?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The weather was so cold that he was probably spending his time in a hothouse by the fire, patiently waiting for these kidnappers to come knocking on his door. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Or maybe he’d allow them to kill the hostage without feeling threatened by them at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The empress dowager bestowed their marriage, the emperor forced them to marry. If there wasn’t sufficient reason, he couldn’t divorce her. Even if she died, the Duke of Qin’s residence would still have to provide an adequate reason to convince everyone else.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wasn’t this the perfect chance?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Right at this moment, Qingyi suddenly landed on the ground. Han Yunxi’s feet hit the dirt hard, causing her ailing right foot to send a wave of pain that stretched her nerves taut. At this pain, Han Yunxi’s derisive smile turned into soft laughter. All that fellow did was massage her foot a few times. How could she forget the awkwardness of her identity and really treat herself as someone special?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did she climb the south mountains? Why go harvest Red South Peak?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you laughing about?” Qingyi asked guardedly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi glanced at her, her smile turning cold as she refused to answer. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This woman’s smile was determined and decisive, carrying with it a fierceness to rival a man’s. Qingyi couldn’t help but suddenly feel a sense of dread as she snagged Han Yunxi by the collar. “What are you smiling for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silent Qingyi had finally opened her mouth to speak. Han Yunxi looked at her coldly, her smile turning even more intense. She just wouldn’t open her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qingyi grew even more anxious as she jostled her collar. “Talk, why are you smiling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet right at this instant, a low, fierce voice suddenly rose from behind them. “Qingyi, you idiotic woman, you’ve been tailed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qingyi gave a start and turned her head, only to see a masked figure had suddenly appeared behind her. His figure was tall and lofty, the wind whipping through his dark cloak. A ferocious-looking mask obscured his face, only revealing his mouth. His gaze was cruel and vicious enough to distract viewers from his mask so that they only saw his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master!” Qingyi blurted out.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Master!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi’s chest heaved. She knew that this masked figure had to be the official leader of the Northern Li spies and the high-level poisons expert she was curious about. All of a sudden, the masked man pressed closer, mysterious and dark, his fiendish eyes staring straight at Han Yunxi. Frightened, she wanted to back away but found that Qingyi was holding her in place so that she couldn’t budge a step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were the one who released the Mosquito Incense, right?” the masked man asked, voice so low that it might have come from the depths of Hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi shivered involuntarily. But despite her fear, she was more interested in the words he’d just said. Qingyi had been followed? It couldn’t be that someone had really chased them here by following the mosquito swarm?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But who?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Han Yunxi hadn’t answered, the man seized her roughly by the chin, enough to make Han Yunxi feel like her bones were about to break.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Answer your lord’s question!” his voice was filled with killing intent, enough to turn Qingyi timid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Han Yunxi firmly wrenched her chin aside with a cold voice. “So what if I did?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The masked man’s hand turned stiff. He was about to rage when Han Yunxi spoke again. “You and your quibble with Long Feiye are your own business. Aren’t you ashamed of kidnapping a weak woman like me to threaten him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impudence!” Qingyi exclaimed, raising her hand for a slap. No one had ever dared to be so presumptuous with the master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet the masked man actually moved Qingyi aside, voice cold. “Worthless, you can get lost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So speaking, he tugged with his hands to forcibly drag Han Yunxi from Qingyi’s arms into his own. Han Yunxi’s face smashed against his chest so hard that her face hurt, almost enough to make her tear up. Such an embrace was filled with his overbearing, tyrannical air, both unfamiliar and terrifying. Han Yunxi indignantly raised her head and snarled, “Let me go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the masked man only smiled coldly. “Han Yunxi, you’ve misunderstood. Your lord didn’t kidnap you to threaten Long Feiye. Rather...you’re the one I want!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He wanted her?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t understand what his words meant, but just by looking into his eyes, Han Yunxi could sense the strong possessive desire hiding within those pupils.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, she was truly afraid!</span></p>
