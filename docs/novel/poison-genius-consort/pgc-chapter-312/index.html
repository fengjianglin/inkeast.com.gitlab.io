 <p>Chapter 312: Empress Dowager's birthday banquet (6)&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was tasting the fine wine while enjoying the song and dance. Groups of twos and threes broke out in scattered conversation throughout the hall. Chu Qingge’s loud voice wouldn’t have attracted much notice, but she got everyone's attention as soon as she said </span><i><span style>‘Qin Wangfei.'</span></i><span style> There was no helping it. Han Yunxi was a central figure in everything. Moreover, the person by her side had caused such a ruckus at this banquet that it’d be hard-pressed to find anyone </span><i><span style>not </span></i><span style>interested in her name. Once again, the lively audience hall fell silent. Emperor Tianhui and the empress dowager looked at Chu Qingge as well. This was exactly what she wanted! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi found herself somewhat at a loss. She knew Chu Qingge would find a chance to get revenge for what had happened at the restaurant, but she never expected the girl to call her out here. She had no idea what she was thinking. This might be the empress dowager’s birthday banquet, but it was really a place for men to talk. Why was she, as a female, making such a fuss?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” she asked coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei’s </span></i><span style>talents are the top in Tianning. Even our Princess Duan was defeated at your hands. Nowadays, all of Cloud Realm Continent says that Princess Duan’s talents can’t be compared to Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei,” </span></i><span style>Chu Qingge said with a smile. </span></p>
 <p><span style>By her side, Duanmu Baiye’s face immediately turned dark. </span><i><span style>What is this woman doing? Why is she bringing up Yao Yao now of all times? Hasn’t Yao Yao lost enough face? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Tianyin furrowed his eyebrows and tugged harshly at Chu Qingge, but she simply ignored him to keep talking. “Such talents include things like poetry, singing, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style>qin</span></i></a> <span style>playing, calligraphy, and painting. It’s a pity that esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>only bested Princess Duan in poetry composition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Baiye’s expression cleared up at these words, like a moon breaking out from behind the clouds. He suddenly realized that this was a prime opportunity to recover Yao Yao’s face! After all, the ice beauty Chu Qingge typically disdained competing in martial arts skills or going to female get-togethers. But her talents vastly exceeded that of Yao Yao’s. She could be considered the true number one gifted female of Western Zhou. Her words were clearly meant as a challenge for Han Yunxi!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Han Yunxi would definitely lose against her!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi remained looking coldly at Chu Qingge without saying a word in reply. Chu Qingge simply pressed her on with each sentence. “Qingge invites Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>to play a piece to showcase Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei’s qin </span></i><span style>skills. It could be considered a gift to amuse Esteemed Empress Dowager on her birthday as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A mocking lilt rose in Han Yunxi’s lips. It was obvious that this girl wanted to compete in the </span><i><span style>qin </span></i><span style>with her to seek revenge for Duanmu Yao! </span><i><span style>Look at her skilled words. In the space of a few sentences, she’s even pulled the empress dowager to her side. </span></i><span style>Moreover, the empress dowager was currently distressing over the fact that she couldn’t get back at Han Yunxi. Chu Qingge’s suggestion interested her immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Han Yunxi could speak up, the empress dowager slapped the table. “Good! A fine idea. I’ve heard of Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei’s </span></i><span style>talented name spreading throughout the world as well. Today, I’ll use this chance to see for myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Empress Dowager, how about the two of us take turns to play accompaniment to this Flourishing Peach Blossom dance?” Chu Qingge quickly suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perfect, perfect!” the empress dowager was very happy. If there were two performances, there could be comparisons, and with that, judging. Naturally, she’d give Han Yunxi a poor score. It wasn’t easy to perform together with an ensemble, either. One of the hardest </span><i><span style>qin </span></i><span style>skills was to play accompaniment to a live performance. This not only tested the player’s </span><i><span style>qin </span></i><span style>skills, but her musicality and artistic style as well. A </span><i><span style>qin </span></i><span style>player had to reach a certain high level before they could accomplish the feat. Typical players started studying the instrument while they were still primary-school age. They also needed professional instruction from court musicians, or else they wouldn’t know what to do. Of course the Chu Clan could afford to hire music teachers of their own, but as for Han Yunxi’s family...</span><i><span style>heheheh. </span></i><span style>Both Chu Qingge and the empress dowager were certain that Han Yunxi didn’t know how to play a </span><i><span style>qin!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Truly, Han Yunxi had no idea. Forget about playing accompaniment, she couldn’t even read notation for music from the past. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yunxi, come, come. Play a tune to cheer me up,” the empress dowager said, half-joking, half-commanding. She had no way to throw aside her face and ask for presents outright, so she had been helpless against Long Feiye and the other guests who hadn’t given gifts. But no matter how strong the Duke of Qin was, or how rebellious Han Yunxi turned, there was no way either of them could disobey a direct command at her birthday banquet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi hesitated for a long time before she replied, “Esteemed Empress Dowager, how about Miss Chu goes first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Chu Qingge and the empress dowager were secretly delighted with her reply. If Han Yunxi was in such sore straits now, there was bound to be a show to see later. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Empress Dowager, Qingge will have to display her poor performance,” Chu Qingge said modestly, though she couldn’t wait to show off her skills. Since Long Feiye was here tonight, she’d seize the chance to attract his attention. She’d been waiting for this opportunity since forever. </span><i><span style>Today, I’m going to let Long Feiye know that I’m tons better than Han Yunxi!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A precious </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzheng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>zither</span></a><span style> was carried to the audience hall. Once Chu Qingge took her seat, all the other musicians stopped playing. The group of pink-robed dancers surrounded her on all sides. Chu Qingge was dressed in ethereal white robes that gave off a chilly air. The contrast between her clothes and the pink dresses of the dancers were like an illusory dream. She seemed fresh and refined amongst them like a celestial fairy who had descended from the Heavens into a grove of peach blossom trees. Everyone who saw her were intoxicated with the sight. Even Emperor Tianhui found himself interested in the girl. As always, Long Feiye was the sole exception. He poured himself some wine, seemingly lost in his own world as he completely ignored the beautiful scene of the girl and her instrument.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chu Qingge saw that Long Feiye wasn’t looking at her, she resentfully started playing. Today, she was definitely going to attract his attention! With a single note, the dancers came to life. Chu Qingge was wholly absorbed in her music. She didn’t have the dancers accompany her melody, but used her music to accompany their movements. It was the same Flourishing Peach Blossom dance as before, but the music was completely different. It took its listeners from a frigid winter with its dreary, desolate air into the joyful warmth of spring and its blossoming flowers. The joyous melody continued until spring came to an end. Flower petals scattered and fell, leaving a sentimental, yet sorrowful tune in the air. Together, the dance and music made a stirring combination, creating something far superior than the original score. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone grew entranced as they watched and listened. After Chu Qingge finished her final note, the dancers stopped. Slowly, the people recovered their senses as well. The empress dowager clapped her hands together and exclaimed, “Good! Most excellent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were sighs of admiration and spoken praises from the crowd. But Chu Qingge only had Long Feiye in her eyes--the same man who hadn’t spared her a glance throughout the entire song. She was extremely disappointed! Standing up, she faced Han Yunxi and said, “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>it’s your turn now.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Maybe Long Feiye will only know how well I played if there’s someone else to compare with.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh, don’t you lose face for me or our Tianning Country,” the empress dowager couldn’t wait.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Han Yunxi was sitting indolently in her seat, a hand propping up her chin. She had no intentions of getting up at all as she grinned. “Miss Chu is indeed formidable. I even lost myself in your music just then. You played very well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>praises wrongly. Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>must be an even better player than Qingge,” Chu Qingge purposely acted modest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi wore an expression filled with worry. “How could that be? You and the dancers make for a splendid match. That’s not something this </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>could ever accomplish.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qingge could tell there was something odd about those choice of words, but she wasn’t clear on </span><i><span style>what. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yunxi, hurry and play a piece,” the empress dowager urged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Han Yunxi simply laughed. “Esteemed Empress Dowager certainly knows how to jest! Yunxi isn’t some servant! How could I play accompaniment to these dancers? What sort of proper decorum is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These musicians, singers, and dancers were all servants in the end. No matter whether they sang, danced, or play tunes, they were all there for the purposing of catering to their master so he would be happy. Han Yunxi was a proper and upright Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei. </span></i><span style>How could she ever display her skills at the same level as a bunch of court dancers?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Certainly, she’d let Chu Qingge go first, but she’d never agreed to perform herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she spoke, Han Yunxi openly commended Chu Qingge. “It really is a pity that Miss Chu didn’t become a musician instead!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words were like a vicious slap against Chu Qingge’s face. </span><i><span style>How could Han Yunxi do this? </span></i><span style>The thing she took pride in was simply servant’s work in Han Yunxi’s eyes! </span><i><span style>What about Long Feiye? Is that what he thinks too? </span></i><span style>Chu Qingge was infuriated. Yet when she saw Han Yunxi dressed in violet robes sitting next to Long Feiye, she couldn’t help but fear inferior to them both.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Instead of answering Han Yunxi, Chu Qingge turned to look at the empress dowager instead. She was certain that the empress dowager wouldn’t let go of this chance to beat back Han Yunxi. Indeed, the empress dowager hated Han Yunxi even more than Chu Qingge! How could she simply give up?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yunxi, you agreed to the terms just then. Don’t make me unhappy,” the empress dowager said with a smile, but there were daggers hidden behind her grin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Empress Dowager, Yunxi only agreed to let Miss Chu play first. When did I ever agree to play myself?” Han Yunxi intentionally acted like a spoiled child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since she’s played her piece, you should go next,” the empress dowager remained stubborn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t say I’d follow her! She played the first piece, so why not have her play the next as well?” Han Yunxi said reasonably despite being a rascal all the while. At this, many of the people present laughed. Mu Linger was the one who laughed the loudest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qingge was a proud type. How could she take the abuse? Huffily, she demanded, “Esteemed Empress Dowager, is Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>going back on her words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the empress dowager turned serious as her voice grew cold. “Yunxi, I want you…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time she spoke, Han Yunxi lazily withdrew a fan from behind her body. First she twirled it around a few times in her hands, then began to calmly fan herself. As soon as the empress dowager saw this fan, she shut up. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heavens!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That was the Medicine Fan. She’d been on a painstaking search for that very fan for decades. Every day, she wished the moment it’d fall into her hands, so she could recognize it at a glance. The Medicine Fan was the ultimate cure for insomnia! She’d suffered from insomnia since she was young and found it difficult to go to bed every night. She’d have to toss and turn for at least four hours before she finally fell asleep, but any little noise could wake her up. When that happened, she’d be stuck with her eyes open until day broke. Naturally, she’d eaten no end of medicine, or else she wouldn’t have survived to this day. Her mood was none too good in the daytime, either. But every medicine had its side effects, so she’d long grew fearful of eating so many pills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The former Head Imperial Physician had prescribed a medicine that could cure her without daily intakes or harmful effects to the body, the Medicine Fan. But she hadn’t found any trace of it until today. She never expected the item to end up in Han Yunxi’s hands! Only someone who suffered from insomnia could understand her sufferings. The empress dowager stared at the object in Han Yunxi’s hands. Why would she bother causing Han Yunxi trouble now? She was so moved that she could simply cry from joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were few people who could recognize the Medicine Fan at a glance, and Chu Qingge wasn’t one of them. Neither was she aware of the empress dowager’s condition. When she saw that the woman hadn’t spoken, she quickly added, “Esteemed Empress Dowager, don’t your Tianning </span><i><span style>wangfei’s </span></i><span style>words count for anything?”</span></p>
