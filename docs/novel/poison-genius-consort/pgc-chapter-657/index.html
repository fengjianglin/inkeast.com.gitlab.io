 <p style="text-align: left;">Chapter <span style>657: Who stole her things?</span><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>So what if she was an old disciple of the sword sect master? So what if she was naturally talented and a genius at martial arts? In the end, she was still beaten in one blow by this “good-for-nothing waste,” Han Yunxi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, it was barely one move at all. Han Yunxi didn’t even use her hands, but only revealed the hidden needle halfway out of her mouth before she scared Duanmu Yao into a retreat! It wasn’t clear how Duanmu Yao’s cohorts would twist the facts to spread their rumors, but Long Feiye had already ordered his men to spread the truth, including sending a delegation to tell the news straight to Celestial Mountain. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, the Celestial Mountain Sword Sect was the leader of the martial arts circles. Its disciples were all proud of their sect and had high standards for themselves. If they knew that Duanmu Yao had been defeated by someone who didn’t even know martial arts, they’d roast her for shaming the face of Celestial Mountain Sword Sect!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duanmu Yao, if you don’t speak, then I’ll take it you accept your defeat?” Han Yunxi asked next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao was depressed. Her perfect plan had been flawless. Senior brother wouldn’t strike at all for fear of master, while she’d attacked Han Yunxi first and then reveal the evidence of her mother’s murder to demand her blood deby. But reality had proved otherwise. Was still dreaming? </span><i><span style>Dammnit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, I’m not here to compare marital arts with you!” Duanmu Yao blurted out coldly. “I won’t discuss who wins or loses here, but I </span><i><span style>will </span></i><span style>take your life to avenge my mother’s!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She waved her sword, and ten swordmaidens strode out of the crowd. Long Feiye recognized them all as Duanmu Yao’s personally trained swordswomen from Celestial Mountain Sword Sect. All of them had formidable sword skills, so their combined strength equaled to Duanmu Yao’s own. She really had steeled her heart to kill Han Yunxi today!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye’s icy eyes narrowed with terrifying killing intent. Sensing his displeasure, Han Yunxi withdrew to his side and rested her hand over his fist to comfort him silently. This was enough to calm him down again. Actually, Long Feiye didn’t have to worry. The Han Yunxi of today was nothing like her former self. In the past, she had fears--worry that Tianning’s imperial court would cause them trouble, or that a single misstep could ruin Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei’s </span></i><span style>namesake and offend His Highness Duke of Qin. But now, her greatest fear had become her greatest source of strength. What was there to be afraid of?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duanmu Yao, you can’t just challenge others on a whim! Are you going back on your words?” Han Yunxi asked with a grin. She didn’t give the girl a change to explain, but continued, “That’s fine, too! If it’s a group match, I have people on my side, too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone looked towards His Highness Duke of Qin at those words. Although he stood there expressionlessly with no intentions to get involved, their hearts still sped up at the thought of a potential match! His Highness Duke of Qin had enough strength to take on all of Duanmu Yao’s allies just by himself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally, Duanmu Yao dreaded the very thought. “Han Yunxi, this princess came today to seek revenge! Stop dallying here and there! No one’s going to challenge you one or one or as a group!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi sighed. “Then just what are you trying to do? You were the one who declared a match and brought allies! If it’s not one on one or a group match, are you expecting this </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>to just stand by like a fool while you hack me to death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha!” Gu Qi Sha burst into guffaws, followed by a few more voices in the crowd. Duanmu Yao’s actions, in Han Yunxi’s words, were truly hilarious. Even with Long Feiye’s agents, people would spread the joke of their own accord. For sure, the girl was losing face today!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Embarrassed and angry, Duanmu Yao just couldn’t believe it. Why did her revenge mission turn into a farce? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone come, charge! Kill her!” she cried. The ten swordswoman all swept forward, just as countless black-robed swordsmen appeared out of thin air to shield Han Yunxi from the front. Han Yunxi didn’t grasp the full implications, but both Gu Qi Sha and Mu Linger were shocked. That was because all of these men were radiating killing intent. Without a doubt, their martial arts skills far surpassed those of Duanmu Yao’s faction. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao herself sensed the danger and raged, “Senior brother, Han Yunxi killed my imperial mother. I won’t demand that you uphold justice on behalf your junior sister, but please don’t shield other people’s faults! You should be explaining yourself to my imperial father and my Western Zhou’s people instead!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye’s voice was cold. “Where’s the proof? Smearing my beloved consort’s name without reason means you owe your lordship an explanation as well! If you can’t provide the evidence, don’t blame your lordship for being rude!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao’s eyes grew wet with tears. She took out an acupuncture needle from her sleeve with a sorry air and raised it high above her head for the crowds. “This was taken from the body of my imperial mother. There was poison on the tip. Only Han Yunxi uses acupuncture needles like these. Besides her, no one else has them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, the needle in her hands belonged to Han Yunxi’s usual store. They had been brought hr via the detox system from the present day, so their make and material differed from medical needles of ancient times. It really was a source of proof. But Han Yunxi rarely used these needles unless she was treating someone in an emergency. When she was done, she’d disinfect and store them away. There were only a few exceptions when she left them behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from Chu Tianyin, who else could have gotten their hands on them? Chu Qingge? Ning Cheng? And where?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was too lazy to pursue the matter. If the other side wanted to smear her, they would’ve found a way to get ‘evidence’ anyways. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, tell me. Is this your needle or not?” Duanmu Yao asked loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! When did you steal my things? Give it back!” Han Yunxi said confidently.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You!” </span></i><span style>Duanmu Yao got angry every time Han Yunxi spoke. She was almost going to die from rage. “You used this acupuncture needle to kill my imperial mother. What else do you have to say for yourself?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You stole my acupuncture needle and slandered me for using poison. What do you </span><i><span style>think </span></i><span style>I have to say?” Han Yunxi retorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, you...you...you’re resorting to sophistry!” Duanmu Yao was almost ready to spit up blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Today you bring an acupuncture needle and accuse me of killing your imperial mother. Then tomorrow will you bring an assassination needle and accuse me of killing your entire clan next?” Han Yunxi demanded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd was silent. No one dared to speed, while Duanmu Yao was beginning to pant with breath from desperation. “The coroner’s already determined the cause of death. My mother died from poisoning. Moreover, the Chu Clan barracks had someone who personally witnessed you at the scene of the crime that night!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Here was both physical and eyewitness evidence. If the proof had been provided from a neutral third party, then according to Cloud Realm’s laws, Han Yunxi was guilty. But unfortunately, all of the evidence came from Duanmu Yao’s side and thus remained highly suspect. Han Yunxi was too lazy to debate with them on the plausibility of submitted evidence. With Duanmu Yaos’ unreasonable, tediously, piss-poor personality, they’re never hear the end of it. She and Long Feiye had long discussed a way to kill two stratagems with one shot. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as they could prove the evidence--her acupuncture needle--was only there to frame her, then there was no need to prod at the true cause of Empress Xue’s death. In that case, Duanmu Yao would naturally move to suspect whoever gave her the needle to form her case instead. Once she was distracted by the new developments, this matter would have nothing more to do with them at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which coroner did you find to inspect the body?” Han Yunxi asked next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Peaceful Pavilion’s Lin Xu!”[1. </span><i><span style>Lin Xu </span></i><span style>(林旭) - </span><i><span style>Lin </span></i><span style>is a surname that means “forest,” </span><i><span style>Xu </span></i><span style>is “brilliance of the rising sun.”] Duanmu Yao declared loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Peaceful Pavilion was a for-profit institution that inspected corpses for both the royal court and the common people in Tianning. Lin Xin was its star coroner with a well-known reputation! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t believe him!” Han Yunxi said coldly. “Unless you find someone to inspect the corpse again and prove that Empress Xue really did die from poison--from that needle, no less--this </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>won’t accept the accusation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Qingge had done her work for Duanmu Yao’s sake and purposely bribed Lin Xu to tell Duanmu Yao the results of his autopsy. Duanmu Yao had no reason to mistrust Chu Qingge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Might as well! This princess wants to you admit it utterly!” Duanmu Yao was full of confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then find the foremost coroner in Western Zhou’s imperial court of justice, Cao Tong[2. </span><i><span style>Cao Tong </span></i><span style>(曹同) - </span><i><span style>Cao </span></i><span style>is a surname take means “people of the same kind,” </span><i><span style>Tong </span></i><span style>means “be the same as,” “same/alike similar,” “together/in common.”]--Great Coroner Cao!” Han Yunxi said slowly word by word so everyone in the crowd could hear her clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was scared to death by her declaration. They began to wonder if Duanmu Yao really was here to smear Han Yunxi after all. There was no way the very justice courts of Western Zhou would stand on Han Yunxi’s side. They would only seek the truth. Moreover, Great Coroner Cao was Cloud Realm Continent’s foremost coroner with first-rate autopsy skills. His words would be irrefutable! The fact that Han Yunxi dared to invite him at all meant that she had no guilty conscience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao laughed out loud. “Han Yunxi, don’t play pretend! You know that Cao Tong’s been retired for years! It’ll be impossible to invite him here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And if I can?” Han Yunxi challenged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a joke!” Duanmu Yao still refused to believe it. Cao Tong had broken many cases for the Western Zhou imperial court, but he’d been in private retirement for many years. Her imperial father had once sent the crown prince to invite him over but still failed to call him from the mountains. What powers did Han Yunxi have to invite him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Coroner Cao’s already on his way here. He’ll arrive within two days. Duanmu Yao, if you’re still a filial daughter who wants to know the cause of your mother’s death, hurry up and bring her body here,” Han Yunxi said seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao grew stunned when she realized Han Yunxi wasn’t kidding around. A frightening thought rose up in her mind: </span><i><span style>suppose that Han Yunxi isn’t the culprit? What if I’ve been used by Chu Qingge? What if the Chu Clan are the true murderers?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She quickly recovered her senses, refusing to accept her suspicions. She was already convinced that Han Yunxi was the killer and just trying to scare her instead! Viciously she cried, “Fine! Two days later, I’ll make you eat your words and return a life for a life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two days later, Cao Tong really showed up at the side courtyard in Yaoshui!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was able to invite him in the first place because of Medical City’s Third Elder Shen’s secret help. As an Elder of Medical City, he couldn’t publicly support Han Yunxi, so Cao Tong’s appearance would hide the details of their friendship. Moreover, the coroner was an old official of Western Zhou and had vowed to discover the truth of Empress Xue’s death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Princess, don’t worry. This one will definitely make sure esteemed empress can rest in peace!” Cao Tong said sincerely, still referring to Duanmu Yao as the princess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao’s steadfast heart wavered at his words. She nodded and said, “My imperial mother’s body is resting in the courtyard at the end of the alley. Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd followed Cao Tong, while Long Feiye and Gu Qi Sha accompanied Han Yunxi. Gu Qi Sha muttered, “Did you guys bribe Cao Tong to your side?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi muttered back, “It’s already good enough that we managed to invite him here! Bribing a guy like him is impossible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then aren’t you afraid that he’ll expose the truth?” Gu Qi Sha said in alarm. After all, Han Yunxi may not have killed Empress Xue, but Long Feiye’s men certainly did!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The title of World’s Greatest Coroner wasn’t just for show!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Where did Long Feiye and Han Yunxi get the confidence? What kind of drugs were they on?</span></p>
