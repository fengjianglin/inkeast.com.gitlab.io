 <p>Chapter 58: A fall and his choice&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This white-robed female dares to steal from Long Feiye, is she sick of living? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Han Yunxi mused, a sudden burst of poison gas rose from the trees, heading towards the woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beware of poison!” Suddenly, Long Feiye cried out in alarm and flew down in a split second!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was he trying to block her or save her?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>With his personality, he’d either snort </span><i><span style>‘serves them right’ </span></i><span style>or </span><i><span style>‘she’s looking for death,’ </span></i><span style>wouldn’t he? Han Yunxi was confused as she watched in disbelief. Very quickly, she verified that she hadn’t seen or heard wrongly. She never thought that Long Feiye had moments when he lost his cool.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What kind of woman is that white-robed female?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye’s speed was too fast for the eyes to see. There was only a flash of black before she saw him again, carrying the white-robed female as he flew towards a tree on the opposite side. Seeing those two forms pressed together made Han Yunxi’s heart give a start, but she quickly ignored it. As the white poisonous mist dispersed, peace returned to the thicket, but it wasn’t clear whether the snake head had died. Han Yunxi looked towards the opposite trees, where Long Feiye was saying something to the woman. Unfortunately, she was too far to see what she looked like or hear what they were talking about.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who exactly is that woman? What’s her relationship with Long Feiye?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Han Yunxi puzzled over these questions, a shockwave swept through the mountain. The poison python was turning over its body, its movements causing that giant tail to thrash against Han Yunxi’s tree. Seeing the approaching tail, Han Yunxi was at a loss. She glanced towards Long Feiye, who was about to come over when the white-robed female suddenly made a dash for the snake head again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get back here!” Long Feiye yelled, but the white-robed female only gave him a backward glance. A provoked expression appeared in her eyes as she increased her speed to fly down. At the same time, the snake tail crashed heavily into Han Yunxi’s tree branch with a giant </span><i><span style>BANG.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah…!” Han Yunxi was terrified. She was about a few dozen meters up, but jumping or staying might both lead to her death. All she could do was hold onto the tree branch and hope the tree could topple slowly over instead. Yet the poison python tail swung once again at her tree.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>BANG!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah…!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi might have been tightly gripping the branch, but the ramming strength made it impossible to continue to hold on. Her hands unconsciously loosened as she fell straight down. Long Feiye saw everything happen, but a complicated expression flitted past his eyes before he turned to chase after the white-robed female. Han Yunxi’s four limbs were facing the sky as she fell. She didn’t catch Long Feiye turning around his head, but she knew that with his speed, he would’ve saved her by now if he chose to!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But he didn’t come.</span></i> <i><span style>He never came!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t know when she’d hit the ground or whether it’d hurt. Han Yunxi closed her eyes as her voice grew choked with sobs. “Long Feiye, you bastard! I’ll hate you even after I die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Han Yunxi was falling, Long Feiye had already caught up with the white-robed female and kicked her away from the poison python.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice was cold. “Duanmu Yao[1], show some propriety!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And here I thought Feiye </span><i><span style>gege</span></i><span style>[2] stopped caring whether Yao Yao[3] lived or died after he married his wife,” Duanmu Yao’s white robes carried an ethereal beauty, making her seem like a celestial maiden of the Ninth Heaven[4]. When she smiled, two dimples appeared to make her even cuter. She was the princess of Western Zhou Country, Tianning Country’s ally state, as well as Long Feiye’s junior sister under a shared master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your lordship will say this once, get lost or I won’t be polite!” Long Feiye said coldly. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Han Yunxi about to hit the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao raised an eyebrow and glanced over. “Feiye </span><i><span style>gege, </span></i><span style>would you say my life is important? Or your </span><i><span style>wangfei’s?”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, she prepared to fly towards the poison python head again. This was obviously threatening Long Feiye with her own life! A flash of heinous rage flitted past Long Feiye’s eyes as he spoke, “If you want to die, wait until after your 18th birthday! Your lordship can send you off on the journey then!” He turned his body sideways and used a leg to viciously kick Duanmu Yao aside. On the one hand, it drove her far into the forest; on the other, it gave him a burst of speed that propelled him to Han Yunxi’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi had already given up hope. Although her eyes were closed as she fell backwards towards the ground, she really felt that she was about to hit it at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did people who jump off buildings feel like this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Very soon, the back of her head would ram into the ground and spill out her brains? Her four limbs would be shattered upon impact? </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who said, with him here, she didn’t need to be afraid?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who said, there wouldn’t be any untimely ends?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A teardrop wordlessly slipped out from the corner of her eye. She gritted her teeth and forced her eyes open. Even if she was going to die, she still wanted to see this world one last time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet as she did, she saw before her a handsome man’s face, the features sculpted and as cold as ice. His eyes were like frozen pools of water, his lips as thin and fine as cicada’s wings. Something so familiar, yet so foreign at the same time...</span><i><span style>Long Feiye!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi couldn’t resist smiling. Was this a hallucination before her death? She didn’t realized she was still hoping for him to rescue her. Long Feiye leaned forward to grab her waist, pulling her into his arms as they slowly descended to earth. Han Yunxi just felt that this was a very realistic hallucination, but as beautiful as a wonderful dream. For a moment, everything disappeared from the world, only leaving her and him. She forgot her fear and her hate, indulging herself with the vision of his deep eyes. Unconsciously, she reached out a hand and lightly caressed his cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in that instant, she saw Long Feiye’s handsome face scrunch up its eyebrows, his cold eyes turning even colder. It startled Han Yunxi to her senses.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This guy is knitting his eyebrows...this guy is real!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She was shocked speechless, her hand turning stiff against his face. As for him, he let go as soon as they touched the ground before slapping away her fingers away. Han Yunxi’s legs collapsed beneath her as she tumbled to the ground, finally regaining her wits. Thinking back to her inadvertent actions, Han Yunxi blushed. She felt so awkward that she forgot to climb to her feet. Long Feiye’s face grew dark as he looked disdainfully at her from the corner of his eye, before finally extending a helping hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi’s face was completely red, but she still felt a hint of warmth when she saw his large palm. Just when she was about to take it, Long Feiye spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Troublesome.” His tone was cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With these words, Han Yunxi’s hand froze in place before she withdrew it. Disappointment flashed in her eyes, to be quickly replaced with anger! She didn’t even want to come along, but he forced her to so she could treat snake poison. She’d suffered through such a large shock without blaming him once. But he, </span><i><span style>he </span></i><span style>started taking offense first. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Look at the warmth she’d felt in her heart. From the start, everything had been a one-sided wish from her side. Just then, he’d chosen someone else when her life hung in the balance. He hadn’t cared whether she lived or died, but probably rushed back to save her because it’d be hard to explain her death to Emperor Tianhui. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi pushed off from the ground with both hands to stand up abruptly, glaring at Long Feiye. “My life is cheap so I’m troublesome. Well, you sought out your own troubles! Bring back this </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>in the same condition that you brought her out! If I’m missing even a single hair, then this </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>won’t be able to treat the crown prince!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye’s disgusted expression turned slightly stiff as he spoke, “Don’t be such a coward. You still have your life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So speaking, he avoided Han Yunxi’s glare and looked towards the poison python. It was spasming and still spewing poisonous gas, but not as much as before. These were obviously its death throes. Han Yunxi couldn’t utter a word because of her anger, before finally hesitating and saying nothing at all. She couldn’t help but wonder, </span><i><span style>where’s that white-robed female? Did she leave?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That woman was so intent on the snake head. If she didn’t come for the snake dan, then what was she doing? She probably knows Long Feiye. He saved her just then because he was worried that she’d get poisoned.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Curiouser and curiouser. More than that though, Han Yunxi was still furious. Didn’t Long Feiye knew that she’d be dead if he came a second later? In any case, he was the one that brought her out. Was he going to treat her life as trash?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye waited for the python to die as Han Yunxi crossed her legs and sat down in silence. If it wasn’t for fear of the poison, Long Feiye’s abilities would’ve long obtained the snake </span><i><span style>dan. </span></i><span style>Now all they could do was wait for the python to use up the last of its energy, but it wasn’t long before he lost his patience. He jumped onto a nearby tree and took out his bow and arrow, aiming for the source of the poison gases before launching an offensive.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swish swish swish!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Arrows after arrows flew down with even more strength than before, spraying fresh blood everywhere. Han Yunxi’s heart trembled with fear at the sight. She belatedly realized that this fellow was very unhappy and using the arrows to vent out his anger! If she didn’t have any counters on hand, would she become an outlet for his anger as well? Her hair stood on end at the thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words just then couldn’t be enough to set this guy off. In his eyes, she was of no consequence, so the white-robed female must have done something. Han Yunxi didn’t want to be curious about so many things, but she ended up wondering anyways. Though she knew he probably wouldn’t answer, she still wanted to ask him about it. She equivocated for a bit before deciding that she was still angry. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They were in a cold war! She wouldn’t ask!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though Long Feiye’s offensive was fierce, this poison python had lived for many years and wouldn’t die so easily. Its tail was still thrashing around as its head rose multiple times, leaking fresh blood as it sprayed poison mist into the surroundings. Seeing this, Long Feiye grew even more impatient and jumped off the tree, walking forward to look for a better shooting spot. Han Yunxi watched his retreating back with a gloomy face. Silently she thought, </span><i><span style>Surname Long, just go. Go far away. Leave me here so if anything happens, you’ll take responsibility!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yet Long Feiye hadn’t walked a few steps before he turned back to gaze down at Han Yunxi with a single command: “Get up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What for?” Han Yunxi asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye didn’t answer, but dragged her upright and held her tight, flying into the air until they alighted on a tree nearby that was 70 meters tall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh!” Han Yunxi cried out until they reached the top of the tree. She just narrowly escaped death from falling and was still suffering from the aftershocks, all right? She wouldn’t be able to climb trees for a year!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye was both stern and impatient. “What are you hollering for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi took the chance to turn around and bury her head in his chest, arms wrapped tightly around him. She was both angry and afraid. “Long Feiye, I’m warning you, if you leave me alone on a tree again, I definitely...I definitely…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye waited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Han Yunxi’s brains had short-circuited, leaving her stalling on </span><i><span style>‘definitely’ </span></i><span style>before she declared, “I definitely won’t forgive you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye gave a start, lowering his head to see that the person by his chest was actually trembling. Unexpectedly, his lips curved up minutely. Most likely, no one had told him his smile made the entire world pale in comparison. That was because no one had ever seen him smile simply for the sake of smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He allowed Han Yunxi to hold onto him as he gathered his bow and arrow to aim towards the giant mouth of the python.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shuaaa…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Straight into the mouth with one shot!</span></p>
