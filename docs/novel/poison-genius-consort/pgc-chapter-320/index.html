 <p>Chapter 320: A good&nbsp;<em>mama&nbsp;</em>atones for her crimes with good deeds&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi coughed as hard as she could, but with no success. Long Feiye was so anxious that he kept patting her back, though he was afraid to use any real strength. When he heard Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s</span></i><span style> reminder, he shifted to her front and lightly pressed down with his hand. Again and again, he repeated the motion with his fingertips until Han Yunxi suddenly felt a jolt of electricity pass through her chest to spread all over her body, leaving her somewhat numb. She sucked in a cold breath as her air passages cleared up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her lips pursed into a tight line as her body stiffened. She didn’t dare to cough any further, but her red face grew so scarlet that it looked like it would burst into flames. She wanted to move Long Feiye’s hand away, but her body had frozen in place. Long Feiye was too worried to see what he was doing, and simply stroked his fingers up and down until Han Yunxi stiffened. Only then did Long Feiye notice something amiss and came to a halt, wondering what was up with her now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, what’s wrong?” he asked urgently, eyes furrowed so tightly that it looked like they’d never smooth out again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...I…” Han Yunxi’s ears were burning. “I’m...alright now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What else could she say? His hand was still touching her chest! She wasn’t sure whether that shrewd old Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>had seen everything, but the old woman was standing off to the side with a smile that wasn’t a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye was completely oblivious. He surveyed Han Yunxi and made sure she was alright before withdrawing his hand. “Eat slowly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he sat back and resumed eating his snow lotus seed soup, as if the anxious man from before was a completely different person altogether. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was in no mood to eat. She kept her head bowed as her heart hammered in her chest, nearly bursting out of her skin. Her heart hadn’t pounded so much even when he’d forcefully kissed her in the past! She knew he hadn’t meant to touch her like that, but what was wrong with her now? She almost couldn’t take her pounding heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>are you still feeling unwell? Why aren’t you eating?” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye immediately lifted his head, though he didn’t say a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No...not that, my throat’s just feeling a bit uncomfortable,” Han Yunxi made up an excuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> immediately poured her a cup of water. “Here, esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei. </span></i><span style>Moisten your throat with this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silence resumed in the room. Han Yunxi discovered that Long Feiye ate very quietly. Soon enough, he was finished. Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>took the chance to nudge Han Yunxi before she spoke. “Your Highness, it’s already so late. Why don’t you stay here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi wasn’t an idiot and immediately realized what Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was up to. She silently pinched Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>but it wasn’t enough to stop her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Hignness, there’s only four more hours until daybreak. You can rest upstairs with </span><i><span style>wangfei</span></i><span style> while this old servant prepares breakfast. Your Highness, it’s probably been awhile since you’ve eaten the soft bean curd made by this old servant.” As Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>spoke, she even pushed Han Yunxi, indicating that she should make Long Feiye stay. Han Yunxi wordlessly pushed back. Long Feiye was an intelligent man; he’d know what Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>meant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye glanced at Han Yunxi. It was only a single look, but she was already embarrassed enough to avoid his gaze. </span><i><span style>He’s not going to think that I’m the one who wants him to stay, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She knew that she always ended up feeling empty when he left her, but she had never harbored thoughts like Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s! </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Some things are simply unthinkable!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that Han Yunxi had fallen into Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>trap. Faced with her current plight, she was even slightly nervous because she didn’t know how he’d reply. Long Feiye didn’t look like he had much to do at all. He poured himself a cup of tea and drank it first before rising to his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that, all the air suppressed in Han Yunxi’s chest scattered, giving her some relief. At the same time, it left behind an emptiness and a faint sense of disappointment that she didn’t even notice herself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>disappointment was written all over her face. Her tone was even a little resentful. “Your Highness, it really has been ages since you’ve ate this old servant’s homemade breakfast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Long Feiye simply walked to a long couch on the side and lazily settled down. “Your lordship still has matters to take care of. I’ll leave after resting for two hours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was absolutely thrilled, and urged on Han Yunxi, “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>hurry and get the bedsheets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi still hadn’t realized what was happening, and blankly went upstairs to fetch the sheets. By the time she returned, brocade bed covers in hand, Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was long gone. Long Feiye was leaning indolently against the couch, one hand propping up his head with his eyes shut. His handsome visage seemed less icy and more soft this way. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi stood watching him by the doorway, completely enraptured. It was like she was seeing a painting of an attractive man instead. His beauty was so surreal that she momentarily forgot what she’d come to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before long, Long Feiye opened his eyes and asked, “Han Yunxi, what are you spacing out for?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, he’d noticed her as soon as she reached the door, and had been waiting for her the entire time. Han Yunxi finally recovered her wits and walked over, preparing to cover him with the brocade covers. Unexpectedly, Long Feiye sat up and took off his white outer robes edged with gold. Han Yunxi immediately averted her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Very white...very white… </span></i><span style>But very soon, she couldn’t resist stealing another peek. In her past life, she’d rescued her share of lives and had plenty of men unclothe themselves in front of her eyes. She was used to seeing them naked, but…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Alright, no more bits. It’s not like it’s a big deal if I see some more.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi the dunce probably forgot what happened the first time she saw a naked Long Feiye. By the time she looked back, Long Feiye was in his white inner robes, the V-shaped collar resting just below his Adam’s apple. With its narrow sleeves and form-fitting waist, it made for a clean cut against his figure. When Han Yunxi saw Long Feiye lie down, she quickly placed the covers over him. It had to be said that this fellow looked extremely handsome even when wearing the simplest of clothes!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Alright, so he’s staying here. What about me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye didn’t say a word as he closed his eyes. He looked like he was sleeping, but he could be dozing off as well. Han Yunxi simply stood at his side, not knowing what to do. It felt like she should go upstairs to sleep since it was almost daylight. But protocol dictated that she wait upon her husband if he was here. After a period of internal struggle, Han Yunxi decided to sit by his side. She didn’t notice when Long Feiye’s eyelids fluttered opened to look at her briefly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time passed in the silent room. Even though it was getting brighter, Han Yunxi didn’t feel sleepy at all. She quietly looked at Long Feiye’s peaceful sleeping face and couldn’t help but wonder, </span><i><span style>Did he stay because he really had nothing else to do…? Or is he just giving me face?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She could admit that she couldn’t see through him, and even had trouble seeing through his thoughts with the simplest of things. The more she stared at him, the more foreign he felt. </span><i><span style>Just how many things do I still not know about him? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After a long period of silence, Lil Thing finally poked its head out from beneath the study table. It’d hidden there as soon as Long Feiye arrived, curled up so tightly that its bones had started to ache. Now that Long Feiye was asleep, it immediately scurried out and onto Han Yunxi’s body, nuzzling piteously against her. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mama Yunxi, do you not want me anymore? Why are you letting such a scary cold demon sleep here? Too frightening!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, Long Feiye’s eyes fluttered open. Lil Thing immediately sensed danger as its fur rose in hackles. It jumped off Han Yunxi’s hand and scampered out of sight like a streak of smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you excited over now?” Han Yunxi muttered in bewilderment. Again, she didn’t notice that Long Feiye wasn’t sleeping at all. He was only staying here for two hours, in the end. Eventually, Han Yunxi sat and sat until she fell asleep as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time she woke up, she found herself lying on the long couch with Long Feiye nowhere in sight. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is he eating breakfast? </span></i><span style>She hastily got off the bed before realizing her feet were bare. Someone had arranged her shoes neatly on the side.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did he do it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A rush of warmth filled her heart before she ran outside in her bare feet--only to crash into Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>on her way in. As soon as Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>saw her bare toes, she admonished, “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>you...if His Highness saw, he’d be unhappy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is he?” Han Yunxi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>good mood faded. “Since esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>wouldn’t keep him, did you think this old servant’s bean curd could do the trick?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wouldn’t keep him? </span></i><span style>What kind of methods was Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>thinking she’d use? Han Yunxi sat back on the couch and arched a brow at her. Struck with a guilty conscience, Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>decided to ingratiate herself instead. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>His Highness left as soon as it was daybreak. He said he had business to take care of at Hidden Pavilion, and that he’ll be back in a few days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi looked at her coldly without saying a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>that’s the first time His Highness has told this old servant...no, no, that His Highness has told esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>about his whereabouts!” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>said with a grin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi couldn’t keep calm anymore. “What’s he doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Highness didn’t say. Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>His Highness has tons of things to take care of,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi next asked with interest, “Where is Hidden Pavilion?” She knew of its existence along with the Solitary Enclosure, but she’d only gone to the latter. The Hidden Pavilion seemed like an even more mysterious place. Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>started to chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>this old servant would definitely tell you everything I know. This old servant would rather you know as much as possible about His Highness!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Urk…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Han Yunxi didn’t know how to answer. She forced a smile and pretended she didn’t hear her, but Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>actually grew serious. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>don’t keep wasting time with His Highness! This old servant can tell, His Highness dotes on you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Han Yunxi still didn’t speak, Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>words grew more sincere. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>if there were 100 steps between you and His Highness and you took one step towards him, he’ll definitely finish walking the other 99.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi felt rather pained by the words. She didn’t know how many steps she’d taken already, much less what Long Feiye took in turn. She only knew that the distance between them seemed very far apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>you...what’s the matter?” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>sensed that she’d grown solemn. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But Han Yunxi simply laughed. Her penetrating eyes were bright and luminous as she joked, “Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>can I take 99 steps instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>this old servant was being serious. I wasn’t joking with you!” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>grew anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was still laughing. “This </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>wasn’t joking, either! I’m telling the truth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>felt rather helpless. Han Yunxi took the chance to slip again, her smile still hanging about her lips. She couldn’t help but mutter to herself, “How far away...is 99 steps?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi didn’t rest, but reported to the General Baili’s estate first thing in the morning. Meanwhile, Gu Beiyue went to seek out Emperor Tianhui on his own…</span></p>
