 <p>Chapter 239: Does your husband know?&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>you…” Gu Beiyue caught up after her, unsure of what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was forced until I had no choice, after all, </span><i><span style>sigh…” </span></i><span style>Han Yunxi shrugged her shoulders, her head drooping. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue didn’t know whether to laugh or rage at her current state. He’d always felt that this woman’s skills in poisons were unsurpassed, and that she treated patients with 100 percent seriousness, conscientious and meticulous. But who knew that she could act shamelessly as well? She’d fooled the two directors and Third Elder of medical academy with something so important. As a doctor himself, Gu Beiyue had always hated those who gained fame by deceiving the public with lies, but looking at Han Yunxi’s quiet self, his eyes forgave her and took on a doting light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fortunately, I bought two days’ time,” Han Yunxi’s voice was firm despite bowing her head. Gu Beiyue’s doting gaze deepened as he helplessly shook his head. Unconsciously, he reached out a hand to rub her head--but stopped in mid-air. While Han Yunxi was still looking down, he quickly withdrew that hand until it vanished. Such speeds weren’t possible for even ordinary experts, but his had surpassed them to the point that it left no sound, making it impossible to sense. As he clasped those hands behind his back, Gu Beiyue silently sighed again, feeling the heavy weight of the situation and yet helpless against it. This sort of Gu Beiyue seemed to become another person entirely, one that lacked his usual calm and scholarly, refined air. In its place was a serious and steady man. Han Yunxi didn’t notice any of this, but the Long Feiye who’d been on her tail the entire time saw it all too clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Beiyue…” he muttered to himself, his icy eyes fixated on Gu Beiyue’s arm as if he’d discovered something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you plan to do in two days?” Gu Beiyue asked mildly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have any ideas? If the crown prince can’t be saved, we’ll both have to die,” Han Yunxi said seriously. Though she’d shown off on purpose in front of Third Elder and the rest just then, she hadn’t spared any effort to expel as much poison as possible from Long Tianmo’s joints. Unfortunately, she couldn’t expel it all. Only by applying an antidote could she fully get rid of the toxin. Otherwise, she’d be evicted from Medical City in two days’ time. That wasn’t even the most important part--it was that Long Tianmo wouldn’t survive much longer after that, either. Emperor Tianhui wouldn’t do anything to the medical academy if Long Tianmo died there, but she and Gu Beiyue wouldn’t be able to escape a death sentence. It’d also give Emperor Tianhui full reason to pin the crime on the Duke of Qin’s estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue shook his head. “None, but…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>What he wanted to say was, </span><i><span style>‘None, but we can run away together.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, Han Yunxi was preoccupied with her thoughts and didn’t even hear his </span><i><span style>‘but.’ </span></i><span style>She’d only asked him in passing at most, but was busy thinking over her own ideas already. Her intelligent eyes spun in their sockets before they revealed a hint of mirth. Han Yunxi shuffled closely as she lowered her voice, “I do. Wait for my good news! This matter definitely won’t get anyone into trouble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to win against Third Elder and, more than that, preserve the lives of her and Gu Beiyue, Han Yunxi knew she had to use any methods to get her hands on an antidote! So after some thought, her solution lay in that name: </span><i><span style>Gu Qishao! </span></i><span style>At this critical juncture, finding that fellow Gu Qishao was the best choice. It was harder to climb to Heaven for a person like her with no connections to track down such a mysterious, errant man whose origins were unclear. Fortunately, Han Yunxi could find at least one other person instead. That very night, she find the person in question, Luo Zuishan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Previously, Luo Zuishan hadn’t even spared her a glance; now his gaze on her resembled a searchlight, bright and shining. “Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>must have important business to pay a call here so late,” Luo Zuishan greeted with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very important, and I must trouble Senior Luo with this matter,” Han Yunxi smiled back. Hearing this, Luo Zuishan felt amused. He remembered Han Yunxi and Third Elder’s bet from today. Not only did she have to cure Long Tianmo’s poison, but uncover the truth about his previous chronic ailment resurfacing as well. He thought that Han Yunxi must have come to talk with him about that very ailment. Long Tianmo had been planted with </span><i><span style>Gu </span></i><span style>before. Even if Han Yunxi had Heavenly skills, she’d never be able to tell. In order to win against Third Elder, she’d still have to beg him for help in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as she had a favor to ask him, he could take advantage of the situation and ask how she found those acupoints with her skills. Things such as the identities of those unknown acupoints and those disposable needles were a source of great temptation for a doctor. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no harm telling me what you need!” Luo Zuishan smoothed out his beard, looking the picture of respectability when he was actually secretly delighted. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But Han Yunxi wasn’t here to ask about Long Tianmo’s old ailment at all. She came straight to the point and said, “Where’s Gu Qishao?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as he heard </span><i><span style>‘Gu Qishao,’ </span></i><span style>Luo Zuishan’s hand shook, and he narrowly avoided pulling out his beard. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gu Qishao? Han Yunxi came to him to find Gu Qishao?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since when had she discovered the connection between him and Gu Qishao?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although Gu Qishao was the one to save him from bandits on the journey here, he had been wearing a facemask then. Moreover, Han Yunxi had been kidnapped around the same time as he, so she wasn’t around when he came back. Seeing Luo Zuishan’s reaction, Han Yunxi knew she’d come to the right person. She picked up her teacup and leisurely tasted its contents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu…” Luo Zuishan ignored the pain from his chin and feigned ignorance. “Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>what Gu were you talking about? Imperial Physician Gu? What’s happened to him?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pretending?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even without the kidnapping incidents, Han Yunxi could guess that Gu Qishao and Luo Zuishan had a strong connection based on the former’s boast to get her out of jail. “Not Imperial Physician Gu, but Gu…..Qishao,” Han Yunxi purposely drew out her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Qishao? This old man’s never heard of such a person. I don’t know what Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>could...possibly mean?” Luo Zuishan was a type who wouldn’t admit things even if he was beaten to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was tired. She didn’t have much time to haggle, but maintained her smile and said, “Senior Luo, I’d like to trouble you to bring these words to Gu Qishao. Just say that I want to see him before daybreak, or else…” Han Yunxi paused. She didn’t really have anything to threaten him with, much less tempt him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Or else what?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After some thought under Luo Zuishan’s increasingly disbelieving eyes, Han Yunxi aggressively said, “Or else, he’ll have to shoulder the consequences!” So speaking, she rose to leave without even turning back, leaving Luo Zuishan to gape after her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shoulder the consequences?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just how much had this girl progressed with Gu Qishao? Did she have a handle on him somehow? </span><i><span style>That foolish brat, did he really take a fancy to that girl? Did he tell her one of his secrets? </span></i><span style>Thinking up to here, Luo Zuishan couldn’t be bothered with pretending anymore. He hurried out and went to search everywhere in the academy for Gu Qishao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As things turned out, Han Yunxi had made the right gamble. She’d just gone back to her rooms when Gu Qishao appeared outside her window. “Poison lass, I have to shoulder the consequences? What kind of consequences?” he smiled in amusement. Anyone could tell that he was very happy. Han Yunxi imitated his smile by squinting her eyes and beckoned him over with her finger, signaling him to enter the room. Seeing this, Gu Qishao was even more delighted and obediently climbed through the window. Anyone who saw this might even think these two were about to have an affair! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Gu Qishao entered, Han Yunxi was all business. “Sit down, there’s a favor I have to ask.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>If you asked her why she was so sure that Gu Qishao would come, she wouldn’t be able to answer either. Instinct told her he would. Naturally, Luo Zuishan had told Gu Qishao everything that had happened at the back courtyard of the consultation hall today. He could guess what was going on when he saw Han Yunxi’s serious expression. He too, adopted a businesslike air, though his words couldn’t help but make a listener bristle with anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you’re asking me for a favor, why not pledge your body to me in marriage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi spat out her tea all over Gu Qishao’s face. “Scram!” she said without the slightest hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead of getting angry, Gu Qishao simply wiped his face, still smiling beautifully enough to devastate cities and nations alike. “You can owe me first while you think it over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi threw her teacup at him, absolutely furious. “Get out, out, out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>See her so worked up, Gu Qishao had a rare moment of seriousness and said softly, “All right, all right, just speak. What’s the matter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For one second, Han Yunxi could believe that Gu Qishao had a gentle side as well, but she quickly laughed at the thought. “Help me ask Luo Zuishan what Long Tianmo’s old ailment was,” Han Yunxi said seriously. Luo Zuishan had been so confident in the public consultation that he had to have gotten a handle on things. She’d never ask Luo Zuishan himself when sending Gu Qishao would save her much more hassle. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qishao was clearly harbored ulterior motives when he grinned and said, “All right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s something else that’s also extremely urgent,” Han Yunxi said again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Gu Qishao was puzzled. What other problems could there be? Long Tianmo’s swollen stomach came from being planted with </span><i><span style>Gu, </span></i><span style>so the disappearance of that stomach didn’t come from a shift in illness, but a removal of the </span><i><span style>Gu. </span></i><span style>The poison in his joints had been treated as well, so it was a safe bet to say that Han Yunxi would beat Third Elder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Gu Qishao asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to meet a person, ideally by tomorrow. Help me find him,” Han Yunxi lowered her voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is it?” Gu Qishao was even more curious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Northern Li’s Duke of Kang, Jun Yixie,” Han Yunxi said truthfully. She didn’t know that Long Tianmo had been poisoned with </span><i><span style>Gu, </span></i><span style>much less that removing the </span><i><span style>Gu </span></i><span style>had gotten rid of his swollen stomach as well. She only knew that she had to ascertain three things in order to beat Third Elder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number one, Long Tianmo’s old ailment, which Luo Zuishan could tell her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number two, the disappearance of Long Tianmo’s swollen stomach, which Jun Yixie had to know since he was responsible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number three, the antidote to the Bone Poison in Long Tianmo’s body, which was also Jun Yixie’s work. He should have one handy. If he applied poison without an antidote, it was basically akin to murder. Jun Yixie shouldn’t have the guts, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking for him for?” Gu Qishao was completely lost now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s the chief instigator behind those Northern Li agents and the true poisons master,” Han Yunxi replied quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Gu Qishao narrowed his eyes with a dangerous light. “It was him!” </span><i><span style>In other words, Jun Yixie was a high level master of the Gu arts as well? </span></i><span style>This really went beyond his expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to see him as soon as possible,” Han Yunxi said earnestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qishao hid the dangerous glint in his eyes and teased, “Northern Li’s Duke of Kang is your husband’s mortal enemy. You said you want to see him, but does Long Feiye know?”</span></p>
