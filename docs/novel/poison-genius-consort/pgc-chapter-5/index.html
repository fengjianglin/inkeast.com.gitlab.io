 <p>Chapter 5: A familiar warning&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volaretranslations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skies had grown dark, but Han Yunxi was still fast asleep. Heaven knows how tired this body was. Despite this, she heard a familiar </span><i><span style>dootdootdoot, dootdootdoot</span></i><span style> from the depth of her consciousness. On instinct, she opened her eyes.</span><i><span style> Wasn't this noise the warning signal from Lingyun Hospital's newest detoxification system?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In an effort to keep her as an employee, Lingyun Hospital used vast amounts of funding to research and develop a poison-detection system. It was the equivalent of an intelligent pocket dimension where she could store antidote ingredients and equipment for her patients.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system had been implanted into the nerves of her brain and was completely controlled by her mind. Han Yunxi never thought her transmigrated soul would carry over such a treasure as well. She was moved. </span><i><span style>Heaven hadn't forgot about her!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>"doot" </span></i><span style>「嘟」alarm sounded like "</span><i><span style>du" </span></i><span style>「毒」, or poison. It was a reminder to Han Yunxi that there was poison within range around her. She had been suspecting whether the tumor on her face was created by toxic means. With the alert from the detox system, she was certain that was the case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Closing her eyes, she tried to use her mind to open the detoxification system. She didn't expect it to be just as easy to use as before. She took out a few acupuncture needles and some medical gauze from the contained dimension while checking over her supplies. There were still plenty of acupuncture needles and medicinal ingredients.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi then took a glance outside, seeing everyone else dozing around her. For the time being, she was certain she'd be undisturbed and started to treat the poison on her face. Originally, she wanted to collect and analyze some blood from the tumor in her detox system, until she recognized the poison with one whiff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This toxin was also known as grape clusters, or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style>staphylococcus</span></i></a><span style>, a commonplace poison used in ancient times to disfigure the face. Even poison experts with trifling abilities could dissolve the venom, yet the great medical family of Han had allowed its daughter to suffer without anyone treating her. She must have been poisoned on purpose!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han family, was it. She'd remember this grudge for the body's original owner. </span></p>
 <p><span style>There was logic in not letting a doctor self-treat oneself. Although removing poison was easy, it was inconvenient when the poison was on her own face. She could only grope around in the dark to bleed out the poisonous blood and clean its remnants, choosing and applying her own medicine. Finally, she stuck a piece of gauze to her face and finished up everything within an hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After cleaning up her things, Han Yunxi replaced the bridal veil on her head and called out, "Nanny Wang, I'm hungry. Bring me a bowl of noodles."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nanny Wang had been on guard all day. When the Duke of Qin's residence didn't sent people to chase them off, her gut recognized the formidable person within the carriage and dared not offend Han Yunxi anymore. Immediately, she ran off to buy food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A large bowl of delicious, steaming hot noodles was handed into the sedan chair, completely overtaking its previous scent of medicine. Han Yunxi dismissed Nanny Wang before removing her bridal veil and happily gorged herself on the fresh, hot noodles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Han Yunxi's chosen husband, Long Feiye, the Duke of Qin, stood with his hands clasped behind his back atop a nearby building. He leaned against a parapet as he observed the scene in the distance. His expression was impossible to discern, but his form was tall, dashing, and as lofty as a mountain. In his black robes, he looked both mysterious and imposing as he emitted an aura of domineering arrogance. From this height, he resembled a respected god of the night, disdainfully surveying&nbsp;the common people below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Duke, we've done thorough investigations. The woman inside the sedan chair truly is Han Yunxi. Nanny Wang is one of the grand concubine's people." a black-robed chamberlain respectfully reported.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What's the situation inside the imperial palace?" his voice was deep and chilly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The news has spread. Many are making private bets as to whether she'll pass through the gates tomorrow," replied his interior bodyguard, Chu Xifeng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Long Feiye turn around, his handsome face cold as if it was carved by the Heavens. Those looks could&nbsp;arouse the indignation of both men and gods, yet the lamp light shining on his face did nothing to illuminate those dark eyes. They were like icy pools with endless depths, an eternal riddle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your lordship[2] is also curious to see if she'll enter." Long Feiye said coldly before stepping into the air and leaving the Duke of Qin's residence behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Xifeng was stunned. Heavens, had he heard incorrectly? Even the Duke of Qin could be curious, and the object of interest was a woman?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was the sun going to rise from the west tomorrow?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-o-</span></p>
 <p><span style>[1] </span><i><span style>Chu Xifeng </span></i><span style>(楚西风) －bodyguard for the Duke of Qin (Long Feiye). </span><i><span style>Chu</span></i><span style> can mean "distinct, clear, pain, suffering," </span><i><span style>Xifeng </span></i><span style>is "west wind."</span></p>
