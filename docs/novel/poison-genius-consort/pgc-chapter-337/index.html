 <p>Chapter 337: Unexpected appearance of the Serpent Fruit&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil Thing didn’t dare to disturb Mama Yunxi anymore. It sat there quietly and watched her use her needles. A long, long time later, Mama Yunxi finally finished with her acupuncture treatment, but the gentleman still hadn’t woken up. Lil Thing’s pudgy paw rubbed at its face to wipe away its tears before it jumped off the bed and vanished like a streak of smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon enough, it came back with a huge haul of medicinal ingredients and dumped them at the gentleman’s side. Han Yunxi was resting by the bed when the commotion startled her. She was stunned to see that Lil Thing had hidden away so many precious medicinal ingredients. Moreover, one of them was the rarely-seen Serpent Fruit! That was a key ingredient for the antidote to Mute Granny’s poison! The specific growing conditions required for the fruit meant that there were at most three samples that existed on Cloud Realm Continent. She never expected Lil Thing to have one of them on hand. Despite her shock, Han Yunxi felt that this was still reasonable. Lil Thing had lived for countless years, so it might have hidden away the Serpent Fruit a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tired Han Yunxi picked up the Serpent Fruit, causing Lil Thing to stand on its hind legs and stare at her with wide eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil Thing, your pile of ingredients won’t be able to save Gu Beiyue now. We can only use them to nourish his body after he gets better, understand? This Serpent Fruit can’t nourish his body, but it can save someone else. I’ll keep it for now,” Han Yunxi explained gently, her voice a completely different tone from her previous anger. She had been impatient because she hated people disturbing her acupuncture sessions. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil Thing didn’t blame Mama Yunxi, but it didn’t understand what Mama Yunxi was saying. It assumed that the Serpent Fruit could be used to save the gentleman, so when it saw Han Yunxi slip the fruit into her sleeve, it grew unhappy. Lil Thing jumped on Han Yunxi’s arm and started scratching at her. Helpless, Han Yunxi could only take out the Serpent Fruit and shake her head at Gu Beiyue. When Lil Thing understood, it jumped off her arm resentfully to curl up by Gu Beiyue’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>put away these ingredients,” Han Yunxi said listlessly. Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>did as she was told, but Lil Thing didn’t even spare her a glance. It huddled up next to Gu Beiyue and nuzzled his hand with its head. Not being able to see the gentlemen’s smile again made it very sad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi had to furrow her eyebrows at the sight. Why did Lil Thing like Gu Beiyue so much? The little creature hadn’t been shy since their first meeting. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil Thing, don’t worry. His life isn’t in danger, he just needs time to get better,” Han Yunxi said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue really had been severely injured. He not only needed to recover his energy, but his lack of sleep as well. Perhaps losing consciousness was a good thing, but he still needed to replenish his food and liquids.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>the medicine’s getting cold. Let this old servant feed him,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>said in a low voice, her mood equally glum. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Xifeng walked in then and said, “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>Gui </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>losing her temper.” Gui </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>had been waiting for close to an hour. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let her keep waiting,” Han Yunxi said coldly. The empress dowager hadn’t been in a hurry when they were in the palace, so she wouldn’t be in a hurry now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A subordinate of His Highness Duke of Qin had nothing to fear. Chu Xifeng grinned and said, “Alright!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was about to go when Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>said, “Come over here and help support the patient.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was only her and esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>in the room, so Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was worried that her unobservant mistress would trespass the bounds of appropriate contact between men and women again. Fortunately, Gui </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>had been late to follow them out of the empress dowager’s palace, or else she might have spread all sorts of rumors after seeing Han Yunxi help up Gu Beiyue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Xifeng understood the meaning in Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>eye and sent a pageboy to deal with Gui </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>before coming over himself. Gu Beiyue was completely out of it, so it was very difficult to feed him medicine. Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>and Chu Xifeng fiddled for a while before forcing a few spoonfuls into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi had finally calmed down, but the sight of their feeding attempts agitated her all over again. “Let me do it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was about to grab the medicine out of Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>hands when the latter hastily dodged out of the way. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>keep calm! Don’t get impatient!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re clumsy beyond belief, let me feed him!” Han Yunxi said anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>didn’t dare. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>all patients are like this. This old servant has experience, so let me do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop wasting words! You barely gave him anything after all this time!” Han Yunxi roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Lil Thing hopped onto Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>arm and sucked up all of the medicine in her bowl. As the three humans watched, it jumped onto Gu Beiyue’s body and bent down to feed him with its mouth. Lil Thing fed Gu Beiyue very, very slowly, but not a single drop of medicine leaked from Gu Beiyue’s lips. Han Yunxi and her servants were stupefied by the sight. They never knew Lil Thing had skills like this, too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the medicine was all gone, an entire hour had passed. Lil Thing’s head felt completely stiff, but it was delighted upon seeing Gu Beiyue’s complexion recover somewhat. Then it scrambled up Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>arm again to ask for more medicine. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>quick. Pour some warm water into that bowl, then have the kitchens cook some thin rice gruel,” Han Yunxi ordered hastily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue needed medicine as well as food. Right now, he could only take in porridge. If he ate too much or too well, the results would only backfire. Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>immediately set off, with Lil Thing following her up to the door before it realized something was off and backtracking.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why should it follow her? It wanted to watch over the gentleman instead!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, everyone ended up watching over Gu Beiyue and completely ignoring Gui </span><i><span style>mama. </span></i><span style>Imperial Physician Chen was also left kneeling in the guest hall. The empress dowager waited and waited, even sending multiple people to urge Han Yunxi on, but she simply blocked them all with a single excuse. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi told the empress dowager’s servants, “Go back and tell Esteemed Empress Dowager that His Highness put away the Medicine Fan. </span><i><span style>Chenqie </span></i><span style>can’t find it, so we’ll have to wait until His Highness returns.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Truthfully speaking, Han Yunxi had brought the Medicine Fan with her on her trip to the palace. Currently, it was being stored in the very same room where Gu Beiyue was recovering. The empress dowager was so infuriated that she started smashing things left and right in the palace. If she knew this would happen earlier, she wouldn’t have let Han Yunxi leave at all. Unfortunately, few people possessed the power of hindsight in this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All she could do was let Gui </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>keep waiting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gui </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>waited until nightfall before Han Yunxi finally emerged. She quickly asked, “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>it’s already so late. His Highness still hasn’t returned yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi wore a helpless expression. “His Highness went out on a trip. It’ll take a few days before he returns. Didn’t I tell you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gui </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>had waited an entire day, so she had long lost her temper. At Han Yunxi’s words, her fury exploded. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>you did this on purpose!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impudence!” Han Yunxi said coldly. “You dare speak to this </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>with that tone of voice?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gui </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was very familiar with such words. After all, the empress dowager had quoted the same line to Han Yunxi at the Palace of Heaven and Earth. She immediately regretted her outburst. Unfortunately, it was already too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone come, take this audacious servant and drag her out. She’ll be punished with 50 canings!” Han Yunxi said coldly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When one hit a servant, one looked at their master first. Before the empress dowager could begin her nightmare, Han Yunxi was going to slap her old face!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>have mercy! Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>this servant was wrong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>this servant doesn’t dare to act like this again! I’m begging you, please have mercy on this servant! Just this once!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>… …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gui </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>cries followed her as she was dragged out of the hall. Eventually, her pleas turned into warnings. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>this old servant has served the empress dowager for over 30 years. If you dare touch a hair on this head…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she could finish, a pageboy struck her with a wooden plank, changing her cries into ones of pain. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhhh…!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the hall, Imperial Physician Chen trembled with terror from his kneeling position. He didn’t dare make a peep. The beatings left Gui </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>half dead before Han Yunxi threw out out of the estate with Imperial Physician Chen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>By dawn of the next day, news of the affair had spread throughout the capital. It raised an uproar just like last time, when the Duke of Qin had punished the emperor’s most favored Eunuch Xue. Although the news wasn’t as big as Eunuch Xue’s punishment, plenty of people still found out that Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>wasn’t someone easy to provoke. By the time news reached Long Feiye’s ears at the Tang Clan, he simply nodded in satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was a well-deserved beating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he also sent people to secretly tell Chu Xifeng to keep an eye on Gu Beiyue! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The empress dowager was so angry that she lost her breath. It took three cardiotonic pills before she recovered. She wished she could tear Han Yunxi to pieces, but the woman had sufficient reason to beat her servant, so there was no way for her to find fault. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the empress dowager ended up waiting for three entire days. Because she was preoccupied over this problem, her insomnia grew worse. Typically, it’d only take her half the night before she fell asleep, but she spent the next three days unable to sleep even after day broke. Although she was exhausted, she couldn’t fall asleep. The longer she lied down, the more her head ached, and yet she had no energy when she did sit up. It was agony to the extreme. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, on the fourth day, she couldn’t bear it anymore. “Someone come, prepare a carriage! I want to go to the Duke of Qin’s estate!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That hateful Han Yunxi. Does she really think the reigning empress dowager is so easy to bully? Wait ‘til I show her!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>And yet, the empress dowager hadn’t even left the palace when Han Yunxi arrived. She only wanted to make the empress dowager mad. How could she really wait until Long Feiye came back to give her the Medicine Fan? Everything had its own degrees. She had to pace herself when it came to tormenting this old thing, walking a fine line between leaving her hanging and completely pissing her off. More importantly, she had to give her the Medicine Fan. Otherwise, how could she make sure the empress dowager would have unending nightmares?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The empress dowager returned to her rooms as soon as she heard the eunuch announce Han Yunxi’s arrival. She sat on her warm couch and straightened out her robes, then adjusted her expression so she looked calm and unperturbed. In truth, she was rather surprised by Han Yunxi’s arrival. Still, she soon reasoned that it made sense because she was still the empress dowager while the other was only a </span><i><span style>wangfei. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, so she finally knew to came! I’ve been waiting!” the empress dowager said, before Han Yunxi entered the room. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As before, Han Yunxi appeared cool and indifferent, natural and at ease. “</span><i><span style>Chenqie </span></i><span style>pays greetings to Esteemed Empress Dowager. May Esteemed Empress Dowager be well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry and rise,” the empress dowager said with a loving smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of age, women competed with each other in the same things: ruthlessness, self-possession, and patience. Whoever could endure to the end would be the winner. As soon as Han Yunxi straightened up, the empress dowager had her sit down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought you wouldn’t come until the Duke of Qin returned!” said the empress dowager.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could I do that?” Han Yunxi smiled slightly. “Is Esteemed Empress Dowager doing better now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weren’t her words jabbing the empress dowager’s sore spot? The empress dowager’s heart burned with rage, but she kept her genial expression. “Much better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you slept well?” Han Yunxi looked concerned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hands hidden in the empress dowager’s sleeves balled into fists, but her expression was still affable. “Much better than the past few days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was very satisfied. “Then that’s good. Yunxi was organizing His Highness’s clothes last night when I came upon a certain something. Would Esteemed Empress Dowager like to guess what it is?” As Han Yunxi spoke, Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>stepped forward with an object wrapped in red cloth resting on a plate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The empress dowager knew that Han Yunxi had come to deliver her coveted Medicine Fan, but despite it being within arm’s reach, she was still excited. In the end, she was still human, after all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…” the empress dowager was moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Empress Dowager, have a look,” Han Yunxi said, still wearing a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The empress dowager impatiently lifted up the red cloth...</span></p>
