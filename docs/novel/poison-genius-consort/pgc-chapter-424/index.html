 <p>Chapter&nbsp;<span>424: Deliver the Buddha to the west</span>&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Baili Mingxiang was here!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>“Rejected,” Long Feiye replied coldly. He wouldn’t let anyone see Han Yunxi now because the woman had to rest. Being disturbed was the last thing she needed.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Your Highnesss, she came to look for </span><i><span>chenqie,” </span></i><span>&nbsp;Han Yunxi reminded helpfully.</span></p>
 <p><span>Long Feiye ignored her and told Zhao </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>in an icy tone, “</span><i><span>Wangfei </span></i><span>needs rest, so no meeting.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhao </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>didn’t know anything about the Beauty’s Blood, but she was aware of the Baili Clan’s loyalty to His Highness. She rather liked Miss Mingxiang herself. But since that was what her master had said, Zhao </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>could only obey. “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span>She was about to leave when Han Yunxi called out, “Hold it!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Zhao </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>felt laden with grief as she came to a stop in silence. Han Yunxi continued, “Your Highness, since Miss Mingxiang’s here already, it saves </span><i><span>chenqie </span></i><span>a trip. Her illness is very particular, so </span><i><span>chenqie </span></i><span>should examine her personally.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Long Feiye could only relent in the face of Han Yunxi’s serious gaze. He didn’t speak, but neither did he stop her. Han Yunxi signaled Zhao </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>with her eyes, and the old woman hurried to invite in their guest. She dearly wished to make a bet with Chu Xifeng right then to see which one of their masters would yield first in their future arguments.</span></p>
 <p><span>By the time Baili Mingxiang was led into the courtyard, Long Feiye and Han Yunxi were already sitting outside and drinking tea. Su Xiaoyu waited upon them both carefully. Baili Mingxiang was thin to begin with, but her recent trials had left her nearly skin and bones. If the wind was any stronger, it might have blown her right away. </span></p>
 <p><span>As soon as she entered, she fell to her knees. “Your Highness, esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei, </span></i><span>Mingxiang came to express her gratitude! Because of Mingxiang’s illness, Your Highness and esteemed</span><i><span> wangfei </span></i><span>have suffered exhaustion.”</span></p>
 <p><span>With the servants present, it wasn’t convenient for Baili Mingxiang to reference her condition directly. Few people knew about the Beauty’s Blood, after all. Long Feiye only paid attention to his tea. Despite Han Yunxi’s exhortations about his ruthlessness losing his followers, his personality couldn’t change. There were people in the world who held their own brand of charisma that attracted others to them. They didn’t have to make an effort to reach out and win hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Rise and come over here, have a seat. Let me take your pulse,” Han Yunxi was quite happy to see the woman she’d saved here. Although the detox system had yet to recover all its functions, she could still make a diagnosis with her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span>Long Feiye was sitting right next to Han Yunxi, so Baili Mingxiang didn’t dare get too close. She didn’t sit, but bent down to rest her arm on the table. Su Xiaoyu stole a peek at the woman. She knew this was a young Miss from the Baili Estate, but she didn’t pay her much mind. Her main motive for coming to the Duke of Qin’s estate was much more important.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You’ve fully recovered from your illness, but your body still needs care to reach full health!” Han Yunxi smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span>Baili Mingxiang stepped back before kneeling on the ground again. She looked at Han Yunxi with a strong, sincere gaze. This was probably the first time she’d completely ignored His Highness Duke of Qin’s presence to focus on somebody else. Her eyes right now held nothing but Han Yunxi, the woman who’d spent half a year figuring out how to save her, who’d tried so hard that she’d lost consciousness. She was the only person in the world who had wholeheartedly treated her well.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei, </span></i><span>Mingxiang’s life is yours now. Mingxiang said before that I’d serve </span><i><span>wangfei </span></i><span>for a lifetime if I survived!” Baili Mingxiang spoke, before kowtowing to the ground. </span></p>
 <p><span>In a flash, everyone looked over in amazement at the sight, including Long Feiye. Although the strength of the Baili Clan belonged to Long Feiye, Baili Mingxiang was still the wealthy daughter of a well-to-do family. </span><i><span>Be a servant for a lifetime? That was a bit too…</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Han Yunxi had known about this already and only felt helpless. “Alright, alright. If there’s anything you want to say, stand up and say it.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Baili Mingxiang not only insisted on staying down, but didn’t even lift her head from the ground. “Esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei, </span></i><span>please accept Mingxiang!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Han Yunxi didn’t want to, but she’d never figured out how to reject people. Her words were none too tactful as she said bluntly, “I don’t need you to serve me, so you don’t have to ask.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei, </span></i><span>Mingxiang is being sincere!” Baili Mingxiang said anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I’m being sincere too. I really don’t need anyone,” Han Yunxi might have accused Long Feiye of being heartless, but she was rather ruthless herself.</span></p>
 <p><span>Baili Mingxiang fell silent. Finally, she slowly raised her head and looked at Han Yunxi. “Esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei, </span></i><span>Mingxiang’s begging you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Han Yunxi was about to refuse again when she caught a hint of helplessness in Baili Mingxiang’s eyes. It didn’t seem like the girl was asking her to accept her gratitude, but pleading with her for help.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Could it be...there’s something else behind all this? </span></i><span>Han Yunxi glanced at Long Feiye before she probed, “Your Highness, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Baili Mingxiang was an exceptionally talented women well versed in scholarly knowledge and rites. She was intelligent as well and only slightly older than Han Yunxi, so it wasn’t impossible to take her as a servant. Moreover, she was definitely trustworthy---at least more so than Su Xiaoyu. If Han Yunxi really wanted a personal companion, she’d be a good choice.</span></p>
 <p><span>Long Feiye’s reply was mild. “It’s fine if you decide.”</span></p>
 <p><span>A mixture of emotions went through Baili Mingxiang’s heart at his words, but she grit her teeth and suppressed those feelings into the deepest part of her. Ever since getting her new lease on life, Baili Mingxiang had told herself she’d serve esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei </span></i><span>for a lifetime. If that was the case, she had to be clearer than ever to keep some feelings buried in her heart for eternity. Deep, deep down they’d go, in a place she’d never think about again. </span></p>
 <p><span>After getting Long Feiye’s opinion, Han Yunxi didn’t want to cause Baili Mingxiang any further difficulties. She privately wondered whether something was up at the Baili Estate. Hesitating slightly, she said, “You can stay for now, but I need time to think this over. I’ll give you an answer later.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Here was a concession! </span></i><span>Baili Mingxiang was delighter. “Thank you, esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei!</span></i><span>”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Now you can get up, right?” Han Yunxi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>A little embarrassed, Baili Mingxiang rose quickly to her feet. “Is esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei </span></i><span>doing better now?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Better now, it wasn’t anything serious.” Han Yunxi offered Baili Mingxiang a teacup and motioned her to sit as she poured in some tea. But how could Baili Mingxiang sit down when Long Feiye was still around? She remained standing.</span></p>
 <p><span>Long Feiye noticed that his own teacup was empty and knew that Han Yunxi was hinting at him to leave so she could speak to Baili Mingxiang. He wasn’t interested in women chatting anyways, so he only told Zhao </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>in a cold tone, “Wait on them.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Then he rose and left. </span></p>
 <p><span>Once he was gone, Han Yunxi laughed. “Baili Mingxiang, you can sit down and have a proper conversation now, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span>But Baili Mingxiang was quite cautious. She cast a glance at Zhao </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>and Su Xiaoyu before Han Yunxi got the hint and dismissed them.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Is your father making things difficult?” Han Yunxi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Baili Mingxiang smiled faintly. “Esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei </span></i><span>is indeed sharp.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“What happened?” Han Yunxi was bewildered. </span><i><span>Baili Mingxiang’s already cultivated the Beauty’s Blood. What else does her father want her to do?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>“Esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei, </span></i><span>Mingxiang didn’t come to you to seek refuge because of my father. Mingxiang truly wants to stay and serve by your side,” Baili Mingxiang had to make things clear. Han Yunxi didn’t care about all that. All she knew was that Baili Mingxiang couldn’t stay by her side for long. A girl as young as her would be caught by flights of fancy as soon as she saw someone she liked, after all. That was completely normal. She was quite blasé when it came to things like debts of gratitude.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Speak, what’s going on?” Han Yunxi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Father wants to arrange my marriage…” </span></p>
 <p><span>At that, Han Yunxi immediately understood. No girl from a well-established clan had a simple marriage. She waved a hand to stop Baili Mingxiang before the woman could explain any further. “How’s this? I can keep you here, but if you ever meet someone you want to marry one day, you mustn’t hide the fact from me.”</span></p>
 <p><span>After some thought, Han Yunxi added, “You can just be my assistant and help with getting ingredients and making prescriptions. You can also look after the poison plants in the garden, but there’s no need to do anything else.”</span></p>
 <p><span>In the end, Baili Mingxiang was still from a prominent clan. How could she do servants’ work well? But after taking poisons for so many years, she should be more sensitive to toxic substances in general. Han Yunxi suddenly realized that she’d grown kinder. Perhaps she and Baili Mingxiang were tied together by fate. This could be counted as delivering the Buddha to the west---helping someone to the very end.</span></p>
 <p><span>Baili Mingxiang was so moved that she didn’t know what to say. She wanted to kneel again, but Han Yunxi quickly caught her. “Don’t, don’t! Go back and take care of your body first. Find me again after a month, and leave General Baili to me. I’ll tell His Highness about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Baili Mingxiang only nodded repeatedly. “Esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei, </span></i><span>I… I….” She felt like she had to say something, but she couldn’t find the right words to express her heartfelt feelings. Before she left, she suddenly realized that there was something important she had to do.</span></p>
 <p><span>She carefully took a small porcelain box out of her sleeve. “Esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei, </span></i><span>this is a specialty medicinal plant from the Baili Clan, taken from the edges of the deepest sea trenches. Its nourishing properties far exceed that of any other medicine. I ask that you kindly accept this.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span>A medicinal plant from the deepest sea trenches?</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Han Yunxi was puzzled. This was the first time she’d heard of any medicinal plant coming from a sea trench. She opened the box and found it filled with water. Soaking in the center was a lush green plant. Apart from its pocket-sized sample, it looked no different than ordinary seagrasses.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What’s this called?” Han Yunxi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Elegant Fishy Grass. All you need to do is fry it in plain water once in the morning, noon and night. After it’s been fried for the third time, it’ll naturally dissolve into the liquid. Anyone who takes this thrice will recover quickly no matter how weak they all. Please make sure to take it, esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei.</span></i><span>”</span></p>
 <p><span>Baili Mingxiang seemed worried that Han Yunxi wouldn’t eat the grass and made sure to emphasize its healing properties again.</span></p>
 <p><span>“If it’s that miraculous, why don’t you eat it yourself?” Han Yunxi smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I only started eating mine today. I drank a bowl’s worth, but I’ll be going back for another dose,” Baili Mingxiang said lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Han Yunxi thus accepted the plant. She had no idea that the Elegant Fishy Grass was the most precious treasure of the Mermaid Clan. Only one would grow every 1,000 years. When Baili Yuanlong had gotten the plant in the past, he’d given it directly to Long Feiye’s mother, who’d given it to a young Baili Mingxiang because her body was too weak to stand against the poisons. It was supposed to help bolster the girl’s health, but Baili Mingxiang was too reluctant to eat it herself. She’d hidden the treasure away for a decade before simply handing it over to Han Yunxi with a made-up story.</span></p>
 <p><span>Fortunately, Han Yunxi was genuinely curious about the taste of the grass, so as soon as Baili Mingxiang left, she summoned Zhao </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>to pass her the box. “Fry it with plain water three times in one day.”</span></p>
 <p><span>After eating the grass, Han Yunxi not only recovered her energy, but increased her vitality as well. Her detox system immediately resumed its normal operations. </span></p>
 <p><span>“Esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei, </span></i><span>this medicine is certainly effective,” Zhao </span><i><span>mama </span></i><span>even felt that esteemed </span><i><span>wangfei’s </span></i><span>cheeks looked ruddier than before.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s such a good item. I should snag one for Lil Thing in the future,” Han Yunxi joked. </span></p>
 <p><span>Heaven knows what kind of excuses Baili Mingxiang would have to make if Han Yunxi asked for another grass in the future...</span></p>
