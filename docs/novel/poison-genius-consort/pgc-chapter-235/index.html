 <p>Chapter 235: Chaos, the real and fake crown prince&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Qinwang </span></i><span style>Rong was the first to greet the elders upon news of their arrival. If the positions of these medical academy elders were placed in a monarchy instead, then they’d be high-ranking officials a step down from princes who were superior to all but the emperor. Han Yunxi harbored a cold smile in her heart. Long Feiye had been right; Emperor Tianhui didn’t really have the guts to threaten Medical City. When Long Tianmo had been missing, the emperor had demanded an explanation from Medical City, but now that he’d inexplicably resurfaced, the proud </span><i><span style>Qinwang </span></i><span style>Rong had condescended to bend his will without any words from the city at all. Still, if she gave it careful thought, she realized that </span><i><span style>Qinrang </span></i><span style>Rong didn’t lack backbone. It was just that Medical City’s might was too terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cloud Realm Medical Academy and Medicine City’s three great clans controlled all of Cloud Realm Continent’s medical trade. They had complete power over the life of any doctor. In other words, these two powers were capable of controlling all lives under Heaven! A single bout of illness could take your life, regardless of whether you were a high and mighty emperor or some low and humble slave. A single pestilence could destroy a battalion of soldiers, an entire city, or even the whole country. If any of the three empires in Cloud Realm Continent could draw on Medical City and Medicine City’s powers, then their might would surpass that of the other two to become the true hegemon of Cloud Realm Continent. Looking at it from a different angle, anyone who offended Medical or Medicine City stood to gain unthinkable consequences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were a total of five Elders at the medical academy; three had come this time. Han Yunxi’s impression of such elders was that they should be old but hale and hearty, white-haired and ruddy-faced. Perhaps they'd give off a celestial air like ancient daoists. However, of the two men and one woman who showed up, only one of them was advanced in years. The remaining man and woman looked to be in their middle age. The eldest had white hair and whiskers, with kindly eyebrows that made him resemble an agreeable old immortal; the middle-aged man had a stern face that didn't lend itself to smiles, while the middle-aged woman was dressed impeccably, with beautiful features that marked her as a formidable female with one look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are there Elders even younger than the directors?” Han Yunxi asked in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That old man there is Third Elder Shen Jueming[1. </span><i><span style>Shen Jueming </span></i><span style>(沈决明) - </span><i><span style>Shen </span></i><span style>is a surname that can also be read as </span><i><span style>Chen, </span></i><span style>which means “deep, profound, heavy, to sink.” </span><i><span style>Jueming </span></i><span style>means “cassia” in botany; the words themselves means “to determine” and “bright, brilliance, clear,” respectively.], one of the three Sage Doctors of the medical academy. Of the other two, one is Fourth Elder Li Tianci[2. </span><i><span style>Li Tianci</span></i><span style> (李天赐) - </span><i><span style>Li </span></i><span style>is a surname that also means “plum.” </span><i><span style>Tianci </span></i><span style>means “be bestowed by Heaven.” ], a Primogenitor Doctor like the two directors, and Fifth Elder Lady Lianxin[3. </span><i><span style>Lady Lianxin</span></i><span style> (怜心夫人) - </span><i><span style>Lian </span></i><span style>means “sympathize with, pity, love,” and </span><i><span style>Xin </span></i><span style>means “heart.” ]…” Gu Beiyue’s voice grew softer once he reached this point. “Lady Lianxin is a Divine Doctor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were two major systems in place at the medical academy. One was the administration system, which had different levels amongst the directors, Council of Elders, Vice-Council courtyard and various department heads. The other was the medical skills system, which applied to all doctors across Cloud Realm Continent. From lowest to highest, there was Medical Apprentice, Medical Scholar, Medical Adept, Grand Medical Adept, Divine Doctor, Primogenitor Doctor, Sage Doctor, Empyreal Doctor and Sovereign Doctor. Luo Zuishan and Xi Yubo were both identically ranked Primogenitor Doctors who were directors in the administration system. Gu Beiyue’s skills were equal to that of a Divine Doctor, but he'd yet to join up with the medical academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Typically speaking, higher medical skills led to more authority, but the Council of Elders actually had a Divine Doctor amongst its staff. It seemed like skills weren't the only things pulling weight at the medical academy and that this Lady Lianxin was an exceptional existence. When Han Yunxi saw Lady Lianxin, she couldn't help but think of Han Congan. As a Divine Doctor, he'd somehow become a director as well. This was the exception that Lady Tianxin had given him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what kind of exceptions were permitted in the medical academy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How come she can be part of the Council of Elders?” Han Yunxi hastened to ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That, I don’t know. I just know she’s a daughter of the Mu Clan in Medicine City,” Gu Beiyue said honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi digested the information with interest. Long Feiye depended on Medicine City’s Wang Clan and could probably investigate a lot about the medical academy. It seems like the upper tiers of the academy still gave face to the three great clans of Medicine City. Besides those three, who else did the medical academy give face to? Could Lady Tianxin have come from Medicine City too? Han Yunxi’s thoughts wandered away before Lady Lianxin looked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re Lady Tianxin and Han Congan’s daughter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Very surprised, Han Yunxi replied, “That would be this junior! Fifth Elder knows my mother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Lady Lianxin only replied arrogantly, “I’ve heard of her, that’s all.” She didn’t plan to continue the topic, but went straight to the point to explain the particulars of the consultation in a concise and comprehensive manner. This time’s public consultation would take place in the Elders’ Hall with the three of them taking part. Luo Zuishan and Xi Yubo could only act as observers. If there were any points of doubt, they could discuss them after the consultation was over. Lady Lianxin might’ve been the lowest-ranked elder, but she was the one most in charge. The other two elders didn’t even bother to open their mouths. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tianning’s crown prince is already in the consultation hall. Ladies and gentlemen, please proceed.” Lady Lianxin turned around as soon as she finished speaking. The other two elders and </span><i><span style>Qinwang </span></i><span style>Rong all stood up simultaneously, but none of the others present had the intention to proceed. Everyone knew that Long Tianmo’s swollen stomach had disappeared. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi and Gu Beiyue had talked this over in length just then. They couldn’t make heads or tails of Long Tianmo’s “chronic ailment” to begin with. Now they hadn’t even gotten to see the patient or feel his pulse, making it impossible to figure him out. The two of them stared at Luo Zuishan, hoping to see his previous self-confidence on that face. Unfortunately, Luo Zuishan had lost his self-assurance and only had furrowed eyebrows, his heart heavy. As for Xi Yubo, his head was bowed and his entire person seemed swathed in dim shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xi, go on,” </span><i><span style>Qinwang </span></i><span style>Rong urged in a low voice. He could tell that Xi Yubo was restless. Last night, he’d gone with him to see Long Tianmo’s stomach and asked about the crown prince’s condition. Had he recovered, or had the nature of the illness changed? Xi Yubo hadn’t given him a straight answer. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xi Yubo darted a glance at </span><i><span style>Qinwang </span></i><span style>Rong. He seemed to want to say something, but held back when he saw that </span><i><span style>Qinwang </span></i><span style>Rong had no complaints. The three elders and </span><i><span style>Qinwang </span></i><span style>Rong remained standing while everyone else was still sitting. Silence pervaded the room as the atmosphere suddenly turned odd. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, do the two directors have other matters?” Lady Lianxin asked with creased eyebrows. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Zuishan was about to speak when Xi Yubo opened his mouth at the same time. “Fifth Elder…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they heard each other’s voices, both of them fell silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what is going on?” Lady Lianxin was an impatient type, but the other two elders had sat back down. Xi Yubo looked at Luo Zuishan, who looked back at him. Both of them harbored sinister intentions but refused to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Luo, you were the one who brought up this consultation. If there’s anything to say, you say it first,” Lady Lianxin commanded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Zuishan’s heart was filled with grievances.</span><i><span style> It wasn’t him who asked for this, all right?</span></i><span style> He was forced! Gu Qishao said that this Long Tianmo was a fake, so he had to be fake. Using a false Long Tianmo to do a public consultation would lead to a big mess, Heaven knows </span><i><span style>how</span></i><span style> big! Leaving aside the ramifications and the fact that </span><i><span style>Gu </span></i><span style>was involved, a public consultation like this could damage the medical academy’s good name. As the person who brought up the idea, he wouldn’t escape responsibility, either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was already astonished to see Luo Zuishan’s hesitation. It looked like Long Tianmo’s illness had exceeded Luo Zuishan’s control and that Xi Yubo was about to win. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Luo Zuishan!” Lady Lianxin said crossly. Though she was 30 years younger and less medically skilled than the man, her status was still there. Her anger still gave Luo Zuishan a fright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These three elders, let’s delay the consultation. I suspect that the Tianning crown prince is a fake,” Luo Zuishan finally spoke up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was startled by his words, </span><i><span style>Qinwang </span></i><span style>Rong the most of all. He grew anxious. “How could this be? Why do you say so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi looked at Gu Beiyue in disbelief. He was looking back as well, and the two of them grew even more confused. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Luo Zuishan, what do you mean by your words?” the ever silent Third Elder finally spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The stomach...just, just judging by the Tianning crown prince’s illness, it’s impossible for his stomach to recede within these few days,” Luo Zuishan explained hesitantly. As long as he exposed the matter of using </span><i><span style>Gu, </span></i><span style>the three elder would definitely believe him, but he couldn’t do such a thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First off, the real Long Tianmo wasn’t present, so he had no evidence. Secondly, he didn’t dare say it in public. Although his explanation lacked confidence, it was still reasonable under the circumstances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A fake?” Han Yunxi began to think it over carefully. Long Feiye had reminded her that Jun Yixie would interfere. Perhaps Jun Yixie had switched the real Long Tianmo for a replacement instead of doing something to him personally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As this old man sees it, whether or not the Tianning crown prince’s stomach could recede so quickly should be a question left for discussion at the consultation,” Third Elder said as he glanced at Xi Yubo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Logically speaking, Xi Yubo should step forward and rebut Luo Zuishan’s claims. When it came to Long Tianmo’s stomach, he had more right to speak. But right now, Xi Yubo was extremely quiet. It was a silence that stretched beyond the surface to turn him restless in the very depths of his heart. Why was Luo Zuishan so certain that this Long Tianmo was a fake? Did Luo Zuishan know he had used </span><i><span style>Gu?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Impossible, </span></i><span style>Luo Zuishan knew of the </span><i><span style>Gu </span></i><span style>arts, but definitely not how to use them. Nor could he tell just by looking. He had learned his own </span><i><span style>Gu </span></i><span style>arts through a lucky chance, and only a bit from secret studies. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The three elders finally lost their patience when they saw Xi Yubo refuse to answer. “Someone come, arrange for the consultation immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At these words, Xi Yubo finally sprang up from his seat. “Not so fast! I suspect that this Tianning crown prince is a fake replacement as well. Director Luo’s words are reasonable. There’s no way that the Tianning crown prince’s stomach could recede in such a short time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from a high level </span><i><span style>Gu </span></i><span style>master, no one else could remove </span><i><span style>Gu </span></i><span style>planted in a person. His own </span><i><span style>Gu </span></i><span style>was nearly impossible to remove by anyone other than himself. Rather than believe there were still expert </span><i><span style>Gu </span></i><span style>masters in this world, he’d rather believe that the Long Tianmo in the consultation hall right now was a sham.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could he formulate a successful strategy for the consultation of a fake crown prince? Heavens knows if Han Yunxi and the rest had acted out a play to get this fake for the consultation? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xi Yubo’s words surprised everyone present. </span><i><span style>Could it be that this Long Tianmo really was a fake?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How could he be a fake? That’s clearly Mo’er!” </span><i><span style>Qinwang </span></i><span style>Rong didn’t believe it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Prudence first. Why don’t we delay the consultation until later?” Xi Yubo suggested. It was rare for him to stand on the same side as Luo Zuishan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do we tell if he’s real or a fake?” Han Yunxi asked quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue could only shake his head. Real or fake, these matters had completely gone out of control. </span><i><span style>Should they delay the consultation? Was this the truth, or a sham?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As everyone stared at each other in silence, a young medical assistant ran over to report, “Three elders, the Tianning crown prince has woken up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a prolonged coma, Long Tianmo was finally awake…</span></p>
