 <p><span style>Chapter 136: Look quickly, something's happened</span>&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No poison! The results of the scan showed no poison!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi sucked in a cold breath, staring in dismay at the tea leaves. Cold sweat broke out on her back.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No poison! There actually wasn’t any poison!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody present had any idea what she just did. All they saw was her staring at the tea leaves with a rather ghastly expression. Madame Li was the first to cause difficulties. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>are you going to test for poison now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi raised her eyes to see Madame Li’s eyes flicker with a sneer. She’d done it on purpose just so she could see Han Yunxi’s reaction. Madame Li had to be the real culprit, but these tea leaves…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>hurry and test them!” Han Ruoxue urged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Liuyue wasn’t so patient and said coldly, “Han Yunxi, speak! Why aren’t you saying anything? What, all those nice words and you’re withering up when it’s time to test for poison? You’re just scaring people! Or else, making fools of them? Let me tell you, you might be Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>but if you don’t get any results today, this young Miss will go straight to the empress dowager and accuse you of framing others!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing the words </span><i><span style>‘empress dowager’ </span></i><span style>instantly put Grand Concubine Yi in a bad mood. She angrily demanded, “Han Yunxi, what’s wrong with you? Are you testing them or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi looked at them all with knitted eyebrows. By her side, Mu Qingwu and Chu Xifeng were as anxious as ants on a hot pan. Although neither of them understood what esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>had done, they could tell by her expression that maybe...maybe she knew the tea leaves had no poison.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Aiya, </span></i><span style>they’d told her long beforehand, but why didn’t she believe them? Now what should they do? </span><i><span style>She who rides a tiger finds it difficult to dismount!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, someone cried out from the crowd. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>please test for poison to prevent maligning a good person!” Soon afterwards, many more echoed his words in unison.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Esteemed wangfei, please test for poison to prevent maligning a good person!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Undoubtedly, Han Yunxi had become a target of public criticism. She gritted her teeth. Everyone thought that she was out of options, but it wasn’t a second before she coolly gave out an order. “Someone, bring hot water to steep these tea leaves! This </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>will test for poisons now for everyone to see!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps her scanners didn’t pick up any poisons because there was none there. But another possibility was that Madame Li’s techniques were too wily for the detox system to untangle. She faintly recalled reading in an ancient text a certain method for testing for Ten-Thousand Snake Poison. No matter how little of the poison there was, it would still reveal the poison. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten-Thousand Snake Poison didn’t exist in the present, so she’d never had a chance to try out the method. Even now, she wasn’t sure whether it’d work, but she didn’t have time to worry about all that. This was her only choice now that she had no others, so she could only brace herself and go forward. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she was putting her all into the fight, she might as well fight to the end!</span></p>
 <p><span style>From an outsider’s perspective, steeping the tea was simply a pretense to find a person to drink it. This was a simple way to test for poison, because the results would reveal the toxin. Everyone grew nervous at the thought. Meanwhile, Madame Li hid a cold smile in her heart. Of course she knew that Han Yunxi wouldn’t be so stupid to try such a simple method. Han Yunxi was the one who saved Mu Qingwu; she should understand that Ten-Thousand Snake Poison wouldn’t break out in the body until years afterwards. She figured that Han Yunxi had some sort of secret weapon, perhaps a formidable poison testing needle or poison stone, to test the tea for poison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as a poison didn’t enter the body, even small quantities could be detected with poison tools. But her poisons were different than that! Even the world’s strongest poison detecting stone wouldn’t be able to pinpoint her Ten-Thousand Snake Poison! Madame Li’s lips curved in disdain as she waited patiently. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Very soon, an attendant arrived with hot water on a tea tray, but Han Yunxi soon said, “I don’t want a teacup, but a large bowl.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Large bowl? What did she want that for?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The onlookers had no idea. Madame Li’s ridicule grew. She wasn’t planning to use a big bowl of tea to strengthen the concentration of poison, was she? Such a stupid method! It looks like her master wasn’t the only one to overestimate this woman. She’d overestimated her as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attendant immediately switched in a large bowl and steeped it full of tea leaves before setting it on a portable table. Everyone looked over, awaiting Han Yunxi’s next step. Would she find someone to drink the tea, or use a poison detecting stone in its depths?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, Han Yunxi spoke again. “Someone, catch a goldfish for me. I want a live one!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn’t using a person or a tool, but a goldfish?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the logic behind testing poisons was the same. Madame Li remained as calm as before. Goldish had much lower immunity than human beings, but so what? Han Yunxi would still be disappointed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon enough, the attendant brought over a lively, jumping goldfish before the expectant gazes of the impatient crowd. Han Yunxi accepted the fish and walked to the bowl of tea before taking another deep breath. She knew that everyone was anxious right now, but she was more anxious than any of them. Whether or not the ancient texts had told her the truth, whether or not this would yield any results, her very fate itself, all relied on this one fell swoop. As soon as she released this fish, everything would reach its final conclusion!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Either the fish was struggling too much, or her hands were trembling too hard. She couldn’t control either as she lowered her fingers, steeled her heart, and placed the fish into the tea water. Countless eyes flocked towards the creature, Han Yunxi amongst them. She saw the fish fleeing wildly into the water at the same time she caught her own ashen reflection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fish swam…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Would it be poisoned? Would it die?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone looked on with rapt attention. Even Mu Qingwu and Chu Xifeng temporarily forgot about taking precautions against Madame Li as they peered towards the water. Grand Concubine Yi was also staring and waiting. Han Yunxi’s heart was beating like a drum: </span><i><span style>thumpthumpthump, thumpthumpthump, </span></i><span style>as she followed the path of the swimming fish. Her heartbeat grew quicker and quicker, almost to the point where it was uncomfortable to breathe. Time trickled by as the fish swam and rested by degrees, seemingly completely normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Li’s lips rose into a mocking smile. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>exactly how long will you experiment before we get results?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I estimate until daybreak? Hehe,” Mu Liuyue smiled as well. So much time had passed. If there was really poison, the goldfish would be long dead by now. There was nothing in the tea leaves to start, Han Yunxi had told a massive lie!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Aiya, </span></i><span style>this is tea water. If we really waited ‘til daybreak, the fish might not live that long,” Han Ruoxue felt relieved of a heavy load as she reminded with a laugh. Tea wasn’t clear water, after all. A goldfish could only stay in it for four to six hours before it died from natural causes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi gritted her teeth, ignoring them all as she kept staring at the fish. She didn’t even notice that her forehead had long broken out into cold sweat. Enough time had passed to drink half a cup of tea, but the goldfish was still alive. </span><i><span style>Had the ancient texts been falsified?</span></i><span style> Was she doomed to fall into these women’s hands today?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, you should announce the results of the poison examination now!” Grand Concubine Yi reminded her coldly. She couldn’t wait to see Han Yunxi honor the terms of the bet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Han Yunxi kept her head down and didn’t reply. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Liuyue gave a chortle. “</span><i><span style>Aiya, </span></i><span style>it’s just a bet after all. If you agreed to bet, you must be prepared to lose. It’s no fun if you drag this out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi! Are you listening or not? I’m ordering you!” Grand Concubine Yi said sternly. She didn’t want to waste any more time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The goldfish was swimming so happily in the tea. Han Yunxi looked and looked before finally shutting her eyes. Slowly, very slowly, she lifted her head. When the crowd saw, they couldn’t help but gloat over her misfortune as they broke into ridicule.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Chu Xifeng gave out a cry. “Something’s happened! Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>look quickly, something’s happened!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Something’s happened?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi’s eyes flew open as she lowered her head, only to see...only to see the fish still swimming, but not as balanced as before. Many times, it kept flopping on its side. </span><i><span style>This was an omen of it going belly-up and dying!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi’s heart wouldn’t stop pounding as if it was going to burst out of her chest. There was hope! Hope! Her hand hovered excitedly over her chest. She didn’t even dare to blink as she stared rigidly at the goldfish. At the time time, the amazed crowd had turned back to look as well. Even Madame Li, as self-confident as she was, could only look back in disbelief as she shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could this be? </span></i><span style>She didn’t believe it. She wouldn’t. The goldfish couldn’t die. It wouldn’t!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But very quickly, the goldfish stopped moving to float in the water. Again and again it flopped on its side, as if fighting its last rounds with the god of death. Unfortunately, only a few bouts had passed before it completely turned over, its white belly protruding the surface of the water. Soon after that, tiny black dots revealed itself on its white stomach, growing in number and density until the entire fish’s belly had turned black.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heavens!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, all of the spectators sucked in a cold breath. The goldfish had not only died, but turned black. This was poison! Even Han Yunxi hadn’t expected such results. After all, she wasn’t even sure if this would work. Back then, she had really been frightened by failure. Right now her heart was still beating wildly, unable to calm itself down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, she wouldn’t forget proper protocol. As long as the poison showed itself, it was a simple matter of course to diagnose it. She quickly took out an acupuncture needle and collected a sample of blood from the fish’s belly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who will come test this poison?” she asked loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From within the crowd, a voice replied, “I will!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A old man walked forward, carefully examining the fish belly before touching the poisoned blood with his finger. After a few sniffs, he was convinced. “This is snake poison, a combination of many different snake venoms, the so-called Ten-Thousand Snake Poison!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really was a master amongst the common people!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi rejoiced. “I’m sure everyone saw clearly with their own eyes. This tea has poison, the same Ten-Thousand Snake Poison that afflicted the young general!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At these words, the onlookers slowly recovered from their shock to discuss amongst themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavens, if you drank this daily over the course of years, you’d end up like that fish one day…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too frightful, these methods are so sinister! Detestable!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Madame Li and her daughter are the true culprits! That’s horrific! I never imagined!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>… …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cries of alarm rose on all sides. Madame Li stood at a distance. Her poison skills were superb, but she never expected a trivial goldfish could expose her skills. She prized her poisoning techniques above all, but now her calm and unhurried facade had been thoroughly broken. Everything about her had been denied and exposed. Though she didn’t want to believe it, she couldn’t say anything against the results. Nor did she have any other choice but to accept them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Ruoxue stared dazedly at the goldfish. From beginning to end, she never believed that her own mother would put poison in the tea leaves. </span><i><span style>Had her mother been using her to poison the young general ever since the start?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Mother, you…” Han Ruoxue hadn’t even confronted her mother before Mu Liuyue suddenly swooped over to grab her by the hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Slut! You actually dared do such a thing! So much for me trusting you, you slut! I’m going to kill you!” Mu Liuyue was as angry as a wild beast as she threw herself at Han Ruoxue and hauled her by the hair.</span></p>
