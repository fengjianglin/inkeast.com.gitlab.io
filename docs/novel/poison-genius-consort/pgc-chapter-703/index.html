 <p style="text-align: left;">Chapter <span style>703: My life is up to me, not the Heavens&nbsp;</span><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Although Long Feiye’s appearance was sudden, Gu Beiyue didn’t startle. He stood up to pay obeisance, his tone gentle and modest. “Your Highness Duke of Qin, you must have business to visit so late at night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You believe in Buddha? What are you praying for?” Long Feiye asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m praying…” Gu Beiyue paused, before he said teasingly, “For my reincarnation into the next lifetime.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You haven’t finished this life yet, so why the rush to wish for the next?” Long Feiye asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue just smiled. “The Buddha says, suffering in this lifetime will be relieved by the next. That’s why we must endure past our pains.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye laughed coldly. “You believe in such ignorant truths?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This one believes not in Buddha, but in fate.” Gu Beiyue was ever smiling even at the most caustic remarks. If there was another life, he hoped that the Gu Clan would have nothing to do with the Shadow Clan ever again. Let him be himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness, do you trust in fate?” he asked lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fate?” Long Feiye just scoffed at the word. “My life is up to me, not the Heavens. Your lordship doesn’t believe in anything but myself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he trusted himself to fate and followed its whims, then what of Han Yunxi? East Qin was </span><i><span style>not </span></i><span style>his life, but Han Yunxi </span><i><span style>was!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your lordship will leave South Ning tomorrow,” he announced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If there’s anything this one can do, may Your Highness instruct me,” Gu Beiyue said seriously. Han Yunxi had left him with many tasks, so he knew that Long Feiye would do the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Long Feiye didn’t give him any instructions besides one thing. “If your lordship hasn’t descended the mountain by mid-autumn, protect Han Yunxi in my place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue’s peaceful heart gave a harsh, painful jolt at the words. He didn’t want to believe in fate, but everything revolved around it! No matter how much his heart ached, he remained coolly calm. No matter how much he lived in pain, he kept his slight smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness Duke of Qin, what do you mean by ‘protect?’ I am more of a cripple now than anything and need Guard Chu’s protection. I’m afraid I cannot shoulder Your Highness’s instructions,” he replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can shoulder it as long as she trusts you,” Long Feiye was certain. “All you have to do is protect her. Don’t let her leave South Ning, but wait for your lordship’s return.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue understood. During the mid-autumn season, the three nations at war would be hungering for grain. The commander-in-chief’s estate in South Ning would definitely make a big move. If Long Feiye couldn’t get back in time, Han Yunxi would try to take on the responsibilities all by herself. She might not even balk at charging into enemy lines. It sounded simple to keep Han Yunxi in South Ning, but it would take constant coaxing to make her stay, and to assist her in controlling the Cloud Realm Continent chessboard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>South Ning’s commander-in-chief’s estate suffered no lack of wealth and military strength. They only needed Long Feiye to accept and join them, and to pick an advisor to lead them. Without a doubt, both he and Han Yunxi had chosen Gu Beiyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue didn’t hesitate. “This one--this one won’t shrink from his duty! But I hope that things go smoothly for Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue had a good idea of the Celestial Mountain chessboard as well. He knew many things, but he kept them all to himself without revealing the details. Long Feiye simply nodded at his words and turned to leave. This was simply a precaution. Once the struggle at Celestial Mountain started, he had to find a way to finish it and leave before mid-autumn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Han Yunxi had just left Pill Fiend Pharmacy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, just take me with you. I promise I’ll be good and listen to your words,” Su Xiaoyu had been begging her from the building to here. Baili Mingxiang had only told Han Yunxi to </span><i><span style>‘take care’ </span></i><span style>without adding anything else. Han Yunxi was too lazy to acknowledge Su Xiaoyu now and simply cut her off with a wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, Little Yu’er is begging you. Master…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s with this racket? The newly arrived ingredients are all the best of the best. Hurry up and store them,” Mu Linger said as she snagged Su Xiaoyu by her collar and dragged her aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Poor Su Xiaoyu only gave Han Yunxi a pleading glance, but the woman replied, “Doctor Gu doesn’t have any free time right now, so you and Baili Mingxiang should stay behind to help out at Pill Fiend Pharmacy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Baili Mingxiang respectfully bowed her head. With no other choice, Su Xiaoyu simply muttered out a helpless </span><i><span style>‘oh.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After Han Yunxi left, Mu Linger personally dragged Su Xiaoyu into the buildings. Unfortunately, it wasn’t long before the girl secretly slipped away while the other was distracted and went to chase after Han Yunxi’s carriage. But as the carriage went faster and faster, it was impossible for her to keep up. She didn’t dare chase it all the way to the Duke of Qin’s estate since she feared that man the most. If His Highness Duke of Qin knew she was pestering esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>the consequences would be unthinkable. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Completely dejected, Su Xiaoyu hung her head and began to retrace her steps, only to catch sight of a familiar figure nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lady Helian?” she muttered doubtfully. When she looked closer, the figure suddenly vanished into an alleyway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s she going this late at night?” Su Xiaoyu immediately gave chase, but she didn’t see any sign of the woman even at the end of the lane.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did she go?” She raised her head to look at the surrounding roofs before finally leaning against her shoulder to rest. “Did she fly up onto the roofs? Can she fly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Su Xiaoyu flew up to check herself. Unfortunately, there was no sign of anyone around. She sat there for awhile in bewilderment. “Did I see the wrong person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she quickly dismissed her doubts. “It was definitely her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And yet, further thinking left her puzzled again. “Wasn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, she grew annoyed and decided to visit the Han Estate sometime. If she asked Lady Helian in person, she’ll find out whether she was mistaken--or whether the woman was hiding something. In fact, she already knew which method she’d use for interrogation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Late at night, the streets were silent as if the entire world had fallen into a dream. As the lamps of the Leisurely Cloud Pavilion lit up, Han Yunxi was framed in the windowsill. She’d almost forgotten how long it had been since she stood here last to stare at Long Feiye’s quarters in the distance. As before, his lamps were lit. Addicted to the spot, she poured herself a cup of tea and simply leaned against the window frame to stare. The skies were filled with stars and the breath of summer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye hadn’t gone to bed, but was still in his study. The </span><i><span style>Annals of the Seven Noble Families </span></i><span style>was resting on his desk, open to the page on the Wind Clan. A single ebony wood bookmark marked his place. He sat in his chair while leaning back, his long legs resting on the windowsill as his hands pillowed his head. From this angle, he could just see Han Yunxi figure in her window. This was a secret even Han Yunxi didn’t know. Of course, she knew even less about the countless nights that Long Feiye had sat staring at her in the dark with his lights off while pondering her origins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Chu Xifeng knew that His Highness Duke of Qin, despite rarely frequenting the estate, had come back daily these nights. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Han Yunxi, how long did it take you to like Long Feiye? He spent countless sleepless nights before he liked you…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Eventually, Han Yunxi hit the bed and went immediately to sleep. In her dreams, she could faintly feel someone scratching her face. Her eyes opened groggily and saw Long Feiye standing by her bed, gently stroking her cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you do last night? Still not getting up?” He observed her from above. Actually, he hadn’t gone to sleep until he saw her close her window, so he knew exactly what she’d done.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a start, Han Yunxi looked out the window and discovered that it was barely daylight. Because they were leaving in secret, they had to get up early. She was about to rise when she suddenly clutched her sheets to her chest. Without a word, Long Feiye understood and turned to descend the stairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll wait for you downstairs for breakfast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi assumed he’d climbed up to see her and privately cursed Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>for not waking her up. But actually, Long Feiye gave the old woman a fright when he came down. </span><i><span style>Did His Highness Duke of Qin climb in through the window last night again?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Her two masters were very strange. They had such huge sleeping quarters with a nice circular bed, but insisted on sleeping together in the tiny twin bed upstairs? What kind of hobby was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Han Yunxi finished washing up and went downstairs, she was greeted by Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>ambiguous gaze. She stared back in confusion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anything wrong?” Han Yunxi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“N-nothing,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>smiled and shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what are you staring for?” Han Yunxi asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei’s </span></i><span style>complexion looks quite well. Still, some mending is required,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If my complexion’s well, what’s there to mend?” Han Yunxi’s appetite disappeared as soon as she thought of aged chicken soup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your body, ah. His Highness is full of vitality and vigor,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>murmured in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does that have to do with mending my b--” Abruptly, Han Yunxi understood and narrowed her eyes. She was about to scold Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>when Long Feiye’s appearance made the urge shrivel up and die. She pretended that nothing had happened at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness, the carriage is already waiting out back. This old servant has handed responsibilities for board and lodging to Xu Donglin and Uncle Gao. Now that East Jing’s river waters are rising, you can take a ferryboat. Setting out today will take you to the City of Daughters within a week,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>said simply before she withdrew, afraid to disturb them further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What were you two talking about just then?” Long Feiye asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing,” Han Yunxi definitely wouldn’t reveal it. She silently ate her breakfast while peeking at Long Feiye’s face as Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>words swirled in her head.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Full of vitality and vigor…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Does this guy...have that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye was concentrated on eating, but still managed to ask, “What are you staring at?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Noth...I didn’t sleep well last night,” Han Yunxi still didn’t dare to voice her thoughts out loud. Actually, there was no need for questions. Eventually, she’d experience that vigor for herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After breakfast, they went to the back gates and saw Gu Beiyue waiting by the exit on his wheelchair. He was dressed all in white, looking like a beautiful immortal beneath the sunlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness Duke of Qin, esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>may you have smooth journeys!” he said sincerely. Then he took out Lil Thing from his sleeve. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>don’t leave Lil Thing behind. He can be a valiant general as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil Thing didn’t know Mama Yunxi and Papa Long were going to Celestial Mountain. As it woke up sleepily, its gaze trailed from Mama Yunxi to the gentleman before finally resting on Papa Long. Though the sight didn’t make its fur stand on end as before, it was still dejected by the vision. It was about to burrow into Mama Yunxi’s sleeve when it saw the horse carriage and realized they were going out. Although it didn’t want to leave the gentleman, it was about time to return to Mama Yunxi’s side. Its first mission was to protect Mama Yunxi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil Thing waved a paw at Gu Beiyue until he smiled and waved back. The sight made Lil Thing wish it could wave at Gu Beiyue until the end of the world. Still, it was afraid of Papa Long and didn’t waste too much time. Soon enough, it went to hide inside Han Yunxi’s medical pouch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before leaving, Han Yunxi made sure to instruct, “Gu Beiyue, when we come back, how about meeting us at this same gate? But next time, on your feet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Gu Beiyue replied seriously. “This one will stand by the gates of the city. May you two return peacefully!”</span></p>
