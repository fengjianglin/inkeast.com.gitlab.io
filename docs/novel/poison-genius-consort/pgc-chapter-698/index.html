 <p style="text-align: left;">Chapter <span style>698: Be careful, it's an ambush</span><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye’s sword pointed at Duanmu Yao, who could feel his killing intent! Even an outsider like Han Yunxi, who didn’t practice martial arts, could feel an involuntary chill. It had been ages since she seen Long Feiye be so icy cold.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Long Feiye wants to take Duanmu Yao’s life?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was very surprised. </span><i><span style>If he killed her, how will he explain things to the sword sect master?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao was so terrified that she couldn’t even bother worrying over her face. </span><i><span style>How could he have the gall?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The two servant girls on the side quickly unsheathed their swords. Despite being sword experts in their own right, they couldn’t stand up to Long Feiye’s sword </span><i><span style>qi. </span></i><span style>He sent them scattering with a single sweep of his blade. Duanmu Yao wanted to take the chance to escape, but Long Feiye’s sword quickly stopped her again. She looked hesitantly towards the woods before turning back away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Long Feiye, how dare you!” she shouted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why wouldn’t he dare? </span></i><span style>Without a word, he stabbed the blade straight through Duanmu Yao’s </span><i><span style>dantian! </span></i><span style>In a flash, Duanmu Yao’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Long Feiye, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next instant, he had withdrawn the weapon from her stomach. Holding Han Yunxi in one hand and his sword in the other, he turned to stab at the figure who tried to ambush him from behind! Only one foot shifted in the entire process; the rest of his body was still level with the ground. Han Yunxi was left leaning backwards from the momentum of the spin, her footsteps matching his. But all she saw was the sharp edge of a sword staring her down!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Long Feiye and her had moved a second later, the attacker would had stabbed her through the back. What a dangerous sneak attack!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sword from behind hung in the air before Han Yunxi. If it sliced, it could split her clear in half. Meanwhile, Long Feiye’s weapon was aimed at the abdomen of their attacker. If he stabbed, it would cleave him right through. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just who...was their attacker?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Long Feiye and Han Yunxi stared at the man, but couldn’t recognize him beneath his dark clothes and face veil. Naturally, Long Feiye knew of hidden ambushes in the forest, but didn’t pay them any mind until this one came to attack them from behind. It was quite some distance between their location and the woods, but he hadn’t sensed the killer until he was quite close. Without a doubt, this was a formidable foe!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The City of Daughters had already departed with their mercenaries. What other high level experts had colluded with Duanmu Yao and dared to take Long Feiye as an enemy? Han Yunxi prepared to launch needles from her hand, only to hear the attack laugh coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>blades may have no eyes, but this old man certainly does. If you move another inch, prepare to shoulder the consequences!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He expected Han Yunxi to be afraid, but she only sighed calmly. “Aye, what’s this </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>to do when faced with such a shameless sneak? Guess I can only fold!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You!”</span></i><span style> the man grew incensed enough to strike, but Long Feiye gave him a warning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Prepare for the consequences!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attacker stopped, and the three of them were left in a mute stalemate. Duanmu Yao clutched her bleeding wound as she laid physically paralyzed on the ground. But her eyes were fixated on the scene as her breathing grew cautious and quiet. Within the white mists of the luxuriant forest and glimmering lake, dead silence fell upon the scene. The question of life or death laid within the difference of one sword and one thought. Han Yunxi and Long Feiye were both on edge, though the attacker and Duanmu Yao were even tenser. That was because both sides seemed equally matched, but Long Feiye actually had the advantage if he was willing to give up Han Yunxi. It would be simple enough work for him to just kill the other man with one stab.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, Duanmu Yao suddenly cried out. “Senior brother, kill him! He’s Cang Qiuzi! If you kill him today, we can pretend today’s events never happened. I won’t let a peep slip to master, either!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right. The masked assailant was none other than Cang Qiuzi himself. Duanmu Yao was the one to invite him here to help kill Han Yunxi. Originally, the plan was flawless, but she never expected Long Feiye to turn a killing eye on her without Cang Qiuzi lifting a finger. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A cold smirk crept onto Long Feiye’s features. He had long guessed the identity of the attacker. After all, the City of Daughters would never cooperate with the all-male Carefree City, so the only ones with skills enough to sneak up on him were either master or this man. Ignoring Duanmu Yao, he simply asked, “Martial Uncle Cang can chose himself whether to live or die, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I chose to live! Your martial uncle fears death the most, hehe,” Cang Qiuzi removed his face veil and laughed out loud. Still, his heart was filled with tremulation. Who knew that Long Feiye would sense his presence at the last second? How long had it been since they last fought? </span><i><span style>This brat, his martial arts’ improved even after such a serious injury.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you’re afraid, then you should act more like it,” Long Feiye might need to look up to Cang Qiuzi, but his tone was as arrogant as always. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Cang Qiuzi couldn’t seize any advantages in a verbal argument and resort to an impatient snap. “This old man will count to three. We’ll withdraw our swords at the same time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll count together,” Long Feiye declared. If Cang Qiuzi was the only one talking, he’d be setting the pace for them both, leaving his side at a disadvantage. Withdrawing their swords meant that they were choosing to end the stalemate, but also that their battle would began anew. Not a single instance of carelessness would be allowed. Both men were on guard. Han Yunxi secretly prepared more poison needles while Duanmu Yao watched the scene anxiously from the sidelines. She didn’t even realize that she was growing right now. What was she to do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had ended up offending both sides. Who would save her now? She didn’t want to die!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>At the word, Long Feiye’s sword awn flashed into being at the same time Cang Qiuzi’s blade hummed with energy. Han Yunxi kept her eyes firmly fixed on their enemy’s weak spots from her vantage point while Duanmu Yao did her best to press against her wound and push off against the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In an instant, all of Long Feiye’s sword energy concentrated to its tip. Cang Qiuzi’s blade stopped humming, Han Yunxi found a location to target, and Duanmu Yao was now up on her knees. Before the third shout could fall, both Long Feiye and Cang Qiuzi readied their weapons to prepare for a new battlefield. Now whoever took the first move would be the winner! Everyone gathered their energies to make the final, fateful call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both men withdrew their blades as promised! With the threat gone from his abdomen, Cang Qiuzi immediately lashed out with his sword again, filled with killing intent; Han Yunxi was freed from the sword looming over her form, while Long Feiye dragged her down so they both landed squarely on the ground. His sword expelled a large swath of energy before he zeroed in on Duanmu Yao. At the same time, he lifted both legs to catch the edge of Cang Qiuzi’s blade. Seeing this, Cang Qiuzi abandoned his weapon, avoided Han Yunxi’s ensuing barrage of poison needles, and flipped in mid-air to kick aside Long Feiye’s sword before it could reach Duanmu Yao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately, Long Feiye straightened up and lashed out with his whip to wrap around Duamu Yao’s waist. At the same time, Cang Qiuzi caught the girl by her arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, the two fighters reached a stalemate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye wanted Duanmu Yao dead, while Cang Qiuzi wanted her alive. But Duanmu Yao didn’t give either side time to tarry. Long Feiye’s whip was lashed tight around her torso, which was already bleeding from the stomach. Now the pressure made her blood gush out like a spring. She forgot all about her face and her </span><i><span style>dantian </span></i><span style>to scream and cry at them both. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go of me, both of you! Master won’t forgive either of you! Save me, ah! ….save me, Master…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi stood behind Long Feiye, eyes narrowed as she aimed for Cang Qiuzi’s head. If they could take care of the man today, there would be much less trouble when they went to Celestial Mountain later. But she’d hardly launched her needles when a rock came flying out of the pathway to knock them aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s there!” Greatly alarmed, Long Feiye grew distracted, giving Cang Qiuzi the chance to drag Duanmu Yao to his side and escape into the maze. Han Yunxi immediately sent poison into the mists. It was impossible to use fatal toxins over such a large area, but she knew ones that could keep Cang Qiuzi and Duanmu Yao from being able to move. As long as they trapped them first, they could figure out ways to track them down later. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything had finished in an instant, with the difference between life and death just hanging by a hair. Yet Han Yunxi was neither scared by the course of events, or flustered by their passing. Still, calm, and cold, she peered into the pathway with such a serious expression that even Long Feiye didn’t dare to disturb her. She was trying to figure out a way to seek out Cang Qiuzi and Duanmu Yao from within the formation. There was no way to ascertain where they’d stopped, but she was sure they’d have to eventually. Being poisoned would make it impossible for them to get out of the matrix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While she wracked her brains for ideas, she waited for the poison to take effect. Long Feiye accompanied her in silence, yet it wasn’t long before she suddenly spun to face him with an expression of horror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Long Feiye, someone dispelled the poison!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Long Feiye was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of the poison’s gone! Every bit from the mist! They’ve got a helper who’s a poisons master!” As Han Yunxi explained, she sent out poison once again. But her opponent seemed tailor made to challenge her. Soon enough, her toxins were dispelled again. This happened multiple times before Han Yunxi gave her, because any further efforts would be futile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jun Yixie?” Han Yunxi muttered to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doesn’t seem like it,” Long Feiye glanced at the rock that had been thrown at them before. To precisely target poison needles with a projectile from so far away spoke of remarkable prowess. From what he knew of Jun Yixie’s skills, it was impossible unless the man had vastly improved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A complex look settled onto Long Feiye’s features as he muttered, “The person who rescued Jun Yixie…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His master…” Han Yunxi’s gaze grew complicated as well. Although they still didn’t know the identity of the mysterious rescuer, the only possible suspect was Jun Yixie’s master, the former head of the Hundred Poisons Sect. The scouts that Medicine City had sent to infiltrate the sect had all been killed, so there was no way to follow up on the clues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duanmu Yao certainly has a wide range of connections!” Han Yunxi laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye only looked back at the unconscious Grand Concubine Yi as he pondered over something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Han Yunxi suddenly sensed poison mist emanating from the pathway. Without a doubt, their enemy was now attacking with toxins as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Long Feiye,” she said, “They’re planning to trap us here!”</span></p>
