 <p>Chapter 20: Urgent rescue&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volaretranslations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the carriage turned into an alley, it soon drew to a stop. The driver spoke in surprise. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>there’s trouble ahead. A person’s lying on the ground. I say...we should take a detour.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi lifted the curtains and saw a young man in blue robes sprawled on the ground. She couldn’t see his face, but noticed that he was trying to reach a hand towards them as if asking for help. Her natural instincts as a doctor, combined with her sensitive nature, had her immediately jumping out of the carriage. As a physician, she knew the difference between life and death might depend on one thought. Though the driver tried to stop her, he failed and ended up following after her instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>don’t bother with matters that don’t concern you. What if he’s a criminal?” the driver shouted. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>today’s the second day of your marriage! Grand Concubine Yi’s waiting for you! Let’s just…” Helpless, the driver stopped pleading. As she drew closer to the blue-robed youth, an alarm went off in Han Yunxi’s head. There was poison here--and it was hypertoxic. She immediately flipped the person over, revealing a clean and pretty face with the cultivated aura of a young lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“S...save…” His face was ashen white and his lips were turning purple. It was hard for him to even speak before he finally fainted. The driver hurried over and recognized the man in alarm. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>t-this...this is General Mu’s young son, General Mu Qingwu!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mu Qingwu?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi’s memories knew this man. He was Tianning Country’s bravest and most skilled young general and General Mu’s only heir. Within the country, he was a man of blunt speech who openly admonished others. Courageous and prudent, he was also serious and cool-headed, immune to flattery with his righteousness. Rumors had it that he went out to battle in place of his father three times to defeat Northern Li Country, spreading dread and admiration amongst their military officials.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why had such an outstanding figure fainted from poison in this alley?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi didn’t have time to worry about details. She immediately activated her detoxification system and set about to help him. Very soon, she turned sober upon realizing this toxin was similar to Long Feiye’s snake poison. Its records existed in her detox system, but she lacked the ingredients to cure it. She lamented the fact that no one was around to give her a system upgrade.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>All right, that was asking for too much…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After the dextox system completed a thorough scan, it determined the site of the injury as a highly poisoned area on his abdomen. Immediate action was required if she wanted to fully expunge the toxins; otherwise, delays would only make things more difficult. Han Yunxi didn’t think much before undoing Mu Qingwu’s clothes. When the driver saw, he was shocked. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>y-you, what are you doing?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up! Turn and stand watch, don’t let anyone get close,” Han Yunxi said coldly, a fiendish temper in her eyes. She wouldn’t tolerate any insubordination. After prying apart the robes, Han Yunxi found no wound on his stomach. However, the detoxification system wouldn’t make a mistake. She initiated another scan that confirmed the location again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her careful eyes looked over the area while pressing down on the stomach as her expression quickly turned into amazement. It was a poisoned needle that had buried itself deep into the flesh, perhaps even penetrating the internal organs. Someone who could use needles to this extent wasn’t just ruthless, but most likely a poisons expert! It was viable that there was a plot against Mu Qingwu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Poison that reached the internal organs would spread within the body with each passing day. At first, the victim would only show high fevers but no sign of illness. When the organs began to fester, even an immortal would be hard pressed to keep their lives on this earth. The poison needle had to be extracted before toxins seeped into the organs!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi intentionally made pressing motions against Mu Qingwu’s stomach with no success. Deciding quickly, she withdrew a small dagger and precisely made a cut along his side. But right at this moment, a group of soldiers rushed down the alley to surround her. At their head was Mu Qingwu’s personal guard Li Changfeng[1], who saw the dagger in Han Yunxi’s hand and rushed to kick it aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Attempted murder of the young general! Men, seize her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>-o-</span></p>
 <p><span style>[1] </span><i><span style>Li Changfeng </span></i><span style>(李长峰) - </span><i><span style>Li </span></i><span style>is the surname, also meaning ‘plum’, </span><i><span style>Changfeng </span></i><span style>could mean “long peak, long summit.”</span></p>
