 <p>Chapter 12: A clever bribe <span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volaretranslations.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>CRASH!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi dropped the lantern in her hands again, so shocked that her face turned white. </span><i><span style>Wedding night? Your lordship? What was this guy trying to say?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye rose to his feet, measuring her with one look before brushing past her to the bedroom, exactly like someone who owned the place. It took awhile for Han Yunxi to chase after him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...you’re Long Feiye?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impertinence!” Long Feiye replied coldly. There were few people in this world who dared called him by his full name. When he hurried back home, he hadn’t expected them to send Han Yunxi here. This place was his private quarters. </span></p>
 <p><span style>While Han Yunxi found it a bit unbelievable, she was still convinced of his identity. Now she was berating herself for being so foolish. </span><i><span style>What kind of assassin didn’t even bother with a face mask? What kind of killer carried such a lordly aura about them? </span></i><span style>There was vexation because things had suddenly gotten complicated. There was still poison inside this fellow’s body. Even if only a trace was left, there was still a risk of death. With this man as the duke, if he died--wouldn’t she be buried alive with him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re really Han Yunxi?” Long Feiye’s icy gaze seemed to bore right through her. There were too many suspicious details in regards to this woman. Plenty of people in this world wanted to kill him, though none had successfully planted agents by this side. Then again, if this woman really was an agent, he would’ve died just then. Han Yunxi’s face was full of depression as she allowed him to continue to stare. She couldn’t help but think that there was no way this man would see the truth about her time travel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Answer your lordship’s question,” said Long Feiye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi sucked in a breath and walked over to lean against a pillar. “Duke of Qin, this question isn’t important. What’s crucial now is the poison in your body...actually, ...I didn’t get rid of it all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say?” Long Feiye was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s still some poison left in your body that I couldn’t draw out with my needles. You’ll need medicine to absorb the toxins, but I don’t have any of those kinds on hand. If you don’t believe me, then breathe deeply and see if that spot beneath your heart gives you a stabbing pain.” Han Yunxi spoke earnestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye took a deep breath and did feel some pain. In an instant, his eyes were filled with killing intent. “You really are bold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke of Qin, you have a poor choice of words. When I thought you were an assassin, you didn’t reveal your true identity. Even if I’d killed you then, it would’ve served you right.” Han Yunxi said in her defense.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Served him right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye turned his ice-cold stare on Han Yunxi’s eyes, but she wasn’t afraid. She merely gave a level look back and allowed him to gaze as he wished.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This woman had guts.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A flicker of admiration passed through his eyes, unnoticed by even himself, before he spoke in a cold tone. “Now you know. You should tell me which ingredients you’re missing, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi couldn’t help but suspect what various kinds of unsavory things this man had done. Instead of finding a doctor to treat his poisons, he’d hidden himself away in these rooms. It seemed like he couldn’t afford to make his injury public. Although it was against her medical morals to take advantage of misfortune, this concerned her post-marriage life. She had to consider things carefully. Everyone knew that it was no guarantee she’d stay in the Duke of Qin’s house even if she got in. She was very clear on this point. In that case, she needed someone to depend on and the strongest pillar would be the lord of the household, Tianning Country’s all important member of the imperial family, the Duke of Qin, Long Feiye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A crafty&nbsp;smile crept onto Han Yunxi’s features. “Your highness[1], actually...the medicine I gave you now can still hold back the poison for 10 days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So?” Long Feiye stared at her as before, the pupils filled with endless ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi adopted an innocent, timid manner as she spoke pathetically. “Tomorrow when I serve tea to the grand imperial concubine and pay my respects in court, could your highness accompany me as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first day after the wedding, the bride had to serve tea to the elders in her new family. As long as this fellow agreed to go with her, then it’d mean he accepted her as his </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>[1]. With his recognition, her life in the household would be much less difficult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And if his lordship isn’t willing?” Long Feiye asked coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi lowered her head innocently. “<em>Wangye</em>’s[3] poison isn’t so rare, you can find any kind of imperial physician to treat it.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Tch,</span></i><span style> you’re very clever!” If he could find an imperial physician, why would Long Feiye waste his time here? This roundabout woman had managed to tactfully threaten him again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi had a very pretty smile. “Thanks to your highness&nbsp;for his praise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye couldn’t help but knit his brows, feeling somewhat helpless against her. There was no way to tell what he was thinking, but he finally waved her off. “Just watch your mouth. You may leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was thrilled.</span><i><span style> Success!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, many thanks to Your Highness&nbsp;Duke of Qin,” she excitedly retreated from the bedroom, even taking care to let down the curtains for Long Feiye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only...after she’d turned around to face the dark room, she realized that this was her wedding night.</span><i><span style> Where exactly was she supposed to go?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-o-</span></p>
 <p><span style>[1] </span><i><span style>Your highness&nbsp;</span></i><span style>(陛下) - <em>dian</em></span><i><span style>&nbsp;xia, </span></i><span style>different from your lordship (本王/</span><i><span style>ben wang</span></i><span style>) in its a more formal way of address.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[2] </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style> (王妃) - his official wife in name and in title, his duchess to his duke, his married partner, etc. Higher status than any concubine.</span></p>
