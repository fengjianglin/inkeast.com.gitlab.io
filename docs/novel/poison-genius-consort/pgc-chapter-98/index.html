 <p>Chapter&nbsp;98: Living in fortune without knowing fortune&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Only in charge of cleanup? That’s not what the Duke of Qin said!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>gave a start before speaking earnestly, “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>this old servant...doesn’t understand what you mean.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Han Yunxi was doubtful as well. “What did His Highness Duke of Qin tell you to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>didn’t know why esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>would suddenly ask her this question, but she repeated her self-introduction again. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>His Highness Duke of Qin told this old servant to come and serve you. If there’s anything needed in the future, please tell this old servant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Han Yunxi was shocked. Long Feiye had lied to her! No, he’d seized the opportunity to say he thought her place was dirty! Whether or not her place was dirty had nothing to do with him, so did he have to use such a venomous tongue?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ludicrous!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi curled her lip and was about to speak when Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>spoke again. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>don’t you worry. Although this old servant is getting on in years, I’m much more easy to order around than those young girls. I’ve been here ever since the Duke of Qin’s residence was built.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That early? Then you should be counted as one of the senior figures here, right?” Han Yunxi found this unexpected. Little Chen Xiang was brand new with no background, so she didn’t have to fret about her. This Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>had so much history that she must have had complicated experiences. She wouldn’t by chance be in league with Grand Concubine Yi and the rest, would she?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh, this old servant’s indeed a senior figure,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>said proudly. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>this old servant used to be from the imperial palace and watched His Highness grow up! His Highness trusts this old servant, so after he was made duke, he only brought me along. All affairs, both big and small in the Hibiscus Courtyard, are taken care of by this one here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words were even more unexpected! </span><i><span style>So there was a servant in the Hibiscus Courtyard after all.</span></i><span style> She thought so! </span><i><span style>How could the guards clean the place so well if there wasn’t a servant on hand?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How come I’ve never seen you before?” Of course, she was most concerned about this question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A few months ago, I went to my hometown in the south. As soon as I returned today, His Highness called me over,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>said. Afraid that Han Yunxi didn’t believe her, she added, “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>I know all the guards in this Hibiscus Courtyard. If you don’t believe me, you can ask them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>didn’t even have time to unpack her luggage when she arrived before His Highness summoned her to clean up Leisurely Cloud Pavilion, especially its study. When Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>came and found out the new Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>was living here, she was filled with doubts. She never expected his highness to allow such a woman to live in the Hibiscus Courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Didn’t he reject the thought of this marriage often in the past?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw the smelly mess on the study table, she was completely terrified. His Highness had a severe case of mysophobia and hated filth and mess. Yet he still allowed esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>to reduce the study to such a state? Only after Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>cleaned everything up did His Highness deign to enter and sit down in the host’s seat. His first words were, “Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>in the future you’ll be serving here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was naturally curious, and tried to probe him with a question. “I heard that Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>is very beautiful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But His Highness didn’t utter a word, nor did he look at her. Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>naturally dared to ask no more, but couldn’t help but wonder if he doted on this Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei. </span></i><span style>While she cleaned the courtyard, she found a guard and asked him about it. However, the guard wasn’t any the wiser. Though Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was still puzzled and disbelieving after pondering over it for a hundred times, she could ascertain one thing: since His Highness had allowed Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>to live in the Hibiscus Courtyard and sent her over as a servant, he’d acknowledged this esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A woman acknowledged by His Highness was naturally someone she’d serve with all her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>explanation, Han Yunxi asked, “Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>in that case, you’ve served His Highness since he was young, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>smiled and nodded, looking kind and benevolent. “All these years, His Highness is only used to this old servant serving him. This old servant’s clearer on his moods than even Grand Concubine Yi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you come here, then His Highness…” Han Yunxi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>isn’t this all one courtyard? Don’t you worry, this old servant won’t be lazy,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi remained stunned before saying </span><i><span style>‘oh’ </span></i><span style>in response. She waved her hand. “Understood. There’s nothing else, so you can busy yourself first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>what do you want to eat tonight? This old servant will tell the kitchens,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was quite conscientious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You be the judge,” Han Yunxi said simply. Her entire mind was in disorder, so how could she think about what to eat? </span></p>
 <p><span style>After Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>left, she sat unmoving on one side. Long Feiye actually gave her such an important servant? </span><i><span style>Was there a plot involved? Was she here to monitor her? </span></i><span style>Quickly, Han Yunxi discarded the idea. She was already within Long Feiye’s sphere of influence in the Hibiscus Courtyard, so wasn’t it easy to spy on her?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It really was strange!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What did that fellow mean by this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>That night, Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>told the kitchens to cook quite a few meals. She really was a competent servant, doing all sorts of tasks proactively before retreating when she wasn’t needed so as to not disturb her masters. Han Yunxi had no idea that Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was secretly watching her from the shadows, though. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She had a good impression of this esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>but she still couldn’t understand. </span><i><span style>Why did His Highness Duke of Qin take a fancy to this woman? </span></i><span style>She once made a bet with Chu Xifeng. The latter bet that his highness wouldn’t be interested in woman before he reached his 30th birthday. She bet that he wouldn’t be moved by any woman for the rest of his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But since the Hibiscus Courtyard had a mistress now, Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was still very happy. At the very least, their Duke of Qin wouldn’t be lonely in his old age. Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>decided that she should get closer to this mistress until they were familiar with each other, then teach her how to take care of His Highness. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she finished busying herself in the study, Han Yunxi sat in the courtyard drinking tea, waving a hand at Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>to get her to come over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What orders does esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>have?” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was very respectful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>I don’t have many rules of etiquette here, don’t make things so complicated. Sit,” Han Yunxi said, patting the seat beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>masters and servants differ in rank, this servant cannot sit,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was very earnest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi sighed. This woman really was a servant of the imperial palace, quite different from little Chen Xiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you can sit on the low stool,” Han Yunxi said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei,” </span></i><span style>Only then did Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>sit on one side, lowering her head to Han Yunxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi dawdled for a bit before asking in a low voice, “His Highness has a Junior Sister, did you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At these words, Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>eyes filled with laughter. “I know. It’s Western Zhou Country’s Princess Changle, Duanmu Yao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was just sounding her out, but didn’t expect Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>to really know these things and reply her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then which sect do they hail from?” she asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Celestial Mountain Sword Sect,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>answered without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was surprised that she’d answered so easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Celestial Mountain Sword Sect was one of three great martial arts schools that specialized in sword mastery. Rumors had it that their examinations were extremely strict, so only one disciple was accepted per year. It wasn’t surprising that Long Feiye was accepted, considering his inhuman skills. What surprised Han Yunxi was that Duanmu Yao got in as well. If that was the case, her martial arts skills should be top-notch..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, she had no time to ponder over such things. She was curious whether Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>really would answer all her questions. A crafty look flitted past her eyes as Han Yunxi asked again. “Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>His Highness is often out at night without returning home. He should have other places to live outside, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>paused. Seeing this, Han Yunxi’s lips curled up into a smile. Looks like she’d sounded out the right question. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>next reaction exceeded her expectations. She looked around them before lowering her voice. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>this relates to His Highness’s personal affairs. This old servant will tell you, but don’t say that I did. Neither should you tell anyone else.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Eh…?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was surprised by the turn of events. As Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>prepared to speak, her eyes widened and she stopped her. “W-wait! Why are you telling me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>gave a start, all innocence. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>you’re the one who asked first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll say it just because I asked?” Han Yunxi retorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>looked at her before suddenly smiling like an old urchin. “So esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>was testing her servant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The exposed Han Yunxi was a little embarrassed as she frowned. “Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>you’re overthinking things. There’s nothing else, you can leave now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>didn’t go. She grinned and said, “It’s only natural for esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>to be suspicious. This servant is the Duke of Qin’s, after all, and esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei</span></i><span style> hasn’t been welcomed here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi’s eyes turned cold at these words. This old </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>really wasn’t so simple. Was she planning to lay her cards on the table at last?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What else do you want to say?” she asked coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But once again, Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>exceeded her expectations. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>you can set your cares at rest. This old servant is definitely one of His Highness’s people. I was given to His Highness by the previous emperor and have no relationship with Grand Concubine Yi. This old servant is faithful and devoted to His Highness!” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>wrinkles were stretched taut on her face because she was so serious. Han Yunxi didn’t expect her to say such things. </span><i><span style>So there was no connection with Grand Concubine Yi!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But she still didn’t understand. “Since you’re faithful and devoted, why are you betraying him so easily?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>is His Highness’s official wife. How is it betrayal for this old servant to answer a few of your questions?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>answer left Han Yunxi speechless, but she only felt like she was being mocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>you’re either really muddleheaded or pretending to be. I’m just an ornament at most, but you’re treating me like the real thing? You’ve served His Highness for so many years, so you should know he wasn’t willing to marry me.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Official wife?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She probably couldn’t even measure up to one of Long Feiye’s subordinates. They didn’t even count as friends, only strangers who’d made business deals a few times. So much trouble had come from carrying this title of official wife. Han Yunxi’s stomach was filled with flames as she spoke. “Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>I’ll be grateful to Heaven and Earth if His Highness doesn’t find trouble for me. As for official wife, he can marry whoever he wants. I’m ready to give up my position anytime.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>had never heard any woman with the guts to turn her back on His Highness! Not just the Hibiscus Courtyard, but even the gates to the Duke of Qin’s residence had long lines of females wishing to get inside that could stretch throughout the city. </span><i><span style>But this lady disdained it to this extent! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was quite angry and spoke without thinking. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>for His Highness to leave you in the Hibiscus Courtyard and allow this servant to serve you, how could he not take you seriously? Moreover, Grand Concubine Yi wanted to take this servant from His Highness in the past, but he refused! Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>shouldn’t live in fortune without knowing fortune!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At these words, Han Yunxi wrinkled her eyebrows. Even Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was scared witless and quickly knelt on the ground. “Your servant is muddleheaded! Your servant was impetuous and spoke irresponsibly to offend esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei. </span></i><span style>Please mete punishment, esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi’s mouth twitched. For some reason, her heart suddenly started thump, thump, </span><i><span style>thumping </span></i><span style>as it quickened its beat.</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Han Yunxi:&nbsp;</strong>Enough with the chitchat. Who are you and what do you want?</p>
 <p><strong>Zhao&nbsp;<em>mama:&nbsp;</em></strong>Esteemed&nbsp;<em>wangfei,&nbsp;</em>I'm only the hired help...</p>
 <p><strong>Han Yunxi:</strong> Yeah, but I can count the help I've gotten over the last 97 chapters on the fingers of&nbsp;my hands!</p>
 <p><strong>Zhao&nbsp;<em>mama:&nbsp;</em></strong>Not to worry, esteemed&nbsp;<em>wangfei!</em> With this&nbsp;<em>mama&nbsp;</em>here, you'll have two more hands to count with in the future!</p>
 <p><strong>Han Yunxi:</strong> That's...</p>
 <p><strong>Zhao&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>mama:</strong>&nbsp;</em>If worse comes to worst, you can borrow my toes as well!</p>
