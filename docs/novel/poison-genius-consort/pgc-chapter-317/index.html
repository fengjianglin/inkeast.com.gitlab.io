 <p>Chapter 317: Medical supplement, hard to tell true from false&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faced with Gu Qishao’s adoring remark, Han Yunxi couldn’t help but roll her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really missed you,” Gu Qishao said earnestly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe she’d heard too much of his jokes, but Han Yunxi felt like rolling her eyes even more when he grew serious. People who tried their best to make jokes were the most detestable of all, weren’t they?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What else?” Han Yunxi asked helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Gu Qishao got down to business. “Where’s Mute Granny?” He wanted to follow Chu Xifeng that night as well, but he was too worried about Poison lass and so followed her instead. Han Yunxi’s sparkling eyes dimmed at the question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lowered her voice and said, “She was kidnapped and jumped off a cliff.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qishao was astonished. “And then?” Mute Granny was too vital to unlocking Han Yunxi’s true origins. Everything depended on that old woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her status is unclear,” Han Yunxi said, before adding, “They still haven’t found her body yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qishao’s gaze turned shrewd before he asked, “Who were the kidnappers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They were dressed in black and wore face masks, so we have no idea,” Han Yunxi said. She’d asked Chu Xifeng for details about the incident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of god has the skills to snatch a person from Long Feiye?” Gu Qishao had his doubts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Long Feiye had escorted Mute Granny personally that night, then she wouldn’t have…” Han Yunxi was very sad. She had always kept Mu Linger’s words at the back of her mind. She was the one who hurt Mute Granny. If she hadn’t taken Mute Granny from the Mu Estate, none of this would have happened. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be that easy to steal a person from Long Feiye’s men, either.” Gu Qishao had hidden meanings within his words. But Han Yunxi didn’t listen carefully enough and said, “It wasn’t Mu Yingdong. He still doesn’t know about it. </span><i><span style>Aye</span></i><span style>...who knows what Mute Granny’s kidnappers were thinking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qishao thought it over before he said, “Poison lass, do you have the antidote prescription for Broomcorn Millet Poison?” Han Yunxi had expelled Mute Granny’s poison in the past, but she needed an antidote to thoroughly cure her deaf-mute state. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the use of making an antidote without the person to use it on?” Han Yunxi said helplessly. She’d given the prescription to Long Feiye. Most likely, he hadn’t done anything with it either while he was busy searching for Mute Granny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qishao reached over his hand. “Let me have a look. I’ll help you search.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He wants to help me find the person and the antidote ingredients? Isn’t he a little too idle? </span></i><span style>Han Yunxi was starting to suspect that this guy had nothing to do all day. Of course, she was still happy to give him the prescription. His skills in finding medicinal ingredients were much stronger than Long Feiye’s. Broomcorn Millet Poison’s antidote only needed three ingredients: Serpent Fruit, Bear </span><i><span style>Chuan</span></i><span style>[1. </span><i><span style>Chuan </span></i><span style>(川) - a word that means “river” or “plain,” which doesn’t make much sense in the context of the ingredient name, so I left it as pinyin.], and Panoptic Red Lotus. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qishao had to click his tongue at the list. “These are all precious ingreidents!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t they? I’ve never seen any one of them. They’re hard to find,” Han Yunxi said seriously. If Mute Granny was still alive, she’d be more likely to find her than these three medicinal ingriedients. All of them grew under very exacting conditions and spent a long time to return maturity. They were rare to begin with, so the growing time only made them more limited. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite this, Gu Qishao was still confident. “Poison lass, don’t worry. Leave these two things to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having an extra person help out meant an extra helping of strength and a extra dose of hope. Han Yunxi nodded her head. “Mm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I do find her, how are you planning to repay me?” Gu Qishao asked with a grin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi’s serious expression gave way to a </span><i><span style>heheheh </span></i><span style>as she coldly narrowed her eyes. “You don’t have to look for her at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qishao’s smile stiffened. </span><i><span style>Is this woman my natural enemy? Aside from our first meeting in the cave, I feel like I’ve lost to her every single time. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>More and more, Han Yunxi realized that she enjoyed seeing Gu Qishao when he was caught speechless like this. Still, after all the jokes she had to ask, “Gu Qishao, will you stop liking me if I’m really from the remnants of the Poison Sect?” She could see Gu Qishao’s good points, but she recognized his motives as well. Ever since he grew interested in her poison skills, then her Tang Clan assassination weapons, then the embroidery on her medical pouch and his investigation into Lady Tianxin and later Mute Granny, his sole goal was to uncover her origins. He was very interested in knowing whether she was related to the Poison Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, his motive in hunting down Mute Granny was to see whether Mu Xin really had an affair from someone from that sect. He still didn’t know whether her father was Han Congan or a Poison Sect member. If she told him now that her father wasn’t Han Congan, but was mostly like from the Poison Sect, what would he feel? And why was he so fixated on finding out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no </span><i><span style>‘if,’” </span></i><span style>Gu Qishao was still smiling, but his determination still shone through his tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m saying, what if there </span><i><span style>is </span></i><span style>an ‘if?’” Han Yunxi kept probing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qishao suddenly rose to his feet and circled around the table to Han Yunxi’s side. She didn’t move, but waited as he approached. Gu Qishao didn’t speak, but locked eyes with Han Yunxi. His gaze was as cold as a falcon locking onto its prey. Han Yunxi felt her heart give a lurch as she allowed him to stare. She was caught a little unawares by the intensity of his eyes. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Does he have a grudge with the medical academy or the Poison Sect? Is he looking for members of the Poison Sect to take revenge? </span></i><span style>Han Yunxi grew guarded and was about to avoid his gaze when Gu Qishao backed away first. His long, narrow eyes curved into two crescents as he smiled like a bear. “See that, Poison lass? Did I scare you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was in the middle of leaning back when his words threw her for a loop. Caught off-guard, she could only gape at him before she fell backwards. Gu Qishao quickly stepped onto the table, grabbed Han Yunxi’s hand, and pulled her towards him before the two of them made a circle and recovered their bearings. As he held her, he said tenderly, “Poison lass, if you really are, then I’ll just pretend you aren’t. Do you believe me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you looking for the remnants of the Poison Sect?” Han Yunxi asked very seriously. Sometimes she found it hateful when Long Feiye never told her anything, but now she realized that Gu Qishao was the truly hateful one. He could say anything with a joking grin, but he never spoke the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to use them as a medical supplement so I can refine them into an antidote,” Gu Qishao was still sporting a grin without a trace of decency in his expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi shoved him aside. “Using humans as supplements to refine an antidote? What kind of poison do you have?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The most toxic poison in the world,” Gu Qishao chuckled. Han Yunxi simply ignored him. She’d been treating poisons for years, but she’d never heard of using humans as ingredients to make one. It was fine if this fellow didn’t want to tell her the truth. It’s not like she’d tell him the truth, either. Han Yunxi finished drinking the rest of her tea before preparing to leave. There were still important matters to deal with, so she couldn’t waste time chatting here with Gu Qishao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Gu Qishao blocked her way and gave her another tin of tea. “Here, newly picked tea leaves.” He knew she liked new teas. His tea plantation in Tianning might have been sealed up by Long Feiye, but he’d found the top-quality leaves in all the Cloud Realm Continent regardless. He was even reluctant to drink it himself!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks,” Han Yunxi really did like tea. She was already at the door before she turned around. “Gu Qishao, Mu Linger likes you alot. Don’t disappoint her.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, I like you a lot. You shouldn’t be disappointing </span><i><span style>me,” </span></i><span style>Gu Qishao said logically.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This guy...seriously! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi simply threw the tin of tea leaves back at him before leaving without a glance. Gu Qishao caught the tin and simply kept up his helpless smile. Even when Han Yunxi’s form had long left the building, Gu Qishao was still smiling. His bantering, seductive grin was bright and radiant. If Long Feiye had eyes that no one could see through, then Gu Qishao wore smiles that no one could understand. He stood at the window before glimpsing a sight of a familiar figure standing by an inn. That was none other than Mu Linger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, he’d ran into Mu Linger multiple times in the capital, but the girl had never caught sight of him. Despite this, he’d pass by her every time as if he didn’t recognize her at all. This time, Gu Qishao’s sights lingered on the girl before a crooked grin showed up on his face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Linger had just received a message via flying pigeon from her father, who told her to lay low for a while and avoid going back to Medicine City. Her unauthorized actions at the empress dowager’s birthday banquet, including keeping the gift and standing on Duke of Qin Long Feiye’s side, had spread as news to Medicine City. Both the Wang and Xie Clans were extremely discontent. At a Medicine City conference, they had said to punish her. Even denizens of the Mu Clan were crying out for severe punishment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was possible that the Wang and Xie Clans themselves did support Long Feiye, but how could they let go of such a good chance to show the Mu Clan genius a thing or two? On the other hand, both the old and younger generations of the Mu Clan wanted the favored Mu Linger to take a tumble or two. They were even more eager than the Wang and Xie Clans to see her punished. No matter how strong Mu Yingdong was, he couldn’t resist such pressure from the public and his own clan members! Moreover, the incident was Mu Linger’s fault to begin with!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could only delay the punishment by saying that Mu Linger’s whereabouts were currently unknown. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Linger was in an extremely bad mood after receiving the news. She returned to her rooms and fell on her back on the bed. Her eyebrows furrowed as she shut her eyes. She was a genius pharmacist, but how many people in Medicine City really wanted to see her thrive? It was probably only father. The rest of them would rather she died, instead! She really hadn’t fought for any special place or position. If possible, she wished she could be more ordinary.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Aye, and who knows where Qi gege is.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She was still sighing in her heart when she heard a familiar voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The damned lass who repaid kindness with enmity, hehe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Linger sat bolt upright on the bed, astonished, “Qi </span><i><span style>gege! </span></i><span style>Qi </span><i><span style>gege, </span></i><span style>where are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qishao landed from the ceiling rafters to give her a cold look. “Mu Linger, why didn’t I know your heart was so sinister and vicious when I met you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Linger knew he was referring to the incident in the Sky Pit. She bit her lip as her head hung. “I think I’m pretty sinister and vicious, too.”</span></p>
