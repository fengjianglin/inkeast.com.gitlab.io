 <p><span style>Chapter 168: What's happened to you, Empress?</span>&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What was wrong with the empress?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi stopped her questioning and looked towards the empress, who immediately averted her eyes. Long Tianmo helped her sit down on one side, filled with concern. “</span><i><span style>Muhou, </span></i><span style>are you all right? Is it too tiring?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone, call for an imperial physician!” the empress dowager said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet the empress stopped them both, her voice steady. “I’m all right, there’s no need…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling unconvinced, Han Yunxi resumed her questioning of Shuang Hong. “Shuang Hong, think it over carefully. You can’t leave anything out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shuang Hong had no idea why Han Yunxi was asking these questions. She didn’t even need to think about the answer. That night, Princess Changping sent her to fetch something at the same time she told her to take something away. It was just one object, and a very particular one at that, so she remember it very clearly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The empress sat on one side with her eyes fixated on Shuang Hong. Perhaps her gaze was too fierce, but Shuang Hong sensed the stare. She timidly looked over and had a big fright, before quickly averting her eyes. Now she felt uneasy. Why was the empress looking at her this way? Could it be that that object…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hesitated until Han Yunxi said coldly, “Shuang Hong, this is of monumental importance. Think it over carefully! If you lie, once the investigation’s through…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a reminder as well as a warning. Han Yunxi didn’t finish her sentence. Shuang Hong hung her head, her heart pounding. She stole another peek at the empress, still hesitant. It was at this time that the silent Long Feiye spoke up in an icy voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You need to think this long for something that happened only a few days ago?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shuang Hong raised her head and met Long Feiye’s cold eyes. In that instant, her soul fled from her body! </span><i><span style>Heavens, the Duke of Qin was looking at her and even personally interrogating her! Too terrifying!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>How could Shuang Hong dare to hesitate any further? She hastily replied, “Your servant remembers, remembers now! That day Princess Changping had your servant take away a wooden Buddha statue that belonged to the empress. Your servant left it in a room up ahead and hasn’t had time to put it back yet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words seemed to suck the very souls out of the empress, who completely collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It belonged to the empress?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was surprised. When she saw the empress’s reaction, she seemed to realize something. A complicated look flitted past her eyes as she spoke. “Where did you put it? Take me to it right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s in a little room on the right. Your servant didn’t touch it again after I left it there,” Shuang Hong said truthfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without another word, Han Yunxi walked over with Long Feiye close behind. The empress dowager and Long Tianmo were filled with even more doubts. What was going on now? What did Han Yunxi find out without telling them a thing? And yet, while grandmother and grandson were still puzzled, the empress suddenly jumped to her feet and chased after them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Muhou!” </span></i><span style>Long Tianmo shouted, finally realizing that his mother was acting strange. Although her feelings had been unstable for the past five to six days, today she was really…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong with her?” the empress dowager fretted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Tianmo didn’t know what to say, but hurried after her with the empress dowager. By now, Han Yunxi was in the room that Shuang Hong pointed out, but she hadn’t found a thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I clearly put it here. I didn’t move it afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When </span><i><span style>that </span></i><span style>happened that night, I even fell sick. I didn’t have a chance to come back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nobody would dare to move esteemed empress’s things! That was a new Buddha statue that the empress recently obtained!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>… …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shuang Hong was very anxious, afraid that the blame would fall onto her. Han Yunxi and Long Feiye looked around the room, only to see the empress standing by the doorway, staring at them both. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed empress, do you know where that Buddha statue went?” Han Yunxi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t,” the empress replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In other words, it’s been lost?” Han Yunxi asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no way such a thing can be lost, especially when it belongs to the empress! Shuang Hong, you better think it over clearly!” Long Tianmo said as he walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shuang Hong immediately knelt on the ground. “Your Highness Crown Prince, your servant didn’t remember wrongly. I placed it in this very room. Princess Changping wanted to personally carve a stone Buddha for the empress dowager as a New Year’s gift, but she didn’t have enough time. She hadn’t even finished engraving the lotus throne[1], so she told your servant that morning to borrow a wooden Buddha statue from esteemed empress as a model. Later on, the princess told me to fetch some gold powder and put the wooden Buddha away, so I put that here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So speaking, Shuang Hong suddenly added, “That’s right! Your servant remembers, that night your servant told the western wing’s Xiao Yue[2], she should know this was here, too!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone, summon Xiao Yue here!” Long Feiye ordered immediately.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xiao Yue?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The empress’s face turned green as she remained silent. Instead of Xiao Yue, it was Qian </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>who came instead. “To report to these masters, court lady Xiao Yue caught a foul disease two days ago. She’s already no more…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she finished, Han Yunxi had narrowed her eyes. Something so convenient had come from fishy circumstances. If she didn’t understand this much, then she would’ve lived this long for nothing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s the body?” she asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qian </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>darted a glance at the empress but managed to remain calm. “The body’s long been cremated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi’s smile was cold. “Then where is the item? Qian </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>you supervise the western wing of the palace, don’t you? Where did esteemed empress’s wooden Buddha statue go? Which one of your underlings has the guts to steal her things, are they looking for death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This...this…this old servant is unclear,” Qian </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>turned timid. She couldn’t understand how Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>knew to look for that exact item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of supervisor are you if you’re not clear?” Han Yunxi pressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frightened, Qian </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>face turned queasy as she fumbled for a reply. Han Yunxi looked towards the taciturn empress and asked, “Esteemed empress, don’t you know to look for something when it’s been lost?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An unhappy Long Tianmo was quick to rebut Han Yunxi’s words. “How would </span><i><span style>muhou </span></i><span style>be in the mood to look for anything? Imperial Qin Aunt, just what do you need that thing for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, you’re here to investigate poison. What does it matter if they’ve lost something here?” the empress dowager was displeased as well. Of course, she and Long Tianmo could tell that something was amiss, but they couldn’t figure out how these two things were related. Or perhaps they were afraid of the terrifying truth it implied. At this point, it was clear that the empress was involved in some way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi ignored them both and looked coldly at the empress, who bit her teeth and met her eyes with the last of her reason. But Han Yunxi suddenly announced, “That wooden Buddha statue is the source of the poison…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An uproar came at her words, startling even Long Feiye. He knew that Han Yunxi was looking for the statue because of its connection to the poison, but never thought that the statue itself was poisonous!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“N-no...no, that’s not it…” the empress murmured to herself as she began to shake her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi continued to speak. “Changping had an injury on her hand and was poisoned by natural means after accidentally touching the source of the poison. There’s no such things as coincidences in this world. Whoever’s trying to hide the Buddha statue is the one who knows the truth! In other words, the one who hid the statue is the person who killed Changping!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words were like a cudgel that smacked the empress’s head. Finally, the empress who was falling apart couldn’t take it anymore and shouted out, “I’m not the killer! I’m not!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was momentarily stunned. <em>Why...why was the empress saying these things?</em> Wasn’t this just like burying 300 taels of silver and putting a sign on top that said </span><i><span style>‘No silver buried here?’ </span></i><span style>So the empress was the one who’d hidden the statue?</span></p>
 <p><span style>While everyone was still digesting the news, the empress threw herself at Han Yunxi, shouting at the top of her lungs. “It’s not true! It’s not like that! You’re the murderer! You are! You didn’t save Changping, so you’re the killer!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The quick-footed Long Feiye seized the empress by her hand and shoved her harshly towards Long Tianmo. But like a woman possessed, she struggled wildly towards Han Yunxi, still denouncing her, “Why didn’t you save her? Why?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, aren’t you very impressive? Why didn’t you save her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why couldn’t you have gone over earlier? Why didn’t you help her? If you were a bit earlier, she wouldn’t have died, </span><i><span style>sobsob…”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yunxi, you must have let Changping die on purpose! You’re the one that hurt Changping, not me...</span><i><span style>not me…”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>… …</span></p>
 <p><span style>The empress’s reaction went beyond everyone’s expectations. Long Tianmo could only stay stunned in place. </span><i><span style>How could this be? It was the empress?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible, a tiger wouldn’t eat its cubs, so how could the empress do such a thing! Han Yunxi, don’t slander others!” the empress dowager fell into a violent rage. How could she believe such a thing? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Han Yunxi had started harboring suspicions after she found out about the statue, she was still startled by the empress’s behavior. For a second, she didn’t know how to reply. Only Long Feiye was calm enough to speak out. “Qian </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>where is the item? Hurry and bring it out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qian </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>didn’t know this item was related to Changping’s death, but seeing the empress’s reaction had robbed her of all her courage. Her teeth chattered as she replied, “It’s b-buried...buried in the back garden! Your servant didn’t know a thing, esteemed empress, she… She told your servant to bury it back there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qian </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>words were a decisive judgment against the empress. The empress dowager staggered back a few steps until she bumped into the door, looking at the empress with disbelieving eyes. The empress was still paralyzed in Long Tianmo’s arms, crying uncontrollably. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye brought along Qian </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>to personally retrieve the statue. He didn’t touch it directly as it was wrapped up tightly in a cloth bundle. As soon as it was brought in, Han Yunxi’s detox system alarms started blaring--this thing had poison! She personally undid the wrappings and saw the statue, before her nerves snapped!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heavens! This was poison arrow wood!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This statue had been carved from the roots of an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiaris" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style>Antiaris toxicaria</span></i></a> <span style>tree. Although the roots and bark of such trees had their uses, they had to be soaked first for multiple days to eliminate the poison. But the statue before here hadn’t been thoroughly treated at all. Small traces of poisonous tree sap remained in the wood, and upon closer examination, the base of the statue was still moist. This poison would only take effect after it entered the bloodstream, so not everyone would get poisoned from a simple touch. But an injured hand would definitely absorb the poison and lead its owner to death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, those who’d never seen poison arrow wood before found the conclusions hard to believe. Long Tianmo couldn’t control his emotions and demanded, “How do you know this is the source of the poison?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead of replying, Han Yunxi had someone catch her a live chicken. A thrashing rooster was delivered into the room, and Han Yunxi personally took hold of it to slash a small cut on its claw. Then she touched the base of the statue to the injury before letting the rooster go. In an instant, everyone saw the rooster take a few steps before it toppled to the ground.</span></p>
