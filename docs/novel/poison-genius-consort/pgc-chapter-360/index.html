 <p>Chapter 360: Constantly protecting you&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After leaving the palace, Long Feiye accompanied Han Yunxi back to the Duke of Qin’s estate. Han Yunxi was planning to discuss the famine problems with him when they got home, but Long Feiye had to leave for business immediately. When she saw him leaving, she anxiously cried out, “Your Highness…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, Long Feiye turned around at the same time, intending to talk to her too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness, you go first.” “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them spoke at the same time, causing Han Yunxi to smile. She got straight to the point. “Your Highness, take </span><i><span style>chenqie </span></i><span style>with you to the disaster areas. Pestilence runs rampant in those places, so </span><i><span style>chenqie </span></i><span style>can constantly protect you if I come along.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On one side, Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>couldn’t resist a soft cough. </span><i><span style>Esteemed wangfei’s getting more and more thick-skinned. She’s a doctor of poisons and skilled in detoxification, but her medical skills are only average at best. </span></i><span style>Many times, she had to consult Imperial Physician Gu for help with medical matters. More importantly, she didn’t knock a lick of martial arts, but she even said she’d ‘constantly protect’ His Highness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>dearly wished that esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>could go along with His Highness Duke of Qin, an excuse like that was too much, even for her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Constantly protect me?” Long Feiye asked with interest lighting his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, Han Yunxi just wanted to come along. Long Feiye would definitely bring along his own guards and doctors from the Imperial Physician Courtyard to the disaster areas. She didn’t need to worry at all. The longer Long Feiye stared at her, the more she was struck with a guilty conscience. Still, she held his gaze well. After all, in their journey of 100 steps, she had to keep walking towards him with a smile, step by step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her grin was as bright as flowers as she said with confidence, “That’s right, like a constant bodyguard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye was amused. For the first time ever, he broke into bright, hearty laughter. “Hahah, alright! Your lordship will take you along!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi had seen Long Feiye laugh a few times, but never so candidly. A word from her and a laugh from him seemed to close the distance between them even further. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did Your Highness want to say just then?” Han Yunxi asked next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing. Go and get ready, we’ll leave in three days’ time.” Long Feiye would never tell this foolish woman that he’d been preparing to ask her about the very thing she requested. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A delighted Han Yunxi didn’t bother to probe. “Alright, </span><i><span style>chenqie </span></i><span style>will prepare herself and wait for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Long Feiye left, Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>started pestering Han Yunxi as they walked back the whole way. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>bring this old servant with you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This old servant can constantly protect you as well! Moreover, I can help you and His Highness do the laundry and cook meals. You’ll still need someone to wait on you when you travel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>this old servant’s never left the capital city in her entire life…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi simply looked at Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>without saying a word, making her anxious to death. One mistress and servant entered the Leisurely Cloud Pavilion, Su Xiaoyu came to meet them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was very curious about the pair. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>where are you planning to go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Children shouldn’t ask so many questions,” Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>lectured her instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Xiaoyu blinked her eyes pitifully before stealing a peek at Han Yunxi. Then she obediently retreated to the side. Han Yunxi knew enough of them both to realize that Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>usually doted on Su Xiaoyu. She didn’t pay much attention to the aggrieved looking child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhao </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>it’s fine if you come along, but you have to promise me something,” Han Yunxi finally spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was so touched that she immediately agreed without asking for any details. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>go ahead and say anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come with me on a trip to the Gu Estate,” Han Yunxi smiled. Zhao </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>smile instantly stiffened on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>you...what do you want to do at the Gu Estate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though there was nothing going on between esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>and Imperial Physician Gu after the misunderstanding was cleared up last time, it would still be better if her mistress had no contact with that doctor at all! </span><i><span style>Just look at His Highness’s temper! </span></i><span style>Imperial Physician Gu had been recuperating from his severe injury. Even now, he was still on sick leave from the Imperial Physician Courtyard. It would be impossible to take him along to the disaster area, so what other reason could Han Yunxi have to see him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi grabbed a random fruit and tossed it at Zhao </span><i><span style>mama. </span></i><span style>“You’re not young anymore, so why do you still have so much nonsense in that brain? What could ever happen between Imperial Physician Gu and myself?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s right. I like Long Feiye a lot. Why would I be interested in other men?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>felt greatly wronged. “Mistress, then why are you looking for him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll know if you go with me,” Han Yunxi said mysteriously. Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>felt helpless, but could only agree. Of course, she knew they had to hide the facts from His Highness Duke of Qin. Su Xiaoyu listened to them both as she watched from the sidelines, her eyes spinning in thought like a crafty fox.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Yu’er, tell the kitchens to prepare some rations for a journey. And also, tell Steward Luo to prepare some tea leaves. Just say that His Highness and I are planning to take a long trip in three days’ time.” After leaving instructions with the child, Han Yunxi and Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>set off for the Gu Estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Xiaoyu finished her tasks very quickly. Taking advantage of the fact that Han Yunxi and Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>were both away from Leisurely Cloud Pavilion, she found an excuse to slip out of the estate. She was a deviously clever little child, with a prudent and cautious nature. As soon as she left the Duke of Qin’s estate, she went to multiple shops and bought a few snacks, before circling around various alleyways to make sure no one was tailing her. When she was sure the coast was clear, she wandered into a long alleyway and entered a very ordinary looking house. The rooms were very dark inside, enough to scare any child, but Su Xiaoyu was very happy. She literally skipped her way through the shadows until it got too dark for her to see before her hands. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With a grin, she shouted, “Master, come out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her lively personality was completely different from her conduct at the Duke of Qin’s estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there any news?” a low voice replied before someone shifted in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t that easy. That woman has a strange hobby. She doesn’t let anyone serve her when it comes to bathing or changing clothes for bed.” Su Xiaoyu mocked, and went on before the other could ask, “Furthermore, she doesn’t even sleep in the same place as His Highness Duke of Qin. Both of them live in separate houses. I only caught them sleeping together once, and it was when His Highness Duke of Qin went to her place. Master, I strongly suspect that woman and the Duke of Qin still haven’t done </span><i><span style>this and that </span></i><span style>yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a soft cough from the figure in the shadows, almost as if he choked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, they’re going on a long trip in three days’ time. If I can’t go with them, what then?” That was Su Xiaoyu’s main motive for visiting today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to rush. We can afford to wait,” the man in the shadows said mildly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if that’s the case, master, we still have to think of something! It’s not easy to grab a chance to see her body. I’m willing to bet that even His Highness Duke of Qin’s never seen her in the bare flesh!” As Su Xiaoyu spoke, she suddenly grinned. “Master, why don’t you go try instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice of the man turned cold. “Then why would I need you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Yu’er can help create a chance for master! Little Yu’er can accept it if Han Yunxi becomes our mistress.” Su Xiaoyu was still grinning cheekily, not at all afraid of her master. She was different from other people, because master had picked her up as an orphan and personally raised her up. Even master’s own little sister didn’t know she existed. Anyone who tried to look into her past would find nothing but an orphan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now the man’s voice grew stern. “Enough of that already! If Han Yunxi really is the person we’re looking for, your words today would be a gross disrespect!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Su Xiaoyu became well-behaved and fell silent with a pout. She wasn’t very clear on what Master Chu was trying to verify, but she only knew the person he was looking for was someone inexpressibly honored and revered. It was someone that master and his whole family--nay, his entire clan--had sworn loyalty to. If Han Yunxi was that person, then she would have a unique phoenix plume birthmark by her tailbone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have at least three years, so there’s no rush. You mustn’t hit the grass and startle the snake, understand?” the man spoke seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh…” Su Xiaoyu said docilely. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m asking you, </span><i><span style>do you understand?” </span></i><span style>the man said unhappily. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Xiaoyu immediately woke herself up and replied loudly, “Your subordinate understands! Your subordinate definitely won’t disappoint you, master. Please set your cares at rest!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Su Xiaoyu left the darkened room, the man in the shadows slipped away through a side door as well. His features were hazy, but he had lofty shoulders and an ebony wood bow slung across his back. Carved into the handle of the bow was an image of a phoenix reviving itself from the flames. Who else would be carrying such a bow besides Western Zhou’s Chu Tianyin of the Chu Clan?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Emperor Tianhui and Western Zhou’s emperor had already settled on a marriage alliance with Chu Qingge, but news of the engagement was still unknown to the public. Everyone had assumed that Chu Tianyin was already back in Western Zhou with Chu Qingge and Duanmu Baiye, but he had been in the capital city the entire time. Meanwhile, Su Xiaoyu had returned to the Duke of Qin’s estate, but Han Yunxi and Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>were still out.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what is Han Yunxi planning to do at the Gu Estate?</span></i><span style> Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>didn’t know, but Han Yunxi had already sent people to secretly deliver medicine to Gu Beiyue twice. Since she was leaving three days later, was she going to bid him farewell?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No. She wanted to ask him for a huge favor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lil Thing saved Gu Beiyue’s life that day, it’d been stuck in a state between slumber and wakefulness. Whenever it was conscious, all it did was eat and eat until it fell asleep again. Lil Thing was now very weak, so it needed large amounts of time and food to recover. Han Yunxi wished she could simply take Lil Thing into her detox system, but it had rejected Lil Thing because it didn’t recognize the toxin in its teeth. Because of that, Lil Thing hadn’t been classified as a poison, and thus couldn’t enter the system. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi would undoubtedly be very busy after she set off to the disaster areas, which meant there’d be no time to take care of Lil Thing. After thinking it over, she could only arrange to leave him with Gu Beiyue without worries. Gu Beiyue’s injuries had just about healed when she arrived. He was only a little weak. Han Yunxi gave him a big pile of poisons before carefully taking Lil Thing out of her pouch. Lil Thing was huddled up into a ball as it slept sweetly, just like a newborn baby. If it knew it was leaving its master, it’d definitely feel sad. But if it knew it was staying with its favorite white-robed gentleman, then it wouldn’t want to sleep at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll leave it to you!” Han Yunxi may have looked frank and straightforward, but she was quite reluctant to part with Lil Thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Beiyue’s pale-faced smile still carried its usual hint of an April spring breeze. “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>don’t worry. The things you entrust to my care, I’ll protect with my life.”</span></p>
