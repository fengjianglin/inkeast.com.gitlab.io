 <p style="text-align: left;">Chapter <span style>656: Defeat her with one move</span><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao was standing outside the doors of Long Feiye’s side estate in Yaoshui Prefecture early that morning, surrounded by a veritable crowd of onlookers. Long Feiye’s estate here wasn’t located in the city, but in the back of a quiet and peaceful lane. Its location was exceptionally lowkey and hard to notice, so it was all Duanmu Yao’s fault that so many people were here today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had not only exposed the location of his estate, but brought many of her own people to mix in amongst the crowd. Their purpose here was to act as human megaphones and spruce up rumors in case Han Yunxi slipped up and said the wrong thing. News of her flubs would spread all over Cloud Realm Continent. Moreover, Duanmu Yao had appointed select members to spread the news to Celestial Mountain itself as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She not only wanted to smear Han Yunxi’s name for the sword sect master, but to everyone else on Celestial Mountain too! She’d make it so that the woman found it impossible to ever visit the peak! Before she found out that Han Yunxi had murdered her mother, Duanmu Yao had already been looking for ways to ruin her reputation. Now she wasn’t going to hold back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Han Yunxi and the rest were standing atop the tallest pavilion inside the courtyard. From here, they couldn’t see Duanmu Yao, but the crowds of people behind her were as clear as day. Long Feiye and Han Yunxi stood in the center. One was dressed in black robes and had a pair of cold, lofty brows framing a handsome face. The other wore a pink-purple dress filled with elegance and unmatched deportment. Gu Beiyue sat his his wheelchair on Long Feiye’s left, looking like the hue of rosy morning clouds, slim and graceful as jade. Gu Qi Sha stood on Han Yunxi’s right, covered in black robes that made him mysterious. Next to him was Mu Linger dressed in bright red robes, lively and sharp. Chu Xifeng stood at attention behind his master at a respectful distance, his hand resting over his sword in an extremely deferential manner. As a group, they made for a breathtaking sight on the terrace, more beautiful than any garden full of flowers. Unfortunately, all of them wore unpleasant expressions, especially Long Feiye himself. He was a lover of peace and silence and loathed the sight of such a disturbance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi observed the surrounding roofs and buildings. They seemed unoccupied, but she knew plenty of spectators had still shown up. After such a fuss and common knowledge that her fighting skills paled in comparison to Duanmu Yao’s, she knew that most of the people here were waiting to see her make a laughingstock of herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qi She stood on the railings with dim eyes. “Poison lass, this old man will go teach her a lesson first. I’ll break her hands and feet before you fight her one on one!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was he joking? </span></i><span style>Aside from Mu Linger, no one present laugh. There was still half a stick of incense’s worth of time left before Duanmu Yaos’ appointed time arrived. He looked back and said, “Poison lass, if you don’t answer, this old man will assumed that you agree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want me to admit my guilt?” Han Yunxi rolled her eyes at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you’ve kill the woman, just admit it. As if His Highness Duke of Qin would be afraid of the Western Zhou imperial clan?” Gu Qi Sha retorted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was he here to provoke people? </span></i><span style>Long Feiye was already giving him a cold glare. He didn’t speak or make any moves, but shifted his glance towards Mu Linger. Immediately, Gu Qi Sha shut up. He dreaded the threat in Long Feiye’s eyes, but had no idea that this matter wasn’t simply a case of Long Feiye and Han Yunxi antagonizing Western Zhou if they admitted their guilt. Gu Qi Sha knew nothing of Duanmu Yao’s support from Celestial Mountain, nor what that entailed for their group. Long Feiye and Han Yunxi hadn’t mentioned any of those details. It wasn’t just Gu Qi Sha who was still in the dark, but Gu Beiyue as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon enough, the appointed time arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye naturally accompanied Han Yunxi outside. Gu Qi Sha and Mu Linger hurried to follow, while Gu Beiyue had said, “Esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei, </span></i><span style>it’s inconvenient for this one to move about, so I won’t come out. Please be careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, it’s just a trifling affair,” Han Yunxi smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before they left, Long Feiye tossed back, “Chu Xifeng, send Doctor Gu back to rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qi Sha only felt doubtful. </span><i><span style>This doesn’t seem like Gu Beiyue’s usual style? And when did Long Feiye grow so considerate for others’ sakes? Just what happened between those two in the days I was gone? </span></i><span style>Still, he was in a rush to catch up and didn’t think more of it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Long Feiye be so considerate? The only thing he’d consider in this lifetime was probably his sweetheart…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He told Chu Xifeng to escort Gu Beiyue away because the man was to help him get in contact with Chu Tianyin. He hadn’t helped Han Yunxi outwardly with her matters, but had given the matter plenty of care in the background. Meanwhile, the crowd outside was growing rowdy as the challenge time arrived. But Han Yunxi didn’t give them time to reproach her before she flung open the doors! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd immediately quieted down as if doused with a bucket of ice water. Duanmu Yao immediately pointed her sword at Han Yunxi in fury. “Han Yunxi, what grudge did you ever bear against my </span><i><span style>mufei </span></i><span style>to kill her personally? If I don’t kill you today, how is she supposed to rest in peace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She even ignored the man who’d come out with Han Yunxi and stabbed forwards with her weapon. “Slut, hand over your life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the threat drew near, Han Yunxi remained calm. She didn’t budge, but stood with arms crossed. The crowd watching them forgot all about Duanmu Yao’s sword, sucked in by the queenly air surrounding the elegant Han Yunxi. Her noble air was elegant and impossible to overlook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao’s gaze turned sinister when she realized that Han Yunxi wasn’t planning to dodge. Her foot pushed off the ground before she put on a burst of speed and rushed forward like a streak of light. It was almost too fast for human eyes to follow her movement, much less react in time! Everyone knew she was a disciple of the sword sect master with consummate sword skills, but never expected her to be so formidable. In a flash, the tip of her sword was already at Han Yunxi’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s over!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The minds of the crowd grew blank. Everyone had expected Long Feiye to stop the attack, but even he wouldn’t have time to do that now! And yet, a marvel suddenly happened. Long Feiye didn’t attack, but Duanmu Yao retreated! She could have killed Han Yunxi, but she was now backing away. In a flash, she’d backtracked ten steps and tottered in place before crumping to the ground and spitting up a mouthful of black blood.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What...just happened?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Now the crowd was flabbergasted. Even Gu Qi Sha and Mu Linger were left dumbstruck. Long Feiye hadn’t done anything, so what did Han Yunxi do? When did she turn so powerful? Upon closer observation, everyone finally noticed the single needle resting in a corner of Han Yunxi’s mouth. It wasn’t any of her usual medical needles, but an assassination weapon dipped in poison and gleaming with a dark luster. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial arts experts in the crowd immediately understood. Han Yunxi certainly was both sly and brave. She allowed Duanmu Yao to get close so she could attack the girl with poison needles. Faced with this, Duanmu Yao could either chose to die with her together, or retreat from the assault. If she hadn’t backed away just then, Han Yunxi’s remaining needles would have certainly taken her life. Meanwhile, the sudden withdrawal would only allow her built up sword </span><i><span style>qi </span></i><span style>to backlash on her own body, thus attacking herself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao didn’t have the nerve to risk a mutual death, so she’d retreated purely out of self-preservation instincts. Her black blood proved that her internal injuries were quite serious. Actually, she was already injured, so today’s backlash only intensified her wounds! If this was a oneshot match, then Han Yunxi’s move had already won the challenge. With Duanmu Yao’s current condition, she would be no match for her Pear Blossom Teardrop Rain bracelet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After processing the results, the crowd was dumbfounded. They didn’t expect such an outcome between the two woman. Hadn’t the match barely started? Why was it already over? Can Han Yunxi please stop scaring them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi looked scornfully down at Duanmu Yao with her needle in her mouth, her free and easy attitude every inch the equal of a man’s. Her looks were first rate, but her aura and style were completely matchless. Gu Qi Sha and Mu Linger were still gaping. Neither of them expected Han Yunxi to be so...so...</span><i><span style>fierce!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, someone shouted out from the crowd. “Han Yunxi was shameless! She used poisoned! That’s so low.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi narrowed her eyes and looked towards the source of the voice. “Who said that? If you have the guts, show yourself to this </span><i><span style>wangfei!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Her voice awed the speechless crowd into further silence. But someone had the nerve to really stand out--a girl about fourteen to fifteen years old. Her clothes were unremarkable, but she was one of Duanmu Yao’s assigned speakers in the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did!” the girl declared proudly, hints of Duanmu Yao in her tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do mine and Duanmu Yao’s matters have to do with you? Wha are you?” Han Yunxi asked coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words struck the girl dumb. It was a while before she stammered back. “I’m...I’m just speaking out on behalf of injustice towards Miss Duanmu! Is...isn’t that allowed? Do you have a guilty conscience?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s unfair about this?” Han Yunxi retorted. She hadn’t wanted to fight Duanmu Yao today on anything beyond words. If the woman was going to smear her, then she’d stamp out any chances for her to seize an advantage. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You used poison! Just then, you poisoned Miss Duanmu!” the girl insisted stubbornly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What kind of reasoning is that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi laughed. “Who said poison wasn’t allowed? Who--”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The poison arts are from a heretical and crooked way. They only hurt people and are held in contempt by people of righteous sects, as well as being a taboo of Medical City! You’re despicable and shameless for using such a wicked technique against Miss Duanmu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi lost her temper. “She clearly knew that this </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>only knows poison arts, not martial arts, yet this personal disciple of the great Celestial Mountain Sword Sect’s master called me out by name to challenge me on my doorstep. If I’m not allowed to use poison after all this, isn’t that...base and shameless beyond belief?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She almost wanted to laugh at the ridiculousness of the claim, and gave a cold snort at the woman still sprawled on the ground. “Duanmu Yao, if you can’t afford to lose, then don’t come in the first place!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao had been counterattacked by her own sword </span><i><span style>qi </span></i><span style>and was now hurting from her very organs. All of her </span><i><span style>qi </span></i><span style>passages had been blocked, leaving her catching for breath. Han Yunxi’s words only sent her internal </span><i><span style>qi </span></i><span style>spiraling madly again, driving her to the point of insanity. She used her sword to prop herself off the ground. “Where did I lose?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, it’s fine if I use poison and assassination weapons?” Han Yunxi asked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Duanmu Yao knew the state of her internal injuries better than anyone else. Her current state was no match for any of the Tang Clan’s hidden weapons. In fact, she was still trying to regain her senses. How could she...how could she have been injured so badly? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duanmu Yao, do you admit defeat? Or shall we continue?” Han Yunxi asked coldly. Although she hadn’t planned to accept the single match or admit to any guilt, Duanmu Yao had started attacked her as soon as she showed up. She had to demand a victor and loser if that was the case!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is she so great just because she’s the disciple of Celestial Mountain Sword Sect’s grandmaster?</span></i></p>
