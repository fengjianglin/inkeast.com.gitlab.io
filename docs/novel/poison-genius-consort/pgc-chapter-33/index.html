 <p>Chapter 33: Savior, just wait obediently&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the room, Han Yunxi had just inserted the first needle. Although she didn’t want to, she could still hear the argument happening outside. At this critical juncture, anyone rushing into the room would make things more difficult. They’d definitely accuse her of an assassination attempt! And yet she still had to urgently dispel the poison, while her needles could only be inserted one-by-one. </span><i><span style>General Mu, you absolutely have to hold them back!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Disregarding the growing sweat by her temples, Han Yunxi gritted her teeth and refocused her efforts, inserting the second needle. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the North Court Official’s words, the officers drew forward one after the other. General Mu knitted his brows before he couldn’t take any more and unsheathed his sword. “Come, protect the young general!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When his words fell, a squadron a soldiers appeared from one side, each holding a spear in their hands. Upon seeing this, He Ze of the Northern Court drew out a cold breath and demanded, “General Mu, what is the meaning of this? Are you mobilizing your troops?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, everyone else stood stupefied, not expecting the general to act this way. Though there was saying called, </span><i><span style>‘A general in the field is not bound by orders from his sovereign,’ </span></i><span style>General Mu was still residing in the capital. Without the emperor’s orders, he couldn’t move any troops. The soldiers under his personal command could only be stationed outside the capital, leaving him with a handful in his residence to serve as guards. How could soldiers face off against officers and attendants? Especially against He Ze of the Northern Court, who’d received arrest orders? A sufficient reason was needed to deploy any troops. If General Mu disobeyed the empress dowager’s decree like this, wouldn’t that be considered a public rebellion?</span></p>
 <p><span style>General Mu was very clear on the consequences of his actions, but he’d throw everything to the winds for the sake of his son’s life!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“General Mu, I’m arresting someone because of my orders. You dare gather these troops to resist me, are you really planning to revolt?” The North Court Official asked sternly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father!” Suddenly, Mu Liuyue cried out. “Father, please calm down!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the household steward and chamberlain had also grown nervous. They never expected events to progress to this state. Even if it was for the young general’s sake, the old general calling out troops for his son like this would only be pretext for gossip! If the emperor got word of this, then punishment for rebellion, especially that of military officers, would be the nine familial exterminations[1]! How many people were waiting to exploit the weaknesses of the general’s house in this capital?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing his own family call him that way finally calmed General Mu down. He gave an ugly glare towards He Ze of the Northern Court as grief rose in his heart. This was the sorrow of an official, his weakest point. No matter how highly the emperor placed him, if he resisted the authorities or called upon troops without any reason, he’d meet with death. There wouldn’t be room for any discussion. A general in the capital during peacetime was one of its most powerless men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>General Mu hatefully relinquished his sword while his soldiers were forced to retreat. Seeing this, the North Court Official was very pleased. A single glance had his officers taking General Mu prisoner. Though he could easily resist them, he was helpless in his identity as general. They brought him to one side while the North Court Official spoke as a small man intoxicated by his success. “General Mu, don’t worry. After we’ve found Han Yunxi, this official wouldn’t dare accuse you of harboring a criminal. I’ll say that you assisted greatly in delivering her to justice! Heheh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>General Mu was so angry that he could grind his teeth to dust. He shot a glare at the North Court Official, before shouting mournfully at the princess. “Princess Changping, Qingwu really is poisoned! Han Yunxi didn’t misdiagnose him. But it’s crucial to treat the poison immediately, and she’s trying to save Qingwu’s life right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Changping wouldn’t believe in a useless trash like Han Yunxi. “You’ve been possessed by some spirit, haven’t you? What kind of nonsense are you saying?” She raised her voice next. “Imperial physician, come! Find the imperial physician, where is he?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The North Court Official lowered his eyes and something cold flashed through them. The empress dowager had given him secret orders to take away Han Yunxi’s life with this opportunity. It was good that she’d come here, because she’d be a perfect fit as a murderer. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come! Hack through that lock on the door!” the North Court Official said suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>BANG!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Such a loud noise gave Han Yunxi a fright. Her hand holding the needle shook for the first time. A few more were in her other palm, but her hands were trembling like her heart as the distinct sounds of people removing the lock came from outside the door. By the next instant, they’d be pushing it open and coming inside! Right now, Han Yunxi’s delicate, pretty face was drawn, her eyes downcast as her lips pursed in a solemn frigidity. One of her hands continued to insert the needles while the other took out the dagger that Mu Qingwu always kept by his side and held it in her own hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She only needed ten more minutes to expel all the poison and decided to press her luck. If someone tried to stop her, then she’d take Mu Qingwu hostage with this dagger and have them try to stop her! Time flowed on, but Han Yunxi quickly discovered that no other sounds followed the noise of removing the lock from the door. There was only silence, but still nobody came inside.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This...what happened?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was so quiet outside that it sounded like no one was even moving. Exactly what was going on? Han Yunxi couldn’t figure it out and decided to stop thinking. Nothing was better than something at this point, and she still needed to expel the poisons with her needles! Without further interference, her concentration was much better than before. Her speed improved as well as needle after needle sank neatly into corresponding acupoints. In a short period of time, Mu Qingwu’s injury was covered in over 20 odd needles. His fair white skin slowly turned red, then darker and darker until red became black.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was delighted at the sight, because the poison was being drawn out at last. She took out another needle just as a series of loud proclamations carried rang through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“May His Highness Duke of Qin live for thousands and thousands of years!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Uh…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi’s hand turned stiff. Her focus had always been exceptional so that nothing short of the extraordinary could ever distract her. But this time, the announcement made her turn around.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Duke of Qin!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Her groom and husband, Long Feiye?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heavens, had he come? So that’s why everyone was so quiet?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did he come? What did he come here to do?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did he come back with ingredients for his antidote so quickly?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Well, none of these were important. What was most important was that with this godly figure here, she’d be safe. Definitely safe. Han Yunxi really wanted to say, </span><i><span style>Long Feiye, you’re this girl’s destined savior!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>With Long Feiye here, Han Yunxi could be certain that she was okay. No matter what they said outside, she could completely ignore it and focus on treating Mu Qingwu’s poison instead. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, everyone outside was kneeling on the ground. Even Princess Changping was half-bowing without daring to look up, while the long lovestruck Mu Liuyue was kneeling in the very back, completely senseless as her eyes roved about Long Feiye like they were the only two people left on Earth. She’d long pushed everyone else and their affairs to the back of her mind. Many of the officers and bodyguards here had never seen Long Feiye in person before, but each of them trembled in fear as they lowered their heads, both excited and terrified. They all wanted to look, but didn’t dare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This man was like a god!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye stepped casually before the door, his tall, straight figure like a mountain etched with harsh lines. His features were cut as finely as a knife, giving him the appearance of a lofty sovereign who carried the vastness of the skies within his gaze. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You may all rise,” he said, voice cold and unyielding. One after another, the figures rose to their feet, though most of them were too fearful to raise their heads. When Long Feiye had chased after Han Yunxi, he’d ended up watching and listening to everything from the roof until he had a rough idea of what had happened. Now his cold gaze bore through He Ze of the Northern Court. “North Court Official, when did Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>become a fugitive? Why doesn’t your lordship know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He Ze of the Northern Court shivered. He met Long Feiye’s gaze and instantly lowered his head again, feeling as if he’d been plunged into an icehouse. A fugitive was someone who had already been locked up in prison. The Duke of Qin was asking him why no one had asked for his permission before capturing the person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To...to reply Your Highness[2] Duke of Qin, this is...this is...the arrest warrant was issued by the empress dowager.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Changping wasn’t a sufficient enough explanation, so all he could do was pile it onto the highest authority available. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you’re using the empress dowager to suppress your lordship?” Long Feiye’s icy tone grew three times colder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Terrified, the North Court Official fell to his knees. “It’s a mistake, </span><i><span style>ah, </span></i><span style>a misunderstanding! Your highness, this humble official wouldn’t dare to do that even if I had a hundred heads! The situation’s like this: an assassin attacked the young general and his guards found him when he was already unconscious. Everyone saw Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>take out a dagger aimed towards his stomach! Later Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei </span></i><span style>said she could treat him. Unfortunately, he still isn’t well after all this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“General Mu, is this true?” Long Feiye’s cool gaze moved to the general next. The irascible general’s temper had long faded in the presence of the Duke of Qin. He only replied </span><i><span style>‘yes’ </span></i><span style>in a low tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what is the situation now?” Long Feiye asked again. General Mu seemed to hesitate, as if not knowing what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak!” Long Feiye suddenly turned angry, scaring all the people present into trembling. General Mu shook the hardest of all before noisily kowtowing three times on the ground. He explained everything systematically and in full detail, including waiting for Mu Qingwu’s poison to flare up again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In short, you arrested someone without reason. And now that that person is trying to save a life, you want to stop her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No no! Your highness, the empress dowager is just being prudent. After all...after all, there’s suspicions around Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei, </span></i><span style>so I was ordered to lock her up first and invite another imperial physician over for diagnosis.” the North Court Official explained hastily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, that’s right! Imperial Uncle Qin, imperial grandmother dotes on the imperial aunt, but things have to be done according to official regulations so rumors won’t spread! Besides, Han Yunxi still hasn’t woke up Qingwu </span><i><span style>gege </span></i><span style>yet. Everyone knows she’s the Han Family’s useless trash, so who can trust her medical skills? Imperial Uncle Qin, you should take a look inside for us first, what if…” Before Princess Changping could finish, she caught Long Feiye’s frigid eyes and meekly shut her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye folded his arms behind his back and unexpectedly nodded. “</span><i><span style>Un, </span></i><span style>indeed...we have to do things according to official regulations.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, both the North Court Official and Princess Changping released a breath. Princess Changping knew</span> <span style>that Han Yunxi was just some woman lower than a servant in the Imperial Uncle Qin’s eyes. He probably loathed her to the extreme, so why would he protect her? As the atmosphere relaxed, the North Court Official timidly spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke of Qin, why don’t, we let the imperial physician inside, in case…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Long Feiye abruptly cut him off. “If by chance, you alarm her and disturb the poison treatment process, can the North Court Official bear responsibility?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>To take responsibility for the young general’s life? And for Qin </span><i><span style>Wangfei’s </span></i><span style>life? The North Court Official was so terrified that he could feel his gall bladder splitting. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness Duke of Qin! This old official believes in esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei! </span></i><span style>Just let esteemed </span><i><span style>wangfei </span></i><span style>treat him herself!” General Mu said earnestly. With the help from Gu Beiyue’s reminder, he was more suspicious of the doctors brought by Princess Changping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye never moved from the door, but swept his icy gaze across all the people present. “Does anyone else want to go in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both the North Court Official and Mu Liuyue shot careful looks at Princess Changping. Of course she wanted to go in, but she didn’t have the nerve!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since there’s nobody else, then I’ll have to trouble the North Court Official to wait awhile,” Long Feiye said lightly.</span></p>
