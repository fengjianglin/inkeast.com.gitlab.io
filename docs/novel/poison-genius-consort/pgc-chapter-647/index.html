 <p style="text-align: left;">Chapter <span style>647: Master is a pitiful figure too</span><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style>The past…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye responded accordingly. “I didn’t stay long on Celestial Mountain. Before I turned 18, I used to go once a year, but that grew less often as I aged. It’s been three or four years since I’ve gone back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi didn’t speak beyond staring at him with narrowed eyes. Long Feiye knew that he’d answered the crucial part of her question then. He didn’t know how hard it was to placate other woman, but he knew he couldn’t afford to be careless with this one. Either she’d ask him nothing at all, or smash everything apart to question him until the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Every time I went up the mountain, I received master’s instruction before closing myself in for cultivation. As soon as I finished, I left,” Long Feiye added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haven’t you gone up and down the mountain with her in the past? You even escorted her back to Western Zhou’s capital city, didn’t you?” Han Yunxi asked viciously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn’t usually so narrow-minded, but Long Feiye was her one exception. When it came to him, she was extremely petty and refused to accept a single blemish. This man could only belong wholly to her! She refused to share a bit of him, whether it was past, present, or future. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye only looked at her with a helpless smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you smiling about?!” Han Yunxi was almost choking to death from rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring her cry, Long Feiye only went to hail the driver. “Go order some dishes first. A plate of vinegar-soaked cabbage sounds good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was now both enraged </span><i><span style>and </span></i><span style>embarrassed. She kicked at him and cried, “Long Feiye, I’m not joking with you here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still worried about what Duanmu Baiye said in the past?” Long Feiye didn’t know whether to cry or laugh. Back at Western Zhou, that man had tried to provoke them with his words, but he’d already explained himself. But here she was, calling up old debts again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then...then did you master always used to order you to take care of her in the past? And did you go then?” That was the main sore spot for Han Yunxi. Last time Duanmu Yao had come on the sword sect master’s orders to seek out Long Feiye. He’d promptly followed her without a word, which was enough proof of his master’s importance in his heart. Judging by the letter they received, it wasn’t the first time the old man had made demands of Long Feiye. Heaven knows how many orders he’d given in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye looked at her with a complicated expression and didn’t reply. Han Yunxi returned the look as she waited, but no answer was forthcoming. Her anger dissipated in the wake of her fast beating heart as she knitted her eyebrows nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me!” The more anxious she felt, the harsher she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened in the past…” Long Feiye finally spoke, but Han Yunxi was quick to muffle him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough! If it’s in the past, let it pass. I’m hungry so let’s eat.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The heart of a woman was like a needle at the bottom of the sea. Her face was more changeable than a child’s or weather on a June day. It switched at the drop of a hat! </span></p>
 <p><span style>She was about to step off the carriage herself when Long Feiye hugged her from behind and pulled her into his arms. “Heheh, not angry anymore?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why not?” he asked with interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead, Han Yunxi blurted out, “Long Feiye, I’m scared!” She turned to face him in earnest. “Long Feiye, I’m afraid that I’ll never be able to erase your past no matter how hard I try. I’m worried that I won’t be your one and only. Tell me, what should I do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She never trusted anyone but herself. Whenever difficulties came her way, she would do her best until she surmounted them! But she was helpless when it came to his past. What he experienced was something out of her bounds. She couldn’t stop him from doting on others if he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How helpless it all was! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye’s heart trembled slightly at her words before he held her tighter. If possible, he’d want to absorb all of her into himself. This was probably the most emotional confession he’d ever heard. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She allowed him to hold tight as she confessed, “I object to it…I object a lot. Long Feiye, what should we do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With any other man, she might have excused it. She was a free and easy soul, after all. But he was someone she couldn’t simply forget. The more she thought about the possibilities, the more horrible she felt. He rubbed her back gently and asked, “You this greedy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi’s reply was quite pathetic. “That’s right. It’s a shame...that I can’t covet what I don’t have.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye was torn between heartache and humor. He’d never seen her so listless. Burying his face by her ear until he was almost close enough to bite her, he whispered back, word by word, “Han Yunxi, remember this. Your lordship will only have and serve one woman in this life, and that’s you. Regardless of the past or future, it’ll only be you. There won’t be a second.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He drew back after that, only to stop and lean close again so he could cup her face in his hands. Then he gave her a firm kiss on the lips--their special “stamping” method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi’s world lit up. Instead of feeling timid, she grew energized and recovered her spirits instantly. Her hands held his face as well before she started pestering him for details. “What other things has your master ordered you to do in the past?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t remember them,” Long Feiye was telling the truth. Would he bother keeping a memory of those times?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Think about it a bit more,” Han Yunxi’s heart itched. She wouldn’t be able to sleep without some straight answers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Probably about the same things as the contents of that letter.” Long Feiye had no desire to recall the past. Once Han Yunxi was sure he’d really forgotten, she felt quiet satisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s good that you forgot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing these words, Long Feiye realized that she’d set a trap for him. If he had really remembered anything, the consequences could have been damning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how did you refuse the requests?” Han Yunxi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By overtly agreeing while covertly opposing.” He would never reject any request in his master’s face, but he never really followed those instructions in private. For example, when master had told him to take care of Duanmu Yao until she turned 18, he only made sure she didn’t die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wouldn’t Duanmu Yao tattle?” Han Yunxi was bewildered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye shook her head, so she asked, “Why not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sure.” Now Long Feiye was starting to get impatient. Han Yunxi stopped while she was ahead and started wondering about something more important instead. “Why does the sword sect master dote on Duanmu Yao so much? It shouldn’t just be because she has excellent natural talents, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, Long Feiye was superior to her in every aspect. So why wouldn’t the sword sect master dote on him instead of asking him to wait on Duanmu Yao instead? There had to be a secret there. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye was planning to tell Han Yunxi more things slowly once they went to Celestial Mountain themselves, but since she’d already asked, he didn’t plan to hide the facts any longer. After all, the fact that he’d decided to take her up the mountain already made hiding these things pointless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duanmu Yao’s talents were very similar to my late </span><i><span style>shimu </span></i><span style>[1. </span><i><span style>shimu </span></i><span style>(师母) - a female with the same ranking as a master/</span><i><span style>shifu</span></i><span style> (师父), usually his wife. If you’ll notice, </span><i><span style>shimu </span></i><span style>has “mu” (母) for “mother” while </span><i><span style>shifu </span></i><span style>has “fu” (父) for “father” to make a pair.] </span><i><span style>Shimu...</span></i><span style>was once master’s disciple too.”[2. In other words, LFY’s master married his own disciple, thus making her LFY’s </span><i><span style>shimu </span></i><span style>even if she might not have formally taught him anything.] Long Feiye sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She was the real first disciple of my master, but that’s a secret that no one else knows. Master didn’t take disciples at all because he had </span><i><span style>shimu, </span></i><span style>but Duanmu Yao caught his eye when we both went for our tests at Celestial Mountain. Because seeing her put him in such a good mood, he accepted both of us that day under his tutelage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was surprised. The public all said that Long Feiye and Duanmu Yao were officially accepted out of the norm by the sword sect master because of their exceptional talents. Who knew that this would be the truth?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If that was the case, then Long Feiye had ridden on Duanmu Yao’s coattails to be accepted in Celestial Mountain Sword Sect all those years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even Duanmu Yao herself doesn’t know this fact. Master only told me as it was a matter that concerned his own reputation…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Long Feiye could finish, Han Yunxi declared, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely keep it secret!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cloud Realm Continent might be an open-minded society, but common customs saw romantic relationships between masters and disciples as taboo. The sword sect master was respected as a figure of noble character and high morals, so he’d be extremely condemned if news broke of his forbidden love. The entire Celestial Mountain Sword Sect would see their reputation plummeting as a result. No one would send their children to learn under their masters after that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Shimu....</span></i><span style>died because the circulation of her true </span><i><span style>qi </span></i><span style>backfired and drove her to insanity down a wrong cultivation path,” Long Feiye remarked. “After she passed away, master’s hair turned white overnight. The shock scarred him psychologically and afflicted him with fits of insanity. Though he’s managed to control himself in the past, his mental state is unsteady now. When his condition acts up, he doesn’t even know who I am, only Duanmu Yao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yunxi was stunned. She knew that Long Feiye had been hiding things about Celestial Mountain from her, but never thought that it’d be this. From what she understood, the sword sect master had gone all white when he was only around 30 years old. They said it was a result of his cultivation, but reality showed that heartbreak was to blame. For him to grow white hair overnight was a testament to how much he’d suffered from his wife’s death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, Han Yunxi’s anger towards the man all but evaporated. She suddenly understood why he’d treat Duanmu Yao so well without any further words of explanation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does Cang Qiuzi know about this?” Han Yunxi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s suspected from the way master treats Duanmu Yao, but I don’t know if he’s aware of the truth,” Long Feiye replied. “Even Tang Zijin and Tang Li don’t know about this. Only you, I, and Duanmu Yao know about his condition. When we get to Celestial Mountain, you can just pretend to be ignorant for the time being.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sword sect master only had occasional episodes of mental instability, so he’d forbidden Long Feiye and Duanmu Yao from revealing his condition to anyone. Long Feiye had only sent Tang Li up the mountain to scope out the basic news and nothing more. The sword sect master’s quarters were heavily guarded so it’d be impossible to get anything out of there. Duanmu Yao herself only knew as much as their master suffering from fits once in a while. She was still ignorant to the true cause of the condition, or how it’d stemmed from </span><i><span style>shimu’s </span></i><span style>death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye was technically breaking the rules by telling Han Yunxi at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Over the past few years, Cang Qiuzi and various factions of Celestial Mountain were getting restless, as well as the rogue factions of Carefree City and the City of Daughters. All of them wanted to gain sovereignty over Cloud Realm Continent’s martial arts circles. As the true pillar of Celestial Mountain, the sword sect master’s stability was paramount to prevent the situation from devolving into chaos!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, if the martial arts circles started fighting, there would be no considerations of country or borders to keep them in check like a war between nations. Understanding the implications, Han Yunxi said, “If that’s the case, we’ll have to soundly face off against Cang Qiuzi when we go to Celestial Mountain!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With all these factors already at play, Celestial Mountain Sword Sect couldn’t afford to entertain its own internal squabbles as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Feiye just poked her on the nose with a grin. “There’s no need for you to worry about that. Just restrain yourself and make sure not to anger master when you meet him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure to yield to him!” Han Yunxi agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style> They wouldn’t be able to avoid meeting Duanmu Yao then, but as long as the girl wasn’t too atrocious, she wouldn’t fuss either. As it turned out, she didn’t underestimate Duanmu Yao--but the extent of the sword sect master’s love and doting on the girl. When that future came, she would only regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, a complicated look flitted past Long Feiye’s eyes. Facing off against Cang Qiuzi was only secondary importance for their trip up Celestial Mountain this summer. The primary goal for him was to unlock the seal inside his body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Should I tell Han Yunxi about that too?</span></i></p>
