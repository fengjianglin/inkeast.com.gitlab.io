 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no petroleum and natural gas in the outside world anymore. If we only used solar energy, it would require a few days to travel through a radiation zone. Also, it depended on whether their spaceship was a cargo spaceship. If it couldn’t fit any cargo, it would be useless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Additionally, the larger the spaceship, the bigger the expense. It also relied on luck if it ran on solar energy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If you were lucky, it would be sunny all the time so the sun’s rays could charge the spaceship.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If you were unlucky, you ran out of energy after a few days and you had to wait for the sun to show again. Stopping in the wilderness of the radiation zone was a dangerous thing to do. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I recalled that Noah City only had one small blue crystal energy and it had kept the entire Noah City operating like a treasure. Harry and his troop could only use flying vehicles with solar energy to travel Blue Shield City. It would take at least half a month to travel back and forth, which was worrying. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was obvious that blue crystal energy was absolutely the king of all energy in this world.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Head back first. I will think about it,” the grandma told me. Seemingly distressed, she turned and looked up at the bright moon in the sky. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Who is this grandma?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She was the oldest person on Hagrid Island. I reckoned that she should be the oldest person in this world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since she was Xing Chuan’s great-grandma, she… would be alive since sixty years ago. She’d experienced the end of the world. She was the true survivor of the disaster!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She should be the only one who had survived from the end of the world until now. It was really a magical thing. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The next morning, Xing Chuan knocked on my door.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at him confusedly. He stared at me for a while before he said, “Xiao Ya isn’t in a good mental condition. You’d better take a &nbsp;look.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was stunned. “Isn’t in a good mental condition?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He furrowed his eyebrows, which made him appear like he was laden with anxiety just like the Xing Chuan in Silver Moon City, “Yeah. Actually, there were many girls who were terrified by you yesterday. They couldn’t sleep well at night.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I was shocked for a while.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">So… these princesses were terrified by me?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Heh…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” I couldn’t help but chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is not funny at all!” Xing Chuan roared unusually strictly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You have a painful and cruel past but you cannot hate us for living well!” He was angry because of what I’d said the day before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I glanced at him and humphed coldly, “Childish. You are now exposed. If you don’t work hard, the painful and cruel future is coming to you. You are still living without any sense of crisis.” I shook my head and walked past him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was too different from the Xing Chuan in Silver Moon City. He was just like a level one noob who’d just signed up for the game while Xing Chuan was already a veteran with full equipment. They weren’t just a level or two apart but two worlds apart. He followed behind me. “What do you mean?” he asked nervously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">We walked in a transparent glass tunnel with a magnificent waterfall under us. I pointed at the opening in the sky. “You are exposed. It is only a matter of time until someone discovers you. You’d better pray that it is the people in Silver Moon City who finds you. If it is the Ghost Eclipsers, they will wipe you out in an instant.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We have a defense system too! We have battle power too!” He was extremely serious as he spoke with pride. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I shook my head. “That’s nothing to the metahumans.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You exaggerated the metahumans outside!” His face was glum. “They are humans too. They have blood and flesh.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Yeah?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Hehe</span><span>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” I didn’t want to talk to him anymore.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s impossible for you to win against us without superpower!” he proclaimed loudly with confidence. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I stopped and looked at him. His solemn face looked similar to the expressionless Xing Chuan. He was stubborn too, but he was never as calm and steady as Xing Chuan who was also brutal and experienced.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Crossing my arms, I looked at him with a smile. “You made me curious and I would like to see your ability. Alright, I won’t use my superpower and I will fight with you once.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He furrowed his eyebrows. “You will get injured.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Hahaha…</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Hahaha…</span><span>” I burst out in laughter. Looking at him, I shook my head. I turned to continue forward. “Where does your confidence come from?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Hahaha…&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The young are fearless.” I found him amusing. He was quite similar to the Xing Chuan in Silver Moon City when it came to regarding himself highly. However, the other Xing Chuan wouldn’t dare to provoke me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When I arrived at Xing Ya’s bedroom, her door was open. Elena was keeping Xing Ya company. Xing Ya hugged Elena like a little child while Elena stroked Xing Ya’s long hair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan walked past me and looked at Elena gently. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Elena lifted her head. Her gentle, beautiful appearance was enough to heal any man with her smile. Elena was really beautiful. Every time I saw Elena, I felt a heavy weight on my heart. Such a woman had been consumed and turned into ashes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Was it because they were clones, so they didn’t need to appreciate their lives and had no guilt when they killed the clones? Elena got up and walked up to Xing Chuan. Xing Chuan hugged her shoulders and smiled gently at her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Ya peeped at me and lowered her gaze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go. Your brother wants to challenge me. Do you want to see?” I asked Xing Ya who looked spiritless. She was stunned. Elena stead at Xing Chuan in shock too. Xing Chuan immediately glanced at me as though he was wondering why I didn’t comfort Xing Ya.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I walked to the side of her bed and glanced at them funnily. “To triumph over fear, one shouldn’t rely on other people comforting her but instead rely on becoming stronger herself. You didn’t expect me to comfort Xing Ya, right? You might as well tell her to watch something else to redirect her attention away from the fear. Wake up, Xing Ya.” I pulled her up and dragged her to the washroom. “Look at yourself. You look ugly.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Who says that I’m ugly!” Xing Ya suddenly became energetic, “I am not ugly!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Humph</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!” Xing Ya began to wash up and I waited for her by the door. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A short while later, Xing Ya had changed her clothes and looked more energetic. Xing Chuan and Elena were less worried too.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I glanced at Xing Chuan. “Where to?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Elena furrowed her eyebrows at Xing Chuan while he looked serious. “Follow me.” He walked at the front with Elena. Elena was his wife and she would be the Queen in the future.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you really want to compete with my brother? Without superpower?” Xing Ya looked extremely surprised. “My brother is very good with the sword!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Ya and I followed behind Xing Chuan and Elena. Elena glanced at Xing Chuan with her eyebrows tightly knitted. “Don’t hurt Luo Bing. She is only an ordinary girl when she is not using her superpower.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know,” Xing Chuan said politely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I couldn’t help but laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I glanced at Xing Ya. “We have to place a bet. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fun.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You want to place a bet?!” Xing Ya puffed up her cheeks. “You are definitely going to lose. What do you have to offer my brother?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I gave her a smile. “I don’t have to give him anything because he’s losing for sure. I’d like to see what I should ask from him.” I didn’t seem to have anything to ask for.</span></p>
