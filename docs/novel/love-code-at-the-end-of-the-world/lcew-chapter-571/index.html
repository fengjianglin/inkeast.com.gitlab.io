 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie seemed angry too. He crossed his arms in the water cabin, angry that I had suddenly taken action alone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In their eyes, it was far too dangerous to fight against a Ghost King alone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It really had been dangerous. If it wasn’t because my blood was ‘poisonous’, I would have been dead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But I really hadn’t been able to hold myself back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That woman, that bloody piece of meat, that pool of fresh young men’s blood, I hadn't been able to help it! There’d been no way I could have stayed calm and flirted with her while I made a strategic plan. I’d only wanted that woman to immediately disappear before me!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I didn’t start a battle,” I said faintly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How dare you say you didn’t?!” Raffles roared. He scanned my body with a medic device. “You killed a Ghost King alone. Do you know how dangerous that is?!!” Raffles bellowed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You killed a Ghost King?!” He Lei was stunned. Then, he realized, “You killed Margaery?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!” Raffles’ face darkened in anger. He glanced at He Lei and complained, “He didn’t discuss with us at all and simply took action alone to kill Margaery. Even Gehenna had no idea. Now, the beautiful young men in Margaery’s spacecraft are smashing the spacecraft to vent their anger and hatred!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He Lei continued to be dumbfounded. His expression seemed complicated, as if he didn’t know if he should cry or laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Everything is normal.” Ice Dragon’s image suddenly appeared before us. He smiled and stood by the side like a butler. “He lost some blood but that’s it. According to the scan, Master is recovering really fast. His blood count is recovering quickly. He can have some blood production agent to help his recovery.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie nodded continuously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles quickly fetched a blood production agent and injected it in my neck.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Ah</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t act alone if you are scared of pain!” Raffles was really angry and sternly scolded me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So, the explosions were Margaery’s men smashing the spacecraft?” Seeing that I was doing alright, He Lei calmed down again</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Smashing… spacecraft…” Raffles was stunned. He finally recalled and turned anxious. “What should we do? The spacecraft will be ruined…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain! Pelos found Wheelock.” Ice Dragon shared the screen that Blue Feather had sent. “Connect Pelos.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pelos’ image immediately appeared in the medic cabin. Uncle Akbu was right next to him, and the uncle with a loud voice was by their side too.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Really manly…” Uncle Wheelock measured me up and down in shock. Pelos had obviously told them something beforehand. They were astonished by my manly appearance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He Lei looked confused when he saw Uncle Wheelock’s expression. He then glanced at me too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I returned his look. “He Lei, the control room can’t be left empty.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He Lei understood. He nodded and quickly disappeared before me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I turned to Uncle Wheelock. “Uncle Wheelock, please send a message on my behalf.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Alright.” Once Uncle Wheelock agreed, I saw Uncle Akbu and Pelos put on noise isolation earphones simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Facing him seriously, I said, “I am the person who killed the Bloody Queen.” I paused. I suddenly remembered that I had yet to figure out my Ghost Eclipser name. The name Luo Bing was too well known now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am the person who killed the Bloody Queen.” Suddenly, a loud voice resounded like a speaker, spreading my voice to every corner. I could even hear it clearly in the medic cabin and it was even in my voice!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Coming back to reality, I continued, “I know that you only want to vent your hatred, fear and anger… But now, what’s most important is that you should bury your dead relatives, friends, comrades so they can rest in peace…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As my loud voice reverberated in the air, Mary became quiet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I nodded and thanked Uncle Wheelock. Overwhelmed by my response, he bowed at me in reverence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the screen, Mary was quiet. The people in there were no longer smashing the spacecraft but instead were as quiet as frightened bunnies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I told Gehenna to return and gave Mary space. Only the uncles in Koont Village remained watching nearby in silence. For people who’d been frightened, the uncles in Koont Village would give them a sense of security.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a long while, I saw Moro and Eletta come out slowly from Mary. Eletta hid behind Moto and looked around carefully.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When they only saw Uncle Akbu and his men nearby, they became more courageous. Cabin doors opened one after another. The ones in the navy army uniforms carried the dead bodies out from inside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">We walked out of the spacecraft and watched them from afar, to give them quietness and space.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their metahumans began to perform their superpowers. Soil flew up and pits formed in the ground one after another.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They gently moved the dead bodies and put clothes on them. They found the dismembered heads and tried to make the bodies complete. Then, they wrapped the bodies with clean curtains before they placed them into the pits.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the other side lay many chunks of human body parts. It was hard to tell whose body parts they belonged to.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Someone seemed to recognize some of them and he wailed in tears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the quiet darkness, all that could be heard was their devastated crying.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Ghost Eclipsers deserve to die!” Sis Ceci gritted through her teeth. She glanced at Gehenna and his men by the side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Uncle Mason immediately took a step back to block Sis Ceci’s angry glare.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gru and Lucifer stood next to them too. Gru lowered his face, both sad and angry at once. “They aren’t humans!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even we flying corpses don’t eat live humans!” Lucifer shook his head. “Sometimes, we do eat dead bodies. But my tribe already doesn’t eat them. We know that we were once humans.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Angelina and her friends lowered their heads in silence as they looked afar sadly. Most likely they empathized with the young men’s plight. The people who’d served Margaery and they who had lived in humiliation among the Ghost Eclipsers had both been trapped in similar situations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even I think the Ghost Eclipsers deserve to die!” Earl muttered softly next to me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Phew…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” Nino let out a puff of smoke and remained silent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Boss, I look down on you!” Vanish glared in disdain. “You said that you want to attack the other Ghost Kings. How many years have you been saying that?! But today, Luo Bing did it! Look how decisive Luo Bing is!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Alright. With Boss’ capability, it’s already great that he could keep our livable zone.” Old Iron spoke up for Gehenna.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s a coward!” Vanish said directly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Boss, I can’t speak for you this time.” Nathan pouted. “It has been many years since you said that you want to kill the Ghost Eclipsers who eat humans but you are only plundering women all over the place.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Sigh…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;As of now, he can only save however many he can.” Blue Feather shook his head helplessly. “Although Boss didn’t honor his pledge, at least he saved quite a number of people.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gehenna became quiet as they spoke. Suddenly, he waved and shouted, “D*mn it! Let’s do it!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone gaped at him in shock. “You’re really going to do it?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Everyone stared at Gehenna, including Gehenna’s men.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">What is Gehenna trying to do?</span></p>
