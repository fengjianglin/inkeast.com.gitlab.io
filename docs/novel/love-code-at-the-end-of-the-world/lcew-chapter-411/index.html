 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Look!” Raffles pointed excitedly at the displayed conclusion. “The conclusion is out. There is no strengthened superpower. This embryo has been determined to be an ordinary human. Both parents’ superpower genes have not been passed down, nor does it have any new superpowers. It is only an ordinary human.” Raffles studied the conclusion, his eyes shimmering. “So, this combination has failed and needs to be destroyed.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Destroyed?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles turned back to the glass container as he spoke. With one touch of a button, the cell in the holographic image that had already turned into an embryo immediately shattered into pieces in an explosion!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The holographic image had no sound, but there was an ear-deafening explosion in my head.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">*Bang!*</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My head went blank and there was nothing but floating debris before me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My heart instantly quivered at the sight before me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">What is Raffles doing?!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">What is he doing with Cang Yu?!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There will only be one to two strengthened embryos in a hundred experiments…” Raffles explained to me excitedly. “Metahumans’ genes are categorized as dominant or recessive genes. Two powerful metahumans might not necessarily create a more powerful metahuman. On the contrary, it might possibly create an ordinary person. We call this reversion…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you doing?!” Unable to hold myself back, I roared at Raffles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Stunned, he blinked. “I’m creating metahumans. Lil Bing, come here and take a look!” Smiling excitedly, he pulled me to another end and pressed on a button by the side. A wall slid aside, and a spacious white warehouse appeared before me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is the gene bank in Silver Moon City,” Raffles introduced to me excitedly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The platform under our feet rose to hover in the air and stopped before a tall frozen warehouse. Raffles touched the board on the warehouse, which then turned transparent. Behind it, I saw rows of embryos with visible limbs and brains lined up neatly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“These are all strengthened embryos,” Raffles said excitedly. “Once the number of population in Silver Moon City drops due to war, we can withdraw a bunch of them and put them into genetic liquid. In just one month!” he continued with great excitement, “In just one month, an embryo can grow into a mature adult . A metahuman will give him memories, so that he would think that he grew up in Silver Moon City since young.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I stared at Raffles in shock.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">&nbsp;How can he be so excited!?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Does he know how merciless and cruel what he just said sounded?!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">What have humans become?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Have humans become toys on a production line?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Or poultry in a farm?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Does he know what he is doing?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">He is conducting experiments on human beings!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">The embryos are already put through survival of the fittest in his hands!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">How can he be so cruel?!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">I simply can’t believe that the Raffles I like, who was innocent and kind, has become a butcher!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">He even found it right and proper!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">These people will wake up thinking that they’ve grown up in Silver Moon City?! They won’t even know that they were produced in the cultivation cabin!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">The people that I see in Silver Moon City, those who joked with me, ate with me, attended classes with me, trained with me, and the young men who are fighting in the war, how many of them have been produced like that?!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">They are sacrificing for Silver Moon City, yet their genes are constantly used for experiments. Their children have become experiments!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">I can’t accept that. I can’t accept a reality like that! I can’t accept such cruel experiments.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At once I turned to leave.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">I can’t accept a Raffles who does such things!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lil Bing! What’s wrong?” Raffles was confused.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I hopped back down to the lab and shook off his arm. I glanced at him in disappointment and sorrow.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He became anxious. “Lil Bing, what’s wrong? Why are you suddenly angry?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I pointed at the cultivation box and roared, “Think about it! If they are our children, how would you feel?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was stunned. He looked at the cultivation box, dumbfounded. His gaze became complicated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I turned and left.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I knew that it was the end of the world and I knew that there was a lack of resources.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Maybe turning someone from an embryo into an adult was considered to be conserving resources. Maybe selecting embryos with better genes was considered to be conserving resources.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the world I’d come from had told me that this was inhuman. It was a gap that was hard to cross.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This gap wasn’t due to a difference in year or time, but a difference in space or even the universe!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If Raffles had failed in the fertilization stage, or if the embryo had failed to survive after fertilization, or if he’d gotten the consent of the biological parents, I would have felt better.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But what I had seen was him blowing up the embryo as though he was casually throwing out rubbish. His merciless and cruel &nbsp;scientific perspective gave me the chills.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wasn’t the Raffles I knew.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">No… Raffles didn’t change. It is me who can’t accept it…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he’d first laid eyes on Second Sis, his first response had been to use Second Sis for experiments…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He’d injected the strengthener for human genes into Second Sis for experimental purposes as well…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The environment provided in Silver Moon City had magnified his cruelty. The abundant gene bank had allowed him to freely conduct experiments as he wished...</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I continued to walk forward while he followed behind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although I ignored him, he followed behind me hastily without uttering a word.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I returned to my room. My training room had been converted into a painting room. I turned to close the door behind me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles quickly stopped the door from closing. “Lil Bing, I can stop if you don’t like me doing this. From a scientific viewpoint, they are only cells and are yet to be a living thing. Plus, at the end of the world, ordinary people would only suffer if they are born.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know!” I had never thought that there would be a day when I roared at Raffles. My temples clenched and throbbed in pain. Holding my head, I said, “Let me sort this out in my head. I don’t want to see you for the next two days…” I closed the door, shutting Raffles’ sad and disappointed face out of my sight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">I know. I know it all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I knew the cruelty of the end of the world. I knew that in the world I had come from, the embryo could be aborted if it was disabled in any way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Was it better to give birth to a child with Down’s Syndrome, or was it better to remove the child before it was formed? That dilemma already existed in the world I’d come from.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The doctor definitely had to get the parents’ feedback on that. The parents would experience great difficulty when making the decision as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I knew that everything was due to the special circumstances at the end of the world. However, I felt that the act of producing human lives on a production line like a factory made the existence of humans lose its meaning. Like mere tables and chairs, humans would be manufactured, selected, and destroyed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hence, in the world I had come from, parents carried feelings towards their unborn children. They would feel guilty and sad. They would cry for that lump of cells that had yet to be born.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>That was what being human truly meant. We humans had feelings.</span></p>
