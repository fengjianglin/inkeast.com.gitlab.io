 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Exactly! It turns out that you are making us deserters from an army!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In the end, you didn’t teach us anything, but you seized the chance to torture us and make fun of us!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan suddenly took a step forward and stood next to me. He roared at the guys, “Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All the guys went silent in an instant, and they looked at Xing Chuan in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Listen up. As Luo Bing is our coach, we have to obey her! Put your doubts and denial aside!” The guys took very long to come back to reality after hearing Xing Chuan’s words. They found it difficult to believe that Xing Chuan, who had been tortured the most, spoke for me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Ya looked at Xing Chuan in excitement and nudged Elena in secret. She said softly, “Brother has become manlier.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Elena blushed faintly. There seemed to be enthusiasm in her gaze as she looked at Xing Chuan. Her relationship with Xing Chuan seemed more like a sibling’s. But there was also the admiration of a lover in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guys took time to return to reality because they were shocked by Xing Chuan’s firm words. They were still quiet because they had yet to come back to reality.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I saw that everyone was quiet, and I continued, “As ordinary people, you can’t match against metahumans. Hence, you have to first stay alive to fight against the strong. It brings us to the next training subject, marksmanship!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When the guys heard that we were going to train shooting skills, they were excited again. No guy disliked guns.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Remember, no matter how amazing a metahuman is, he is a human!” I stared at the arrogant guys in front of me, “So, as long as you have great marksmanship, you can defeat them. Now, to the training ground!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When they heard ‘training ground,’ the guys were suddenly energetic again, even the ones who had been unhappy about running five laps. They were excited to practice shooting skills. Guns were charming to them, after all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was more than one training ground on Hagrid Island. There was a bigger one that was almost the size of a football stadium that could fit tens of thousands of people. We could have a gun battle, or we could simulate any sort of battle there.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The training ground had two rows of white racks elevated from the ground. There were a variety of guns and weapon, which looked magnificent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone picked up a training gun, and the target figurines popped up in front of them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I stood by the side and looked at them, “Begin shooting!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is too simple,” everyone lifted their guns with ease. They began to shoot and it looked like they were playing a game.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When the shooting ended, the robotic female voice resounded in the training ground, “The enemy is completely wiped out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guys looked at me with pride.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan looked proud too. “Today’s test is too simple. It’s easy to hit the enemy when they are not moving. You can change it to mock battle mode.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I smiled but kept quiet. I began to move the target near and lined them next to one another. There were over thirty of them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I walked past them one by one and stood before the first one. I gestured that the enemy was hit in the heart, and it was a crack shot, “Who did this?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A man stood up with pride, “I did!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I smirked coldly at him, “You’re dead.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guy was stunned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I pointed at the shot, “This is the spot to hit if you are shooting at an ordinary person. However, you are fighting against metahuman. Hitting here, I’m sorry, he might not die. On the contrary, it will expose your position, and he will kill you without hesitation!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guys immediately looked shocked and tensed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I walked past one figurine after another. I looked at the guys, “You’re dead. You’re dead. You’re dead too. You are completely dead! You too!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After one whole round, only five to six of them had hit the target’s head. One of them was Xing Chuan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I stood in front of them and Xing Chuan looked at me solemnly. “Please introduce metahumans to us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I nodded. Then, the guys finally became serious and I said, “There are many types of metahumans out there. Some can control the power of nature. For instance, they can stir tornado, snowstorm, and so on."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow!” The guys exclaimed in surprise. Who didn’t want to have a superpower? It did sound cool. However, they wouldn’t be so cool when they become your enemies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Some could control the power of elements, such as fire, water. There are also healers, who can heal. There are some self-healing metahumans too. There are also speed metahumans and space metahumans. When you come across them, remember that you don’t have to see their faces and superpowers. You only have to give them…” I pointed at my head, “a headshot.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guys, Xing Ya and Elena were stunned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I put my hand down. “Because regardless of the type of metahumans, they could require at least a second to three seconds to activate their superpowers. That’s the golden period to kill them. Once they activate their superpower, you might not have the power to counterattack.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Have you done it successfully, Luo Bing?” The guys looked at me in a taunting behavior.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you haven’t done it successfully yourself, how could you prove that it is the correct way?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan’s face suddenly grew glum. He turned and swept his glance at everyone. The guys immediately shut their mouths and stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Xing Chuan had gained prestige in their hearts.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">That’s great. I have achieved my goal. I won’t stay on Hagrid Island more than needed. Hence, I can’t become their spiritual leader. Otherwise, they will be disappointed when I leave.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow. Brother is becoming awesome!” Xing Ya looked at Xing Chuan like a fangirl. She whispered into Elena’s ear, “How does my brother look now? Isn’t he manly?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Elena blushed again. She turned to look elsewhere.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan, who was looking mature, let out an irresistible charm. In Silver Moon City, I had experienced it enough. All girls liked and were crazy over that Xing Chuan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was really like the poison that could charm people and make them addicted to it. Xing Chuan was poisonous after all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan looked to me solemnly. “Please continue.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I glanced at him and looked at the guys again, “At the beginning, I didn’t know that I have this superpower. So, you’re right. Before that, I used to fight with that method. Do you want me to count how many metahumans I have killed using that method?” I looked at them coldly, and I let out a murderous vibe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was no longer the sixteen years old girl from the past. There was countless Ghost Eclipsers’ blood on my hands. I had even shattered their souls completely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I carried the power of Death!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guys’ expression became tensed under my gloomy, murderous vibe. They slowly held their breaths, and the atmosphere became depressing and tense. There was even fear across their eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The entire training ground was in silence for a long time. Then, I spoke again, “From tomorrow onwards, run five laps in the morning and practice marksmanship in the afternoon. You can’t even do a headshot at a still target, let alone the moving ones.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They hung their heads in shame.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Dismiss!” I said as I ended the training that day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Before I got onto the island, they were curious about me, and they were heavily guarded against me. However, they had begun to let loose, after realizing that I meant no harm. In fact, they had started fining me harmless to the point that they thought I wasn’t as amazing and dangerous as they had imagined.</span></p>
