 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gehenna looked at Vanish and the others, his face suddenly growing solemn. “When we return, settle the women and the children. Then, let’s fight with all we have!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Alright!” Nathan and the others cheered with enthusiasm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vanish smiled faintly. “Finally, we’re going to do it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s more like it.” Earl pushed up his glasses with his middle finger. “That’s more like our Boss."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right!” Blue Feather spread his wings excitedly. They hugged one other’s shoulders and smiled under the blue sky. Their foul Ghost Eclipsers smell seemed to disperse in the breeze, magically vanishing under the clear sky.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sky seemed to be bluer than the year before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now you can take over Mary.” I glanced at Raffles and he nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Robots began to leave Ice Dragon to head over to Mary.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles got on the flying vehicle and Xiao Ying immediately followed behind. “I want to go too.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone else returned to the control room under the lead of Gehenna and He Lei. I looked at Uncle Mason. “Tell Uncle Akbu to get on Hurricane. Do you need to put on a disguise?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Uncle Mason and Sis Ceci exchanged a glance, their expression growing complicated. Finally, he shook his head and they smiled at each other and held hands. Uncle Mason said, “Let’s go. Let’s bring them home.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sis Ceci nodded with a smile. Then, she went to activate Hurricane along with Uncle Mason.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles and I headed over to Mary with Xiao Ying and the robots. We were prepared to take over Mary.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once they spotted us, the young men who were burying dead bodies immediately became nervous. They gathered and stood behind Moto.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soil dropped from the air. They looked terrified and anxious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">We landed the flying vehicle in front of them, while the robots stopped behind me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When I got off the flying vehicle, everyone began to move backwards. Some even panicked and fell into the pit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Ah</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!” He screamed, making the others even more nervous.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He, he is the person who killed the old lady,” Eletta told everyone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s him?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He, he, he, he, he…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Will he kill us?!” They hugged together fearfully.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t be scared. We would have been dead long ago if he wanted to kill us,” Moto shouted and turned to look at me calmly. The wound on his face had yet to heal. “How would you like to settle us?” He seemed to be resigned to his fate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles and Xiao Ying stood by my side but didn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xiao Ying measured the beautiful young men smilingly. “Why are there so many beautiful men in the Ghost Eclipsers? Where do you come from?” Xiao Ying asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone looked at Moto and Moto faced us calmly. “We came from different villages of the Ghost Eclipsers… We were chosen by the Bloody Queen. She will replenish her supply from various villages every month…” His voice sounded depressed and he glanced at the dead bodies in the pits. “We are merely her food…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Bloody Queen visited each village to select beautiful young men every month, but her action was referred to as replenishing the supply.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I swept my eyes over the troop of over fifty people and mentally added those in the pits. Mary should have had over eighty beautiful young men. Deducting those who had been eaten and used during her journey, there were not many left. The young men had been living every day in fear of being the next who would be sucked dry and eaten.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Among them, there were young men around the age of thirteen or fourteen. Margaery had mentioned that the inner thigh meat of a thirteen or fourteen-year-old young man was the most tender and the most delicious. They must have been her food during her journey.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t be nervous or afraid. We don’t eat humans,” I said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But you are the Ghost Eclipsers!” Moto roared at me. His voice was shaking and he lowered his head, resigned to his fate. “Our fate is in your hands."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Hehe</span><span>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” Xiao Ying suddenly grinned. “Then, your fate shall change from this very moment.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They gave us a confused look.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at them. “I know that you hate Mary but Mary is a spacecraft. So, I’m sorry that I can’t let you continue to vandalize it…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Humph…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;You’re the same after all…” Moto chuckled bitterly, “As long as you don’t eat humans, we are already lucky enough…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am not done yet,” I said after I’d waited patiently for him to finish what he’d wanted to say. They hung their heads low expressionlessly, as though they were puppets waiting to accept their fate. “You can remove all the furniture and burn them! Smash them into pieces! Do as you wish!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were stunned. I knitted my eyebrows. “Remember, smash that bathing pool. It disgusts me!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The young men were astounded. I gestured, “Hurry!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alarmed, they immediately ran into Mary as though they didn’t dare to delay further because they were used to being ordered around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moto, Eletta and another young man stumbled from being pushed by the young men behind them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at Moto, Eletta and the young man who had witnessed me killing Margaery. They were actually around my age. That was probably why Margaery had been interested in me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s your name?” I asked the third young man. He blinked and lowered his face. “Ghost King, I am Juye.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Ghost Eclipsers’ law was that whoever had killed a Ghost King would be the new Ghost King. It was simple and brutal. Hence, they now treated me like a Ghost King.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I nodded. “The three of you, go and treat your wounds.” I gestured at their faces. They were stunned. I pointed at Gehenna’s spacecraft. “You know that spacecraft, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We, we do!” They got anxious. Eletta said in a shivery voice, “That, that, that is Mister Gehenna’s Striking King.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Striking King… Which meaning of striking?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They pointed at their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Oh, so it’s the handsome kind of striking. It sure lived up to Gehenna’s shameless character. He’d even named his spacecraft so shamelessly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t be afraid. My people are inside there. They will heal you. I will take over Mary and your fate is not in my hand. If you are willing to trust me, you can follow me. If you don’t want to return to the Ghost Eclipsers, you can stay here. Koont Village is a nice place to live too."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Juye and Elette stared at me in surprise. They looked to Moto simultaneously. Moto seemed to have followed Mary for very long.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moto stared at me in disbelief. “You, you are willing to set us free.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I nodded. “The people who used to stay in Koont Village are going to leave. They grow crops here. There is a pond for rearing fish on the mountain peak too. The facilities here are complete. You can easily self-sustain…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They glanced around in surprise, looking at the field of corn swaying along in the breeze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“You look like the leader of these people. So, you are in charge of telling the others. Tonight, we will be resting here for a night. You can slowly think about it.” Then, as they stood dumbfounded, I entered Mary that was filled with bloodiness along with Raffles, Xiao Ying and the robots.</span></p>
