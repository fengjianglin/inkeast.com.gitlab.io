 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was a loud bang.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone was shocked, staring at Ghostie.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Team Leader! Why did you catch a water ghost? He is so scary.” Xiao Ying rested a flustered hand on her stacked chest. “But... You can be considered one of the better looking water ghosts.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I went forward and looked at Ghostie who was squinting, seemingly distressed. I introduced him to everyone, “This is Ghostie. He is my partner.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you serious!?” Sis Cannon exclaimed in surprise.They stared at me with their eyes wide open.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I explained, “Ghostie is an evolved water ghost. He is also a human. He is my friend and also my comrade. Ghostie, say hi to everyone!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They watched him curiously with the same gaze they would use to watch a water ghost, like they were zoo visitors watching a gorilla in a cage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie narrowed his eyes unhappily, and raised his middle finger at them!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone instantly froze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I couldn’t help but laugh, leaning against the cabin door in front of Ghostie. I said, “Ghostie is my friend and also my comrade. He is good at water battles. I have been with him for the past one year. We will be together in the future too.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Together… Forever...” Sis Cannon repeated awkwardly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, right! There’s Lucifer too.” I introduced him to everyone happily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lucifer?!” Sis Cannon chuckled again. “Sounds just like a pretty boy.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Right! Right! Team Leader! Quickly show us!” Xiao Ying clasped her hands together in excitement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Suddenly, a huge shadow flew past before our spaceship.</span><span>&nbsp;*Bang!*</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Lucifer landed on the windscreen, waving at us. Everyone was shocked as they cried, “Flying corpse!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lucifer.” I gave everyone a meaningful look. Everyone’s expressions started to twitch as they pointed at the flying corpse awkwardly in question, and I nodded, laughing. “Yes. That is Lucifer. Isn’t he handsome?” I winked at everyone playfully. I finally started getting back the old feeling of how I had felt when I had used to be with them. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They gawked for very long, as though their jaws had dislocated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lucifer hopped off the windscreen and vanished before us.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lil Bing.” Sis Cannon was about to speak but she paused before she continued, “I know that… you are going through a lot of pain from losing Harry. But... you can’t give up on yourself and refuse to choose humankind anymore...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>*</span><span>Bang!*</span><span style="font-style: italic">&nbsp;</span><span>Ghostie</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;hit the glass again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bro Bing. We agree with what Sis Cannon said.” The boys looked upset, gazing at me with heartache. “Harry would want you to be happy. How are you going to be happy… with a water ghost and a flying corpse?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You guys are perverts. Don’t go overboard on your jokes…” Xiao Ying crossed her arms angrily. Joey immediately hugged her shoulders, explaining, “We aren’t joking.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s enough, you guys! Do not involve Harry in your jokes!” Ming You was really agitated. “Harry is dead already!” Ming You couldn’t continue. She lowered her face and took a deep breath, before stomping to a corner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone became quiet because we knew that Ming You had loved Harry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My heart was aching too. I glanced at Ghostie. He lowered his face quietly; he was being exceptionally quiet in the water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>*</span><span>Bang!*&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Khai punched Ghostie’s water cabin in frustration. “It’d be so great if Harry’s death was a mistake as well. Then, all of us can reunite.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone was quiet. Sadness suffused throughout the spaceship.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Harry is not dead,” I muttered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Team Leader...” Sis Cannon placed her hand on my shoulder as she looked at me helplessly, at loss for words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you done looking!?” Bill suddenly shouted, catching everyone’s attention. He had also broken the silence between us. Only now did everyone else realize that Pelos and Xue Gie were still looking at each other.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bill was staring at Pelos glumly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone became improper again once they saw this scene.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bill, you’re jealous!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bill, you monopolized Xue Gie for about two years now! She already gave birth to your child too. You are still not letting her have another husband?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t be so petty. Xue Gie is very lonely at home when you’re out for missions.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh yeah. Mosie belongs to Arsenal now.” Joey wore a wide smile as he told me, “He is officially Princess Arsenal’s second husband now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I glanced at the bashful Mosie in surprise. “Really!? Congratulations!” Mosie had always wanted to be Arsenal’s man but Arsenal had chosen Bro Qian Li when I’d left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ming You calmed herself down and came back to us, joining in the conversation, “Luo Bing, a lot has changed while you were away.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah!” Xiao Ying jumped next to Ming You, chirping, “Sis Ming You has a husband now too!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Really!?” I looked at Ming You happily. She blushed and looked away with a smile, overflowing with happiness. I glanced at Ghostie in the water cabin. He was smiling happily too, popping his head out to look at all of us.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So, Bill, don’t be jealous. Sis Cannon has three husbands, Princess Arsenal has two, and Sis Ming You is going to choose her second husband. Xiao Ying will be married to us soon too. It is too little that Xue Gie only has you.” Everyone started jeering.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All of you, stop it! I don’t agree!” Bill was staring at everyone glumly, his possessiveness and dominance over Xue Gie flaring up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pelos looked down embarrassedly. He blushed. “I’m sorry. I just thought that this sister looks a lot like my mother.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bill was stunned. He asked, “Your mother!?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Boy, this is a shitty excuse.” Everyone made fun of Pelos.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I walked up next to Pelos and faced everyone seriously. I said, “Pelos is not joking. Xue Gie does look a lot like his mother. Wait until Uncle Mason brings Pelos’ family over. The truth will be revealed then.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone was surprised, looking puzzled and curious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>*</span><span>Swoosh.*</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;The door opened and Lucifer came walking in, gnawing his bread. “Sis Luo Bing, I am back.” His face was puffed up with bread, looking like a chewing hamster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He caught everyone’s attention again. Sis Cannon, Xiao Ying and Xue Gie’s eyes were glistening. Even Sis Ming You who was always serious looked surprised too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s so cute!” Sis Cannon ran over and hugged Lucifer. Sis Cannon was taller than me and Lucifer was only at the height of her chest. Now, Lucifer’s face was buried in between her huge boobs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xue Gie slowly reached out and patted Lucifer’s head. Her eyes were filled with love, just like she was stroking her own child.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Such a cute little brother.” Xiao Ying pounced over too, wanting to touch Lucifer’s head as well. Lucifer was in a daze as he had no idea what was happening.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re hiding such a cute boy!?” Ming You who rarely joked made fun of me too. “Who is this child?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lucifer.” All were surprised when I repeated the name.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?! He is Lucifer!?” Everyone exclaimed in unison, scaring Lucifer. He immediately pushed Sis Cannon away and ran to me with his bread in his mouth. Hugging my waist, his eyes flickered between them in a panic as he said, “Sis Luo Bing, I am scared.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">How can a flying corpse be afraid of humans?!&nbsp;</span></p>
