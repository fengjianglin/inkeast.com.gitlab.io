 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He gazed at me with pain and deep affection. "I'm sorry that I didn't look after Harry. I never expected you to be a..." He fixed his eyes on my face and seemed to daze off like me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I didn't know how long we stared at each other before he came back to reality. "Captain Chaksu and I are going down to build the base camp. I heard you want to participate in the war. I understand you want to take revenge for Harry but Harry definitely wouldn’t want you to be in danger nor would he want you to continue to kill more people. Plus, if you continue like this, you will lose your mind like Xing Chuan..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Xing Chuan... lost his mind?" I looked at He Lei suspiciously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He Lei furrowed his eyebrows solemnly. "Yes but it is understandable. We fought in the war for so long yet we didn't win. There were so many deaths and injuries everyday. Xing Chuan was under a lot of pressure. In the end, he panicked too. Since he had been on a winning streak... He became grumpy and lost his mind. I remembered that he frequently fought with Harry and Harry seemed to oppose his plan..." He Lei's eyebrows were tightly knitted. He lowered his head gloomily. "Losing Harry is equal to losing a hundred metahumans. Harry was really strong. It's a pity that I wasn't there. If I was there! I-!” He Lei clenched his fists remorsefully. "It was a mess that day! There were too many people that we needed to save. I was only thinking about saving Captain Chaksu but I didn't know that Harry..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tears flowed out from his eyes. He took a deep breath and wiped his tears. "Harry and I have been great comrades and great friends. Now that I’ve lost Harry, I don't know who to fight alongside with. I trusted Silver Moon City mainly because I trusted Harry. During the days in Silver Moon City, he was the one who reorganized the Aurora Legion for me so they can be what they are today..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He took another deep breath and became quiet for very long.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">More people appeared in the surroundings. They were surprised to see me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Look. It's the North Star!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"North Star is a girl..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I’ve never noticed even after we’ve lived together for so long..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Someone walked towards me. He Lei turned to stand next to me, as though he was protecting me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"North Star, our condolences about Harry. We are sad to lose him too." Everyone stood around me and gazed at me with sorrow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Harry always took care of us... We're sorry..." Many of them wanted to say something but in the end remained quiet. They seemed not to know what to say to me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"North Star... Feel better soon... You... Rest well..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let’s not disturb the North Star..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone began to disperse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't disturb the North Star, everyone!" Sophia pushed them away. "Go back! Go back!" She chased everyone away and stood before me. Her expression became complicated and awkward. She lowered her face. "Luo Bing... Please feel better... His Highness Xing Chuan... didn't want it to happen too..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked away in pain. I didn't want to hear Xing Chuan's name again. Although I knew that Harry's death had nothing to do with him... But!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Luo Bing..." He Lei found it difficult to organize his sentences too. "I know that you blame Xing Chuan for Harry's death but this is war. Xing Chuan didn't wish for Harry's death either. So..." He Lei stopped, unsure how to continue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My heart felt weighed down with pain, and my head was throbbing too. "I know but just like when he threw me off the spaceship back then, I can understand it but I cannot forgive him for throwing me off. I know that Harry's..." Choking with sobs, I fought back my tears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm sorry!" He Lei hugged me and let me lean on his shoulder. "I'm sorry... You don't have to forgive Xing Chuan..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's right!" Sophia said hastily. "Continue to be mad at His Highness Xing Chuan. Let him stay in the prison and think about what he has done!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Harry's death has nothing to do with His Highness!" Moon Dream suddenly roared. Sophia looked to the side. "Moon Dream!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone who was originally leaving stopped in their tracks, their attention on Moon Dream.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He Lei let go of me and glared at Moon Dream angrily. "Moon Dream, His Highness Cang Yu already commanded for everyone to not disturb the North Star."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>",</span><span style="font-style: italic">Humph</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">" Moon Dream chuckled lightly in disdain. "Do you have to spoil her like that?! This is war!" Moon Dream bellowed furiously and looked around her. "Since this war began, there's been someone sacrificing their lives every day! How many girls in Silver Moon City have lost their loved ones! I don't see them wailing in tears and becoming spiritless like you!" Moon Dream pointed at me in disdain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I clenched my fists and held back my tears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Didn’t you tell everyone to be strong? Did you do it yourself?" Moon Dream shook her head and chuckled. "I finally understood why I found you sissy back then, seducing all those men. It turns out that you are a woman!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Moon Dream!" Sophia yelled at her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Moon Dream!" Sharjah and Gale ran over in a hurry too. Gale had swiftly brought Sharjah over and Sharjah held Moon Dream back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't pull me!" Moon Dream shook off Sharjah. "Did I say anything wrong?! This is war! Harry's death is not something His Highness wanted too! It has nothing to do with His Highness!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Does he really have nothing to do with it?!" He Lei walked before me angrily. "We all knew that Harry opposed Xing Chuan's plan! Xing Chuan had been upset about him all this while!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That is because Harry was interrupting His Highness' plan!" Moon Dream fought back, "His Highness is the general. We have to listen to him! This is war! That's not negotiable. Harry is violating military discipline!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You tell us what happened that day then?!" He Lei questioned her in return!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moon Dream looked stunned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He Lei took another step closer to her. "From what I heard, you were there too! With Harry's superpower, how could he die so easily?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moon Dream took a step back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yama rushed over. "Stop fighting. His Highness Cang Yu has sent people here. If His Highness Cang Yu was to see this, you know what will happen!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moon Dream panicked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Pfft</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Don't be guilty after you’ve said it out loud." Matsuno came too and rolled his eyes at Moon Dream.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In an instant, the North Star knight group had gathered there.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Moon Dream, what happened that day?!" I pushed He Lei away and stalked towards her. She began to step back. "Don't come near me! You monster!" She suddenly roared at me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I stopped.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone stared at Moon Dream in shock.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Moon Dream, what are you talking about?! You better be straight with me!" Sophia was immediately furious. "Who are you calling a monster?! What monster?! If it wasn't for Luo Bing, we might not have conquered Steel Ghost City now! You might also be dead by now!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Aren't there a lot of people scared of her now?" Moon Dream pointed at me and chuckled lightly. "His Highness Cang Yu ordered everyone to not disturb her probably because he is worried that she’ll lose control and destroy the entire Silver Moon City!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My head buzzed. I stumbled backward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His Highness Cang Yu told everyone not to disturb me because he was worried that I’d lose control...</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">I’ve been determined to be a large scale destructive weapon...</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">I am a weapon...</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">I am highly destructive...</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I know what happened that day..." I suddenly heard Nora’s voice. "My superpower is to connect to you mentally so you can't differentiate illusion from reality. So, I can let you connect to Moon Dream directly and see what she saw..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Nora..." My surroundings turned quiet. Everyone had disappeared, leaving only a spacious field.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Do you trust me? If you do, don't resist me. I can show you Moon Dream's memory..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I glanced around me at once. "Show me! I trust you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Alright..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, Moon Dream appeared before me. She looked confused. Then, she suddenly seemed to understand and glanced around happily/ "Nora? You aren't dead?! That's great!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I want to show Luo Bing your memory..." Nora's face slowly appeared in mid-air. Moon Dream instantly became terrified. "No! Nora, you can't do that!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nora smiled. "Why not? We have a mutual enemy and that's Luo Bing. As soon as she sees it, she won't give His Highness Xing Chuan a chance..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moon Dream was stunned, then her eyes started shimmering with hope.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If she sees it, she will leave my Highness Cang Yu too..." Nora’s figure could be vaguely seen in the air. "My Highness Cang Yu only belongs to me..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I didn't care what their purpose was! I only wanted to see the truth! I wanted to see how Harry had died!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hurry up and show me!" I looked at Moon Dream with determination. "I want the truth! I don't want your men!" I roared at the two women!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moon Dream bit her lips and glanced at Nora who was vaguely visible. "Alright! But we definitely can't let His Highness find out!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Floating in mid-air, Nora smiled. "Don't worry. He won't know..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nora instantly flew in between me and Moon Dream. Suddenly, my surroundings changed again. I saw Captain Chaksu's battleship gradually falling from the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Your Highness! We did it!" I heard Moon Dream's voice. In front of me was Xing Chuan who stood by the cabin door. Moon Dream was standing next to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan lifted the corners of his lips and smirked coldly. "Prepare to attack Steel Ghost City!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Xing Chuan! How could you use the Aurora Legion as bait?!" I heard Harry's voice. Harry!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Harry instantly rushed into my sight. I understood then. I was watching from Moon Dream's viewpoint.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He grabbed Xing Chuan's collar angrily. "How could you send the entire Aurora Legion to their deaths?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Harry, let go!" Xing Chuan pulled Harry's arm coldly as he glared at Harry. "This is war! We are fighting a war! Put your love and care aside!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Harry stared at him angrily. "You used the Aurora Legion as bait! What's the difference between you and the Ghost Eclipsers who used human bombs?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan tidied his collar that had gotten messed up by Harry. "The only difference between me and the Ghost Eclipsers is merely victory and defeat! As long as we win, everyone in the Aurora Legion battleship will be heroes!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Harry spat on Xing Chuan and stalked to the cabin door. "I am going to save them. You go and attack Steel Ghost City on your own!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>*</span><span>Hong!*&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, the spaceship was hit and it shook vigorously. In an instant, Xing Chuan and Harry who had been standing at the cabin door fell off the spaceship!</span></p>
