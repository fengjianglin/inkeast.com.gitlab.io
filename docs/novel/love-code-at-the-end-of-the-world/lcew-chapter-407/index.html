 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see!” Raffles excitedly measured Xing Chuan up and down with his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan’s eyebrows knitted as Raffles scrutinized and examined him. Then, Raffles glanced at the hole behind Xing Chuan. “So changing your own shape is Your Highness’s initial superpower. Changing another object’s shape is Your Highness’s secondary superpower… No, that’s not right. Changing another object’s shape is Your Highness’s initial superpower, and changing the object’s form should be His Highness’s secondary superpower!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I noticed Xing Chuan’s expression tense up. He stared closely at Raffles and narrowed his eyes. Coldness flashed in his eyes!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Did Raffles get it right?!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles entered his double brain working mode, gesturing in the air as he spoke, “Hence, His Highness isn’t changing his shape but he has actually already entered tertiary evolution! He superpowerfied! His Highness completed tertiary evolution!” Raffles stared at Xing Chuan in surprise and in admiration.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan glared at Raffles coldly. “You are really smart indeed.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’ve really completed tertiary evolution!” I stared at Xing Chuan in disbelief. “So, you are superpowerfied! You can change your form as you wish?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.” Xing Chuan looked at me expressionlessly. I pointed at him at once. “You, lengthen yourself and show me again.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan’s face darkened at once. For the first time, he revealed an expression that said he didn’t want to talk to me anymore as he turned and left. Xing Chuan actually left!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wisely I stopped while the going was still good. However, Raffles obviously had no such scruples. He quickly stopped Xing Chuan. “Your Highness, can you let me do some experiments? I believe your data is definitely useful for a breakthrough in tertiary evolution.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you done!?” Xing Chuan roared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Whenever Raffles entered his research mode, he was fearless against all threats and he would stop at nothing. He continued to bother Xing Chuan as though he was a new fan of Xing Chuan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Highness Xing Chuan, this is very important! Lil Bing is already in secondary evolution. If I could glean some insights from you, I might be able to help her enter tertiary evolution!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Luo Bing is already in secondary evolution?” Xing Chuan stared at me in shock. His eyes dilated, and he seemed to be in deep thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles continued to look over Xing Chuan, experimentally pinching his arm. “Tertiary evolution would lead to changes in metahuman’s individual genes…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The robot in Kro that suddenly had electricity…” Xing Chuan instantly turned to me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I immediately looked away. Why did Raffles sell me out? The people in Silver Moon City only knew that I could enter the center of the radiation zone and cleanse radiation, but they didn’t know that I could release energy too.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You didn’t know?” Surprised, Raffles became nervous and backtracked. “No, no, no. Lil Bing has yet to go through secondary evolution. She can only enter the center of the radiation zone…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Raffles, stop pretending.” Xing Chuan suddenly gave Raffles a glum look.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles seemed confused. “Pretend what?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan looked at Raffles for a while before he finally flashed a gentle smile. “Did you see through my feelings for Luo Bing? You know that I wouldn’t hurt Luo Bing so you purposely told me that she has already achieved secondary evolution.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles blinked and his grayish-blue eyes twinkled. He smiled at Xing Chuan. “Are you willing to help Luo Bing reach tertiary evolution? Only if she becomes stronger, would other men not dare to approach her.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles turned back and smiled at me. I was dumbfounded. I’d never expected that Raffles’ slip of the tongue had carried such meaning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Raffles,” Xing Chuan said smilingly. In front of me, Xing Chuan moved a step closer to Raffles. He suddenly jerked Raffles by his arm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles had always been fragile. He knocked onto Xing Chuan's chest, yet he maintained a smile. His loosely tied hair scattered and fell down his shoulders because of Xing Chuan’s sudden jerk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan watched him, still smiling. There was coldness in his smile. “You’ve become devious.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles smiled at Xing Chuan too. “I am ashamed that I am not as capable as Harry in terms of superpower. I can’t protect Luo Bing, nor can I face off against someone as powerful as Your Highness. Hence, I can only work hard to make Lil Bing stronger. This way, there will be no one who can force Lil Bing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Had Raffles understood everything after he’d seen Xing Chuan lick me?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan narrowed his eyes, his smile cold as frost.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now that Your Highness is leaving Silver Moon City too, what should I do if a man stronger than Your Highness turns up?” Raffles continued to smile innocently at Xing Chuan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Stunned, Xing Chuan let go of Raffles. The coldness in his expression vanished and he smiled faintly. “I feel at ease seeing you becoming devious. What do you want me to do?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffle became excited. “Hold on, Your Highness. Let me go and get my equipment.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan’s face grew gloomy. He obviously hadn’t expected Raffles to come well prepared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles ran before me. “Lil Bing, I will help you to complete your tertiary evolution!” Raffles’ eyes were shimmering with excitement. He quickly ran back to the bedroom at once.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I watched his fast-moving figure. The Raffles I was familiar with had come back again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Raffles loves you a lot,” Xing Chuan said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I smiled. “Yes, Raffles loves me a lot.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It turns out that this can be a way of love too.” Xing Chuan became expressionless, sinking deep into his thoughts. “He knows that his superpower can’t protect you so he works hard for your disguise…” Xing Chuan’s gaze settled on my face, before sweeping down my body. “...for you to become stronger.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles was like the merchant in games. He constantly leveled up my equipment and my superpower. Raffles was safeguarding me and loving me in the way only he could.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Can you show me your secondary superpower?” Xing Chuan said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I smiled. “Tell your robot to come.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan raised his hand and snapped his fingers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The robot that had served me and Xing Chuan crossed over from Xing Chuan’s room to mine, coming to stand in between us. Xing Chuan then leaned down to press the robot’s head. He took out the battery from the robot’s circuit board.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then he straightened, waiting to see me perform.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I let out a long sigh. By now I was experienced in charging. Slowly I felt the energy in me churning, an indescribably magical feeling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My finger began to let out a blue glow before becoming translucent, just like when I was absorbing energy. Energy rushed into the robot, which suddenly woke up and looked at us. “I felt blue crystal energy! I am full of energy now! I want to do some cleaning! Snowball shat again!” The robot immediately scurried back to Xing Chuan’s room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I lifted my right hand and looked at Xing Chuan. “Raffles said that this is probably the secondary evolution of my superpower. It transforms from absorbing to releasing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan stared at me in surprise. “How much can you absorb? How much can you release?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ve never tried.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If my calculation is right, Lil Bing should be able to provide enough energy for a starship!” Raffles walked past me hastily with a piece of handmade equipment in his hand. He looked at Xing Chuan proudly. “Hence, Lil Bing is the most precious portable blue crystal energy in this world!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Xing Chuan was instantly stunned.</span></p>
