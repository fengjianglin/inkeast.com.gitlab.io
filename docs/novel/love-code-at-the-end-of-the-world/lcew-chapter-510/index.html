 <p style="text-align: left"><span>*</span><span>Clang, clang, clang.*</span><span style="font-style: italic">&nbsp;</span><span>Ghostie</span><span>&nbsp;was slamming the cabin door. I glanced at him and he nodded vigorously. Exhaling a warm breath against the cabin door, he wrote on the door anxiously: “</span><span style="font-style: italic">This is an important mission. We need an experienced veteran</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie was right. The mission to evacuate and relocate the people in Koont Village was really important. An experienced veteran was needed to escort them safely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I turned and looked at Uncle Mason. “Fine, but please stay calm. Don’t let them find out that it’s you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Uncle Mason was stunned, before he became happy, as happy as a kid. Suddenly, he was stunned again. He looked next to me and exclaimed, “You actually listened to a water ghost!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ghostie suggested for you to go,” I said expressionlessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Uncle Mason was perplexed and surprised. Taking a glance at the water ghost, he nodded his head gratefully.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie smiled widely and his huge fishy eyes became moist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Uncle Mason stared at Ghostie and somehow became absent-minded too.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Our opponent’s army will probably arrive at Koont Village anytime.” My voice caught Uncle Mason’s attention again. “So, bring Brother Qian Li with you. He can watch over the place at all times. If the enemy is spotted before you arrive at Koont Village, stay at where you are and wait for orders. If the rescue is already in process, evacuate a part of them first. Uncle Akbu will deal with it accordingly. Make sure you don’t act on impulse because there are many women and children in Koont Village and we aren’t sure if the enemy is a Ghost King.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Understood!” Uncle Mason saluted. Then, he looked at me gratefully. “Lil Bing, you have really grown up. You are no longer the crying little girl that I saved back then. If Harry was still alive…” He sobbed for a while then smiled when he said, “He would be very proud of you!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I said with a low voice, “He is still alive.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lil Bing, I understand how you feel. Ceci and I wish that Harry is still alive as well. But, we have to face the reality. Lil Bing, you have to look forward. As long as you’re happy, Harry will be…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“He is still alive!” *</span><span>Bang!*</span><span style="font-style: italic">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I punched Ghostie’s cabin door really hard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Uncle Mason was shocked. I couldn’t calm myself down. Glancing at him, I hung my face low. “Hurry up. You are in charge of evacuating the people in Koont Village. Keep in touch.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes,” Uncle Mason replied and our conversation ended.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I retracted the hand that I’d slammed on Ghostie’s cabin door. Then, I looked up and felt Pelos’ tense gaze upon me. I also saw Lucifer’s stunned expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at Ghostie in the cabin. He hung his head low and sat underwater. He was really quiet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Calming myself down, I turned to Pelos and Lucifer. “Prepare for war.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pelos immediately sat up, while Lucifer looked at me anxiously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I stroked his head. He was still a child. “I am sorry that I scared you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Hm</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.” He shook his head and smiled while he continued to eat his bun.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The scenery in front of us looked more and more familiar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ice Dragon appeared again. “The energy detector has detected a huge energy fluctuation ahead, inferring that a war is happening.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Land in place.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ice Dragon started to descend.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Send the scouting robots.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The scouting robots are out. Entering invisible mode. Beginning video transmission.” Ice Dragon lifted its right hand and video feeds appeared one after another.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pelos couldn’t help but get up from his seat. He stood under the video feeds and watched them in amazement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One of the video feeds was showing smoke all over Blue Shield City. A huge area of buildings and architectures had been destroyed. There was also a really horrifying giant head hovering in the sky of Blue Shield City. Huge as a mountain, it was staring down at Blue Shield City with its huge eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pelos exclaimed, “That’s the senior general of Gehenna, Nathan! He can monitor everyone’s actions, and is even more powerful than a surveillance robot. He can see you no matter where you’re hiding.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Another footage showed a group of traders resisting. Suddenly, a tiny needle appeared in the air and pierced through the neck of the opponent like a honeybee. The metahuman fell immediately. The people around him immediately raised their hands and surrendered once they saw that happen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then people started surrendering and kneeling on the ground where they stood.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, I saw Bill, Williams, Sia, Joey and Khai in a video feed!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were still battling, with wounds all over their bodies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">倏然，又是那神秘针管倏然出现，一下子出现了好几支，都准确定位在比尔他们颈后，他们根本没有察觉，那些针一下子扎入了他们的颈项！</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, another mysterious needle appeared again. A few needles split out of that one needle, and all of them were all targeting the necks of Bill and the rest. They didn’t feel anything. The needles pierced through their necks in an instant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What was that!?” I froze the screen and pointed at the needle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pelos was shocked as he looked closely. “He is probably another general of Gehenna’s. The Devil Doctor, Vanish. It is said that he can materialize any needles in the air and inject any substance into the body. It is most likely an ability inhibitor.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was surprised. Although I had battled against the Ghost Eclipsers quite a number of times before that and I had seen many magical abilities, the powers that I saw today were definitely way more powerful than the ones I had seen before. Their scope was way bigger and they were way more precise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bill and the rest collapsed onto the ground. They were swiftly taken under control by the attacking Ghost Eclipsers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In just a blink of an eye, the entire Blue Shield City was overrun with Ghost Eclipsers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The city gate opened and the Ghost Eclipsers flooded into the city. The last person to enter was Gehenna!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He opened his arms wide, raising his face to the sky as he laughed. His dark hair billowed in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A handsome man in a black robe stood next to him, his expression cold. Numerous needles and tubes surrounded him, all ready to be fired.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had to be the Devil Doctor, Vanish.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ice Dragon reported, “The ships of the enemy have been detected.” Video feeds from the scouting robots were sent back to us. Gehenna’s warship was stationed at an area further away from Blue Shield City. There were quite a number of guards watching and guarding the warship.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While the spaceships of the traders had all been destroyed. It was a huge mess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Other video feeds showed that Blue Shield City had already been captured. Metahumans were littered all over the floor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A troop of Ghost Eclipsers were herding the Honeycomb boys out of their building and towards the city gate. From the looks of it, they were getting ready to bring the boys back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">其余蚀鬼族也将倒落在地上的人拖起来，往外拖，他们还没死，只是被限制了能力。</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The remaining Ghost Eclipsers were dragging those fallen people out of the city. They weren’t dead yet, just that their abilities and powers had all been inhibited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pelos looked at me anxiously. “What should we do?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I lifted my hand, my eyes flicking between all the video feeds. “Don’t panic. We are at a disadvantage now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The screens started transmitting audio.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gehenna stood by the gate with the Ghost Eclipsers standing on both sides of him. The Ghost Eclipsers cheered when the Honeycomb boys were pushed out of the gate. They extended their dirty hands and touched those boys.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The boys were scared. They huddled close to each other and tried to protect each other. Some of the younger ones cried. They were as weak as girls.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A few Ghost Eclipser couldn’t wait anymore and suddenly waded into the group of boy. They pushed the boys towards a corner. A few of them surrounded the boys and started tearing their clothes off. The boys were scared and whimpered. “Please, please be gentle...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>*</span><span>Bang!*</span><span style="font-style: italic">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I couldn’t stand it anymore. I turned and walked away.&nbsp;</span></p>
