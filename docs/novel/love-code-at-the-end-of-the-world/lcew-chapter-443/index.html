 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Ya’s eyes opened wide. “Where does your confidence come from? How about this, I will call you my teacher if you win and I will learn from you in the future.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sure!” I patted her shoulders and accepted her as my disciple. “You will have an easier time staying alive if you learn from me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Xing Ya pursed her lips in doubt. Throwing me a glance, she lifted her chin with the pride of a princess. “</span><span style="font-style: italic">Humph</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. My brother is definitely going to win.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A huge spherical room opened up in front of us. Outside the glass wall by the side was the boundless ocean and blue sky. Of course, there was an invisible wall out there too. The invisible wall would automatically mimic the surrounding environment hence you couldn’t see it usually. If it wasn’t because of the opening, you wouldn’t even notice its existence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That wall was the only guard for Hagrid Island.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan entered the glass room. It seemed to be a training room, with many guys practicing with one another inside. By the side were white simulated weapons. I’d seen them in Noah City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Silver Moon City was more advanced. They used Nami weapons. Hence, those could turn into anything in your hand and were only used during training. In actual battle, the Nami robot and shape-changing weapon had little destructive power.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Highness!” The guys who were training quickly stood straight. They looked disciplined. The basis of a military force was strict discipline.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan nodded at them and waved for them to move to the side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They looked confused. They glanced at me and their expression grew tense. The guys’ psychological endurance was higher.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan took off his coat and passed it to Elena.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Be less forceful,” Elena exhorted again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan nodded and he looked serious. The Xing Chuan here maintained the elegance of a prince at all times. Sometimes, I would see Cang Yu’s shadow in him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was dressed in a casual outfit normally worn by the girls on the island. The top was a silver-grey shirt made of a comfortable and close-fitting material, with a V-shaped collar and gathered waist that covered past the butt. On the bottom I wore straight-cut pants that were similarly comfortable but with a wider fit for ease of movement. Although the pants were in the same silver-grey shade, when worn on a girl it made her look very spirited.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I tied my long hair up into a bun on the top of my head. Then, I went to the middle of the training room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pick a weapon,” Xing Chuan told me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at him calmly. “I don’t need a weapon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Luo Bing!” Xing Ya took out a white sword. “Take one.” She passed it to me but I pushed it away. The surrounding guys were shocked at the sight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are they doing?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Could it be that His Highness is fighting against Luo Bing?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Highness will be hurt! Luo Bing is a metahuman!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Luo Bing is not using her superpower,” Xing Ya explained.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?! Then, Luo Bing will be hurt! His Highness is the one with the best sword skills among us!” The guys began to look worried for me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Highness, you can’t bully girls!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan smiled faintly and he maintained his prince’s bearing. He lifted his hand and faced me with an elegant posture. “Since you are not using a sword, I will not too. Also, I will use only one hand.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing him holding his head high and throwing out his chest, I wanted to laugh. I felt like I was going to beat the Prince Charming in a fairy tale. I wondered why I felt secretly delighted. Was it a subconscious desire to destroy?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I took a deep breath and let it out. “Alright, alright.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was posing now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Can we begin?” I asked politely. If he was an enemy, I wouldn’t bother asking but instead just hit him directly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He nodded at me. “As long as you are ready.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Okay!” I charged forward and kicked!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>*</span><span>Bang!*</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;He was sent flying backward by my kick.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone was dumbfounded at the moment as though their chins had dislocated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan had been kicked clean off the ground. He landed and slid for a few meters. He only stopped when he hit the wall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Cough!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” He held the spot I’d kicked and went into a daze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone had yet to come back to reality.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Elena immediately ran to Xing Chuan and helped him up. “Are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“I...&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">poof</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!” He spit out a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Ah</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!” Elena and Xing Ya exclaimed in surprise and covered their mouths in unison.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Ya gawked at me in surprise while Elena wiped the blood at the corner of Xing Chuan’s lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I walked to the side and withdrew a sword. Xing Ya stared at me with her eyes wide open. “What happened?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I didn’t reply. I placed one hand behind my back and I threw a sword before Xing Chuan. “You weren’t prepared earlier. Let’s do it again!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A flame ignited in Xing Chuan’s eyes. He gently pushed Elena away and picked up the sword on the ground. He stood with his chest out again and maintained his elegance as a prince.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I didn’t take any weapon but returned to the middle of the room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He took a deep breath and readjusted himself, before he walked up to stand across from me. His pupils suddenly dilated in concentration and he raised his sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I didn’t take an offensive position. He suddenly stabbed at me. Turning in the inner side of his arm, I came up before his body. I locked his wrist with one hand and held his arm with the other. Then I twisted my waist with force and *</span><span>bang!*</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;He was thrown on the ground again. At once, I turned and sat on him. Just as he was trying to get up, I formed my fingers into a gun shape and poked in between his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He stared at me in shock while I glared at his face. The hatred in me began to eat at me again. His face overlapped with the b*stard’s face and I couldn’t differentiate them for a moment. I pressed his wrists firmly and poked in between his eyebrows heavily. His gaze became confused and solemn as he stared at my fierce expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We use guns outside! You are too slow, Your Highness Xing Chuan!” Using the fingers I’d seized his wrist with, I pressed on an acupuncture point on his wrist and the sword in his hand dropped. His face distorted in agony and he let out a gasp in pain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I removed myself from his body. At the very last moment, I finally suppressed the hatred in me and controlled my anger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once I cooled down, I glanced at Xing Ya. “Time for class.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Ya was shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your Highness.” Elena rushed over and helped Xing Chuan up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh my! Did Luo Bing defeat our Highness?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Luo Bing, how did you do that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you know how to use a gun? Can you show us? How’s your shooting skill?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guys suddenly became excited and surrounded me. Someone put a white gun in my hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I glanced at him and he looked at me excitedly. “Show us!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah, show us!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We don’t normally get to use a gun!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yeah. They wouldn’t need a gun here. Practicing here was like children practicing Taekwondo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at them for a while. “Alright!” I took the gun.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After I took the gun, the guys retreated to the side. The entire training room began to shake and buzz.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Ya ran to help Elena to support Xing Chuan who was staring at me the whole time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Darkness started to cover the spherical room’s glass wall. A spaceship flew past the sky above me. It was a holographic mock battle. Noah City and Silver Moon City had often used it for battle training.</span></p>
