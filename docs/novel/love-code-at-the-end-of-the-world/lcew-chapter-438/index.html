 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles mentioned that among the three mutated humans, Day Monsters and water ghosts were the ones with lower IQ. However, it didn’t mean that there wouldn’t be one or two who evolved to have human intelligence. Hence, we couldn’t exclude the possibility that there were some among the Day Monsters and water ghosts who had stronger human genetics.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I reckoned that Ghostie was one of the few among the hundreds of thousands of water ghosts who had evolved.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie could understand human language. He had his own thinking method and his own thoughts. Besides not having linguistic ability, he had his own emotions and he could express them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles would definitely want to meet Ghostie.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Oh yeah.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Raffles…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Raffles is definitely worried about me,” I told Ghostie. “It was really irresponsible for me to leave like that. Those two b*tches…” I supported myself with both of my hands behind my back. Looking up at the huge opening in the sky, I saw the brightest North Star.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A few months had passed. I’d finally calmed down. I felt the sorried towards Raffles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie remained quiet as he watched me. The moonlight shone on his green skin, reflecting a cold glint. He stood up and walked to the sea, leaving a row of his flipper footprints.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wore swimming trunks with women's boobs printed on them. The boobs twisted as he walked, making for a funny sight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He jumped into the ocean. Suddenly, two legs rose above the surface of the water and started flapping around under the moonlight. I chuckled. Ghostie would always make me laugh like this when I was upset.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie had become my companion here. Although Jun and Zong Ben were here with me too, they couldn’t be let out at all times because it would create radiation, and would also spend a lot of their blue crystal energy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With Ghostie, I no longer needed to catch my own seafood. I only needed to shout, “Ghostie!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, a bunch of seafood would be thrown on the shore.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that a water ghost?!” Xing Ya jumped next to me curiously. “Is it? Is it?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I picked up the seafood that Ghostie had tossed over and returned to the grill.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie didn’t appear normally. He’d only been discovered while he was hunting seafood for me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Grandma said that water ghosts are dangerous. Since you can control him, don’t let him go near Hagrid Island. Then, grandma will allow you to keep him.” Xing Ya’s robot bird hopped around me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I glanced at her. “Your grandma is right. Water ghosts are dangerous. It’s just that Ghostie developed human intelligence, so he wouldn’t hurt a human. And I don’t control him, he behaves that way because he knows that he is a human!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see. Can I see him?!” Xing Chuan jumped excitedly. “Can I? Can I?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ghostie doesn’t like to see others,” I replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Pfft</span><span>. Luo Bing, you are so petty.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Humph</span><span>.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;The robot bird turned away. “I’m the only one who’s been coming to talk to you the past few months.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you.” I put the grilled oyster into her food container and smiled at her. “Your grandma told you that water ghosts are very dangerous. I can’t just let him come out whenever. He is my only friend now. I can’t let your grandma chase him away.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Alright. I’ll go and convince grandma.” Xing Ya carried the food container and left.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were times when I would sit on the reef as I looked at Hagrid Island from afar. Ghostie would be playing with the little crabs that he’d caught from the sea by the side. It was a mysterious island that no one outside knew about. Just how advanced was their technology?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If they had been isolated from the outside world for sixty years, then there shouldn’t be any blue crystal energy on the island.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their food was abundant but they didn’t seem to have developed industrially because they couldn’t repair the opening that I had made. It meant that they had no materials with which to repair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The material of the dome was definitely special because it had kept Hagrid Island hidden for sixty years. It had escaped from the Ghost Eclipers as well as Silver Moon City.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, I’d broken it. Would it be discovered?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie dived into the water all of a sudden. It turned out that a robot bird had flown over.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The robot bird landed on the reef next to me and looked at me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You came from Silver Moon City, right?” It was the old voice, the old grandma. “The ejection capsule belonged to Silver Moon City.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I glanced at the robot bird. “Yes, I came from Silver Moon City but aren’t you worried that I am Silver Moon City’s enemy?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All sin started from Silver Moon City.” Suddenly, the old grandma said, “I believe in my judgment. You are a good kid.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was astonished.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The robot bird looked up and pointed at the sky. “Our dome broke because of you. If the people outside were to discover us, will you protect us?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will,” I replied without hesitation. “I will take responsibility for it to the very end.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The robot bird nodded. “Alright, I will allow you and Ghostie to live on the island with us. However, please do not look too surprised when you see Chuan because he doesn’t know of the existence of another Xing Chuan. No matter if that Xing Chuan is good or bad, don’t let Chuan find out about him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was even more surprised. It meant that the grandma knew the hidden truth, whatever it was!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You know the Xing Chuan on Silver Moon City? Who are you?” I stared at her in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The robot bird turned around. “This is not a question you should be asking. If you want to live on the island, don’t ask too many questions.” The old grandma had a queen’s bearing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I understand.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Waves lapped on the beach, soft as lovers’ mutterings in the surrounding silence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The children are curious about the outside world.” The old grandma gazed into the high sky and let out a heavy sigh. “I need you to dismiss their ideas about the outside world. Can you do that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I chuckled lightly. “Sure. I will let them know how terrifying the outside world is. I will shatter their desire for the outside world! They don’t know how fortunate and happy their lives are here!” Guilt sprouted in me for all the fragile hearts I would later break.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah. Thank you, kid.” The robot spread its wings and left.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I stood up and patted the sand off me, smiling. After half a year, I could finally go onto that island. On top of that, I got such an interesting task.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I would let them know how cruel the outside world was!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As I walked into the water, I turned back to look at the island I lived on. It gave me a feeling of home because I’d built it on my own, bit by bit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I’d used the things that they had given me and filled the pit gradually. It was just like my room. I developed an indescribable reliance towards it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie stood up from the water and came next to me. Seawater rolled down along his neck under the moonlight. Rivulets rolled down his clear greenish skin, passing his defined chest muscles and slender belly button to fall back into the water.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was considered brawny among water ghosts. Standing next to me, he looked twice my size</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ghostie, we are going to live on the island. Don’t scare people.” I had never seen the people on the island. All along I had only been talking to robot birds.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Ghostie broke into a smile and revealed his mouthful of sharp teeth. His bulging eyes made his smile look even more malicious. It was as though he was saying,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">That’s impossible. I want to scare them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the second day, someone came to take us. It was a boat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The boat stopped by the side of the island and I boarded the boat. The boat brought me to the huge Hagrid Island while Ghostie swam next to me. When we were about to reach the island, he submerged into the water.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As I got closer, I saw the palace-like buildings on the island. There were sky gardens that were connected together. They even had flowing fountains and abundant flowers. It looked just like heaven.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the shore, there seemed to be a port that was built out of glass. A few boats were parked around the glass deck.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Crowds gathered at the shore, all wearing long silver coats of similar designs that seemed elegant.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were a few people standing alone, surrounding a wheelchair. In the wheelchair was a silver-haired lady, who smiled at me as she nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was her, the master of Hagrid Island, the old grandma.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I got off the boat and stepped onto the transparent glass deck. I walked towards her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">People around me were curious. The children leaned against their parents as they watched me inquisitively.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The number of males and females was quite balanced. Hence, they weren’t surprised that I was a girl.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I only looked at the grandma but didn’t pay much attention to the people standing behind her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I walked before her. “Thank you for letting me onto this island.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She wore a gentle smile across her worn face. “Welcome to Hagrid Island, Luo Bing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The surrounding crowd applauded. It was a welcoming applause.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is Xing Ya,” she pointed to her right. Then, a young lady about my age jumped happily before me. Just as I had imagined, she was cute-looking with a pair of big eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hi! Luo Bing, let me show you around later!” She was so excited.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is my great-grandchild, Xing Chuan.” She pointed to the right as she stared into my eyes. I knew that she was hinting at me to not behave unusually.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I calmed myself down and looked up to the right. He was really Xing Chuan!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But he had short hair and he wore a solemn expression. He nodded at me, which I considered as a greeting.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I nodded too. Then, I looked at the woman next to him. As expected, she looked exactly the same as the AI Silver Moon. She was Elena!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan had said that Silver Moon was designed according to Elena’s image.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The woman who stood next to Xing Chuan now was a real person in reality, the real Elena.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hello, I am Elena.” Elena smiled at me. She was a gentle woman.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hello.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, I saw a few middle-aged couples and a few older couples. They all looked friendly as they smiled at me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Grandma! I’m bringing Luo Bing around!” Xing Ya pulled me and started running.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old grandma nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ya, be careful. Don’t be in a hurry,” Xing Chuan reminded hastily like a worried brother. From his gaze, I could tell that he was still keeping his guard up against me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The warm sea breeze blew and my fringe fluttered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It was the first time I was able to face Xing Chuan so calmly. Of course, he was a different Xing Chuan.</span></p>
