 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xiao Ye’s space transfer superpower was very practical.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just then, Sis Ceci and Uncle Mason ran out through the entrance too. They had packed lighly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sis Cannon and the others came out after them. They looked at Sis Ceci and Uncle Mason in shock.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Officer Mason! Sis Ceci!” Sis Cannon, Xue Gie, Ming You, Xiao Ying, Khai, Williams, Sia, Joe, and the others surrounded them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bring us along too! Why didn’t you inform us?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m going to pack my bag now!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stop right there!” Uncle Mason bellowed, and everyone stopped. The city gate fell silent, and everyone looked anxious and confused.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Elder Alufa slowly walked out of Noah City with Arsenal, Mosie, and Brother Qian Li. There were more people behind them who looked at Sis Ceci and Uncle Mason with confusion, seeming loath to part with them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arsenal and Brother Qian Li helped Elder Alufa as he walked out of the city gate. Sis Shirley quickly turned away when she saw him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Uncle Mason and Sis Ceci bowed at Elder Alufa politely. Then, they looked at Sis Cannon and the rest of the members sternly and exhorted, “Noah City needs you to safeguard it! Your children need your companionship too! Don’t make them go through the same loneliness and pain you experienced...”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Uncle Mason’s last words brought about sorrow in the warm breeze. They had no one to leave behind because they had lost Harry. But these people still had children waiting to be fed, just like when Sis Shirley had left Xue Gie. So, Xue Gie and the others couldn’t leave. No one could guarantee that they would return alive.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I!” Xue Gie stood up, and Sis Shirley pulled her back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sis Shirley lowered her head and held Xue Gie tightly. “No one would thank you for your sacrifice! People in this world only care about their own survival!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Xue Gie...” Bill held Xue Gie and shook his head with a conflicted expression. “Think about our child...”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xue Gie hung her head low and slowly retreated into the crowd.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sis Shirley looked at Pelos sternly as he stood behind me. “You too! Come back with your dad! Do you hear me?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pelos scratched his head and looked elsewhere. “Oh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were many of Pelos’ friends among the crowd. They looked tempted. Angelina was there too. She looked at Pelos with concern as though she had guessed something. Pelos immediately moved behind me as though he were trying to use my body to block Angelina’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain, I want to go with you!” Xiao Ying suddenly took a step forward. “I don’t have a baby. I am willing to!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at Xiao Ying and she broke into a smile. She turned and winked at everyone else, saying, “I’m going on behalf of all of you!” What Xiao Ying said comforted Xue Gie and the other members. They looked at her simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sis Cannon hugged Xiao Ying and encouraged her, saying, “Work hard! Don’t embarrass the Desert Rose team!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Xiao Ying, you represent all of us now!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Xiao Ying! Then, we are going too!” Joe and Sia immediately ran out. “We’ll pack our bags now!” The two of them pushed through the crowd and ran into Noah City.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xiao Ying turned to look at me. “Captain, you can’t say no! I am definitely following you!” She pounced and hugged me from the side. My arm fell into her massive cleavage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I reckoned I wouldn’t be able to shake off Xiao Ying. Plus, her superpower was unique. She could go anywhere through an electrical cable, so she would be much safer than most of us.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lil’ Bing...” Elder Alufa walked towards me. He looked like he had aged a lot over the few days, and he was no longer as energetic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I came forward, saying, “I’m sorry, Elder Alufa.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry...” Elder Alufa apologized with his hoarse voice. “We disappointed you...” He looked at the city gate of Noah City behind him and continued, “Noah City was originally a military base. We concealed her shine...” Elder Alufa turned back and looked at me. “I hope that you will bring Noah out from underground, so she can do what she must.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was stunned, and I immediately looked at Arsenal. She looked away, while Ming You looked at Arsenal anxiously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Elder Alufa had said such a thing in front of everyone. It simply meant that he was giving Noah to me. It was a great blow to the current master of Noah City, Arsenal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at Elder Alufa again, saying, “Elder Alufa, Noah belongs to you. I couldn’t and I wouldn’t take it away. You need her to protect you. I will come and borrow her if I need her, but Noah belongs to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Elder Alufa’s eyes glistened with tears. He nodded sadly and smiled gratefully. He placed his hands on my shoulders and said, “Lil’ Bing, you will definitely be a Queen. You will...”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I smiled at him and turned to look at Raffles, Pelos, Gru, Ah Zong, and the rest, saying, “Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!” They were full of vigor under the sunny sky. The breeze that came from the horizon rustled their many-colored hair. They had become my first troop, and I believed that my troop would only continue to grow stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, Sis Ceci, Uncle Mason, Xiao Ying, Sia, and Joe followed me and left Noah City. They had left their home.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the battleship took off, I saw Elder Alufa and the people of Noah City waving goodbye on the screen in front of me. A surge of emotions filled my heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s another city here!” Gehenna exclaimed next to me. We sat in the positions of the spaceship captain and vice-captain respectively. &nbsp;At the front, Vanish, Earl, Nino, Nathan, and Blue Feather were piloting the spaceship, while Old Iron sat by the side with a bandage on his arm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the other side, Uncle Mason, Sis Ceci, Raffles, Ah Zong, and the rest sat around the console. Gru, Pelos, and Lucifer were watching them closely, observing how to control the spaceship.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Uncle Mason and Sis Ceci were shocked when they saw Gehenna and the others. They were dumbfounded. They had never expected that I wanted to go to Ghost Eclipser territory. On top of that, I was already working together with Ghost Eclipsers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These once sworn enemies were now seated together. The mood in the spaceship was strange and awkward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, this spaceship was merely the beginning. One day in the future, after someone united the world, we would coexist under the same blue sky with the Ghost Eclipsers. It was only a matter of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go!” I commanded, and the spaceship shot forward at full speed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">What should I do? I have no idea yet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">But I believe that I will know what I should do when I see it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">I am no longer the future star of Noah City, nor the North Star of Silver Moon City. I am also not part of the allied army of the Aurora Legion. I am me. I am Luo Bing, and I have a unique troop...</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">No, the word is ‘us’. We are a brand new force in this world!</span></p>
