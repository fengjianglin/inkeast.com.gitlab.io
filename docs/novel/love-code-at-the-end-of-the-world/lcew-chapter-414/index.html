 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles admired and looked highly upon Cang Yu.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Stunned, Raffles immediately looked at me. “I’m sorry, Lil Bing. That’s not what I mean. As long as it is alive, it has the right to live in this world.” He held my hand tightly. He seemed to be afraid that I would get angry at him again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I smiled and shook my head. I glanced at Xing Chuan’s room. “Snowball.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A huge white figure slowly jumped in from Xing Chuan’s room. It was already the size of a cat now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing Snowball, Raffles’ gaze turned gentle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I understand how Snowball came about now.” I picked up the fluffy Snowball. “Because it was also created like that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I’d found it strange back then.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">How could Snowball suddenly appear in this Silver Moon City that never had any animals?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Now</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;I understood. It only took a month to create a human, let alone a bunny.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When life comes about so casually, what kind of feelings would we have towards lives?” I said gently with Snowball in my arms. “It’s because life comes about with difficulty, that we love and care for living things. If life comes about so easily, we wouldn’t be sad when it passes too.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I stood up again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, Raffles hugged me tightly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lil Bing, can I sleep next to you tonight?” He leaned on my back gently as he spoke, as though he was afraid that I would disappear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I blushed and recalled the night before I’d left Noah City.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Mm</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.” I nodded. I couldn’t reject Raffles’s request.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">We lay down on the bed. He lay next to me happily and kept looking at me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I turned to face him too. “Raffles, are you willing to return to Noah City after this war?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles’ expression froze for a moment, and a light flashed in his eyes. He looked down, his long eyelashes shielding his gaze. “Wherever you are… that’s where I will be?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles definitely didn’t want to return to Noah City.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was just like a person who had left his village to finally arrive at the top science school. Who would be willing to return to the village?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Silver Moon City was an irresistible temptation to Raffles. It was like a drug that Raffles was addicted to and loathed to part with.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I turned my back to Raffles. “I hope the war ends soon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>He gently hugged my body and leaned against my back. “</span><span style="font-style: italic">Mm</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Scribble.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” I heard scribbling noises again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I opened my eyes and saw Raffles paced back and forth in the room while he wrote. He was mumbling to himself softly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, no. Using medication to stimulate superpower evolution won’t work. It must be a personal breakthrough,” he mumbled as he wrote. He looked at his notebook. “Yes, everything you said is feasible but the usage of medication is too dangerous.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I closed my eyes wearily.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Who is Raffles talking to?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When I woke up the next morning, Raffles was sitting on the day bed while folding the clean laundry. He looked equally focused and serious when doing house chores as when he was doing an experiment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I remembered how he’d used to look feminine back then, with his long hair hanging low while he was doing house chores, like a gentle elder sister.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Raffles, who were you talking to last night?” I asked curiously because I’d heard him saying,</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">&nbsp;‘Everything you said is feasible.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles’ hand trembled and he blinked. “Nobody.” He smiled and looked at me. “Did I wake you up last night?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I shook my head, confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Did I hear wrongly?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at Kansa Star outside the window. “When do you think Harry will return?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His hand that was folding the clean laundry paused. “Very soon, I guess. They have been fighting the war for very long. Maybe he will be back on the next spaceship.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Mm</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!” The moment I thought about Harry’s return, I immediately became happy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles slowly put down the clothes in his hand and stood up. He walked before me with his head hung low.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lil Bing,” he called me softly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked up at him, “What’s the matter? Raff…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, he leaned down towards me, cutting off the sunlight between us. He kissed me on my lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at him in surprise. Just as I raised my hand to shove him off, he suddenly locked my hands and pushed me down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>*Bang!*</span><span>&nbsp;He pushed me down onto the bed. “</span><span style="font-style: italic">Mm</span><span>!” My lips parted due to the shock and his tongue slipped into my mouth. I was so shocked that I didn’t move an inch.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Raffles kissed me so forcefully.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Mm</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!” I began to struggle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, he only gripped my hand even tighter. He pressed me down on the bed with his full strength. Kissing me deeply, his tongue swept inside my mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His breathing became heavier, his chest heaving up and down against my body. His legs began to squeeze in between my legs. I was frightened by Raffles being like this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Mm</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!” I lifted my leg and locked him in place. Then, I twisted my waist and instantly flipped him under me instead. As a result, I pressed his hands that were locked around mine onto the bed too.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Raffles!” My lips were burning numb as though chili powder had been rubbed all over it. I really couldn’t believe that Raffles would treat me like that.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His eyelashes quivered and he slowly opened his eyes. His eyes were trembling with burning desire before me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He blinked, his grayish-blue eyes dilated. At once his eyes flickered, like the usual Raffles with low self-esteem. He avoided my surprised gaze. “Sor-, sorry. I, I…” His face instantly turned red like brilliant roses blooming under his skin, tinting his body with crimson.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He didn’t dare to look at me, and yet just now he!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles loved me. His actions just now… seemed normal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just like the day when I’d left Noah City, he’d kissed me in front of everyone. But it hadn’t been as vigorous and forceful as just now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In a split second, I found the Raffles who’d kept me company day and night suddenly unfamiliar. It was as though the Raffles earlier wasn’t actually Raffles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I felt that something wasn’t right. It didn’t feel like that was something Raffles would have done. If he had found it difficult to hold himself back, he could have shown it the night before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But he hadn’t. He had never gotten close to me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since he‘d found out that I’d gotten together with Harry, I could feel that he’d kept his distance with me. Besides his request to sleep next to me the night before, he’d never shown any more intimate behaviors beyond holding my hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>He’d said that he was happy that Harry and I had gotten together and that our relationship wouldn’t change. However, what had happened between me and Harry had caused a great commotion in the depths of his heart. He’d become the sensitive and fearful Raffles with low self-esteem.</span></p>
