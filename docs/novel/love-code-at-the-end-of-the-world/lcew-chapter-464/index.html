 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was instantly a drastic change in the Ghost Eclipsers’ expressions. They became terrified and fearful because they saw the two spirits, Jun and Zong Ben!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I raised my hand and said, “I want their spaceships. Go!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jun and Zong Ben immediately charged out. The two metahumans shouted hysterically, “Ah! Spirits!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As they shouted, I leaped out in between Jun and Zong Ben as they plunged out too. I put down my face shield and activated the light gun in my hands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was a miserable, shrill scream in the air. Then, there were ashes and debris of torn clothes fluttering down on both sides.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jun and Zong Ben were two portable blue crystal energy spirits. As they plunged through the spaceships, they sucked away all the blue crystal energy. Similarly, when they plunged through humans, humans would turn into ashes and would vanish.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My superpower was similar to theirs, but I maintained a human form, and they didn’t.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I plunged at high speed and entered the huge opening. I saw the remains of robot birds all across the surface of the sea. There was the aircraft that they had used for repairing the opening. In the churning sea, I could see the engineers who had fallen and died. The pieces of their dead bodies tainted the seawater in red. It was a heart-wrenching sight!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wherever the Ghost Eclipsers went, they brought massacre.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were the true definition of a slaughterman and a demon!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What disgusted me the most was that I could see the Ghost Eclipsers chasing after girls on Hagrid Island. They treated the girls like toys and tore their clothes—the entire Hagrid Island was filled with hysterical screams of the girls.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The men were tied up and placed by the beach. I saw many guys from the training, and they were covered in wounds and bloodstains.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guys who were yet to be caught continued to fight. However, the Ghost Eclipsers, who had more battle experience, seized them. Some were even thrown in the air like toys.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The entire Hagrid Island was in a mess.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Two Ghost Eclipsers were hovering in the air. They should be the decision-makers of the battle, and also their captains. The two Ghost Eclipsers had obviously noticed that the people on Hagrid Island were only ordinary and had no backup. Hence, they were still joking casually.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We made a fortune! We found such a treasure! They are all ordinary people! Hahahaha! Look, our brothers are having so much fun!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s head down too. The women here are beautiful and curvy. Look! See how fair their skins are! I have never seen such beautiful women in my entire life!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Look at you. You are drooling!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have a hard-on! Oh no. I can’t hold back anymore!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As they were grabbing their lower bodies, I withdrew my lightsaber. Just like how I had told Xing Chuan and the other guys, it was needless to see their appearance and their superpower but just give them a headshot directly or chop their heads off!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The moment my lightsaber was activated, I shuttled through them quickly. When they looked at me subconsciously, I had already slit their necks with my lightsaber.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their eyes were wide open, and the next moment, their heads fell off their necks and descended from the high sky alongside me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">“Bang!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">“Bang!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two heads landed on the beach with me, and it instantly caught the attention of the people on Hagrid Island who were tied up on the nearby beach and the Ghost Eclipsers. In an instant, the entire coast was pitch silent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, I didn’t give them a chance to see what was going on, and I changed my lightsaber into a light gun and shot all the Ghost Eclipsers, who were capturing the men and chasing after the women, in their heads.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The best part about the light gun was that it could shoot far distance, and it was fast. I couldn’t manage to count how many people were there, but I killed whoever was in front of me. In the blink of an eye, three enemies fell. They didn’t even have the chance to shout. Even the Ghost Eclipsers who were chasing the girls didn’t notice that their comrades behind them were all killed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I immediately took huge strides forward and shot with two guns simultaneously.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">“Bang!” “Bang!” “Bang!” “Bang!”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Those who lay above the girls and those who chased after the girls all fell as I shot them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Ghost Eclipsers slowly fell next to me with the gunshots and rolled by the girls’ sides. Blood flowed out from their heads. From the corner of my eyes, I saw someone flying up, and I raised my hand and shot him with my sixth sense. He landed into the sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My sixth sense grew stronger over time, as the fight would start. My superpower would also grow stronger, along with my sixth sense. I became extremely sharp! I felt a murderous vibe behind me, and I immediately turned around. Without looking at who it was, I shot because it was my gut feeling. One second’s hesitation in the war would kill me, overturning the battle outcome.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The entire beach became quiet, and there were no Ghost Eclipsers left to fight!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I clenched on my light gun and looked around with my guards up. Besides the people from Hagrid Island who looked at me in terror, there was no other Ghost Eclipser!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah! Let go of me! No!” I heard Elena’s voice, and I immediately went forward. I raised my gun and aimed at the ugly Ghost Eclipser’s head, who lay on top of Elena.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Ghost Eclipsers had put down the guards as all the people on Hagrid Island were ordinary. They were busy having fun because they had not anticipated the presence of a meta-human among their victims.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey!” I shouted, and the face shield disappeared from the front of my face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Ghost Eclipser’s lower body was exposed, and his waxy butt was raised high. He was tearing off Elena’s clothes, and Elena’s hair was all over the place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He immediately stiffened. When he turned to look at me, I shot him. In an instant, the blood splashed on Elena’s tearful face. Her pupils dilated in shock, and she looked in the air blankly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Ghost Eclipser fell from her body. I glared at Xing Chuan’s army among the men in Hagrid Island behind me. Then, I roared, “What did I teach you?! Don’t look but just give them a headshot! You survived by sheer luck! Today’s damage is due to your laziness!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guys lowered their heads in embarrassment, and there was anger churning in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you doing standing there?! Search the entire island! Kill every Ghost Eclipser!” I roared at them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They immediately stood up and picked up guns from the Ghost Eclipsers I had killed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I commanded again, “Shoot as soon as you see one. Do you understand?! Don’t keep anyone alive!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!” The guys replied loudly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah!” Suddenly, Elena roared. She took the light gun from my hand and shot the dead Ghost Eclipser continuously. She shot him into a beehive, and the blood tainted the sandy beach.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The entire beach was quiet. The girls hugged together and cried.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I creased my eyebrows and pressed on Elena’s hand that pulled the trigger. Her body was shivering. Her clothes were torn apart. Her shoulders and half her boobs were exposed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at the guys, “Search!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The guys immediately dispersed and ran around Hagrid Island to search.</span></p>
