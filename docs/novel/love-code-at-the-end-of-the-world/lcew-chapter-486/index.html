 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie blinked and climbed towards me. He sat by my side, looking at me warily. He lifted his hand to poke me softly, as if asking me what happened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Everyone thought it was a natural disaster, but Professor Yin Yue told me today that it was…” I turned to look at Ghostie. His amber eyes were shimmering with curiosity under the moonlight. “A weapon…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie’s pupils grew wide. His mind seemed to have blanked and he was stunned, looking like a wooden chicken.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hagrid Jones wanted to use death to stimulate human evolution. In the cruel race of ‘survival of the fittest’, he left humanity two outcomes: Die, or... evolve into metahumans.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie’s chest started heaving. He clenched his claws with anger, a mixture of disgust and confusion on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So, what has become of this world?” I chuckled lightly and looked far away. “Sixty years of chaos, with humans killing one another left and right. Does anyone realize that there’s no point to any of this? The Ghost Eclipsers, metahumans, day monsters, flying corpses, and even you, are all victims!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">“Thud!”</span><span>&nbsp;Ghostie stabbed his claws into the sand angrily.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">“Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;He continuously stabbed the sand as if it were Hagrid Jones’s body and he was trying to fill it with a thousand holes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, Ghostie panted as he sat on the beach that was now full of sand pits. He suddenly filled in the holes one by one and started drawing on the surface with his sharp claws.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I looked at him in surprise.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">He can actually write!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wrote: “How did Professor Yin Yue know about this?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He drew a huge exclamation mark to show his anger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But I couldn’t think about answering his question. I only looked at him and asked, “You can write?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was stunned. He immediately hid his hands and looked away anxiously, his gaze flicking from side to side. Then he continued to poke at his question with his hand, as if he wanted me to focus on his question rather than the fact that he could write.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You can write! You can actually write!” I grabbed his shoulder and said, “Why didn’t you tell me earlier!? Do you know how many questions I have for you?!” I shook him really hard. He continued to poke the words on the sand, which were beginning to fade from being disturbed so many times.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I sighed and let him go. “Because Professor Yin Yue is Hagrid Jones’s wife.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie began to look like a wooden chicken again after I answered him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">We sat on the beach quietly for a very long time, until the sky turned light.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">“Wuwu...”</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Hagrid Island was filled with the sound of weeping. The same people who had partied all night long ran out from the palace.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thee men and women in formal attire were rushing to the top of the mountain in silence. They looked like a long, colorful ribbon fluttering in the air.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go!” I stood up and walked to the trestle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie came back to reality and followed behind me bleakly. There was still anger written across his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I said, “Professor Yin Yue passed away.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He paused and stood under the pale morning light.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I hopped onto a small boat when I reached the trestle. Ghostie hung his head low and stood by the shore. His body was stiff with anger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Luo Bing!” Xing Chuan yelled as he ran over. Ghostie wanted to charge at Xing Chuan the moment he saw him, but I immediately shouted, “Ghostie! They are all innocent! They don’t know anything!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie and Xing Chuan stopped at the same time. Xing Chuan was confused, and Ghostie was enraged.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie paced back and forth angrily. He clutched his head as if he were going mad.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan came forward and asked worriedly, “Ghostie, what’s wrong with you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, Ghostie opened his mouth wide and wailed, sounding like a whale’s tragic cry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That deafening wail could pierce the heart and drive a person to tears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie dived into the water and vanished from sight, leaving Xing Chuan on the shore in a stupor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Indeed, the people of this world wouldn’t forgive anyone related to Hagrid Jones.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since Professor Yin Yue was Hagrid Jones’s wife, Ghostie knew that Xing Chuan was the descendant of Hagrid Jones. He was the descendant of the devil who had destroyed the world.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan hurried forward and looked at me worriedly, asking, “What happened to Ghostie? Also, why didn’t you show up last night?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at him. I was speechless because I didn’t know what to tell him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His expression looked complicated. He said, “Grandma passed away... Can you…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know.” I lifted my head to look at him. He was still on the glass trestle, in his suit from the night before. He looked like a crystal prince. “I was with her last night. I sent her off.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan was surprised. The crystal clear, shimmering morning light poured onto his face. He was such a pure boy, his heart as beautiful as crystal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Under Professor Yin Yue’s leadership, the people of Hagrid Island had retained the most beautiful aspects of humanity. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Su Yang and Xing Chuan, who had followed Hagrid Jones, had become weapons for war.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was why Professor Yin Yue hated Professor Hagrid Jones. She hated that he had never changed, and there was no love in his heart for anything other than his research.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Professor Yin Yue had been like an angel who loved her own children and Hagrid Island.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“She probably didn’t want you to be sad and not enjoy the party. That’s why you were only informed now.” I lowered my face in pain. Xing Chuan’s bereaved expression was vaguely reflected in the glass. “Was Grandma in pain when she departed?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“She passed on peacefully with a smile. I am leaving now,” I said and started the boat. “I’m not used to farewells, and I don’t want to see Xing Ya and Elena cry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xing Chuan didn’t say anything, but just stood on the trestle quietly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My boat slowly left the shore and left the crystal prince on the trestle. The boat began to pick up speed and the wind billowed around my skirt and my long hair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I would likely never return.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, Xing Chuan’s voice travelled from far away. “Luo Bing, I love you! You must come back and visit us!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I didn’t look back, but instead continued forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Xing Chuan, I won’t be back. I promised Professor Yin Yue I would keep this secret. You can’t be discovered by the outside world. You would encounter unprecedented danger if you were to be discovered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie’s fit figure leapt out from the water ahead. He was like a dolphin as he traveled quickly through the clear ocean. The water splashing behind him glimmered in the sunlight every time he left the water. No doubt he wanted to leave Hagrid Island even sooner than I did.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Such a horrid secret had been kept in a dreamy paradise like Hagrid Island. Outside this pure paradise was the rest of Kansas Star, a world bathed in blood and paved with bones.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Xing Chuan, Xing Ya, Elena - all of you must stay in this heaven forever, as you are the descendants of the devil.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghostie hopped onto the beach and pulled my boat onto the shore. His anger had turned into strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I hopped off the small boat. Our spaceship was covered well with a shield, like a bride waiting for her husband to lift her veil.</span></p>
