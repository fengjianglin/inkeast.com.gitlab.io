 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He opened his eyes and smiled gently, saying, “You’re welcome to use me, Master. You don’t have to be gentle with me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I smiled and held the lever. “Play some music, b*tch.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sure!” Upbeat music filled the cockpit as Ice Dragon and I plunged into the boundless darkness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The vast starry sky was above me. The night sky was especially clear, and the galaxy above was extremely brilliant. Flying beneath the stars like this had a uniquely romantic atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It gave me a sense of security that had been missing for too long. I was piloting my own spaceship, feeling as though I were reading on my bed. It was a feeling I never had when I was in other spaceships.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Lil’ Bing,” Raffles’ voice suddenly resounded from the control panel as Ice Dragon connected the video feed. Behind him, I could see Moto trying to familiarize himself with the superconnection robot. Moto seemed nervous, as if it were his first time playing an online game. He was nervous, curious, and panicky. He seemed frightened and screamed occasionally.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Raffles is so amazing. Since when has he been hiding a superconnection robot? Or did he make one casually in the past few days?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To me, Raffles was like my Doraemon. He could build anything in an instant.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I forgot to inform you that Jun and Zong Ben are aboard your spaceship. I already installed wings for them. They can now move around freely.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s great!” I said happily. I immediately looked around to see where he’d hidden them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And…” He caught my attention again. He looked at me for a while and smiled bashfully, saying, “I miss you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I immediately blushed and felt something tug on my heartstrings. “I just left…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mm, I know that, but I can’t help but miss you. Haggs is making fun of me too…” He seemed to be angry at himself for behaving like that. He looked up and smiled at me, saying, “I’m helping Moto get used to the robot. I’ll only see you again in a few hours’ time. Love you.” He kissed the screen, and it felt almost sickeningly sweet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, Raffles is getting really clingy~” Ice Dragon’s cunning face replaced Raffles’ on the screen. He was wearing his fox-like smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at him and asked, “Raffles said that Jun and Zong Ben are aboard the spaceship. Where are they?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh! Here.” Suddenly, a recess opened in one of the walls. There were two heart-shaped metal objects, one black and one white, lying inside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I forgot we had two more passengers.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No way!” I looked at the two small heart-shaped objects and exclaimed in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It seemed that my exclamation had frightened them, and they immediately hovered in the air. “</span><span style="font-style: italic">Cling!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” They revealed a pair of metallic wings each!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The winged hearts looked about the size of an ordinary scouting robot. But when they spread their wings, I could see how exquisite these robots were.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, the centers of the heart-shaped objects glowed blue. The exquisite mechanisms began to spin, and they began to take the shape of miniature angels. This sort of transformation technique came from Silver Moon City.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The miniature robots’ chests glowed, and I could see the blue crystal energy within. Raffles had separated Jun and Zong Ben! He’d given each of them a container, and there was no radiation leaking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jun and Zong Ben flew up to me and I watched them closely. The parts inside were fine and expertly made. I couldn’t help but admire Raffles’s uncanny workmanship.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This container for spirits was one-way. As they were made of blue crystal energy themselves, they would be sealed off too whenever blue crystal energy was isolated. That was also the reason why they couldn’t pass through the energy walls in the centers of the radiation zones.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Back then, the heart-shaped container I’d brought out had turned out to be an anti-radiation container that could seal in blue crystal energy. That was why Jun and Zong Ben hadn’t been able to come out by themselves, even if they could communicate with me through dreams. Every time, they’d only come out when I opened the heart-shaped container from outside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Now, though, these two robots were so delicate. I didn’t even know how to open this even finer heart-shaped container.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">How do I let them out?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where’s the switch?” I looked at and asked Ice Dragon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Master, they can open it by themselves,” Ice Dragon said, smiling. “It’s like a doorknob. That was originally installed on the outside, but now it’s installed on the inside. They can control it with their willpower, and they can open it anytime. They’re free now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at Jun and Zong Ben flying around next to me and I was thrilled, excitedly saying, “That’s great!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They flew around me and formed a heart shape. They flapped their wings and stopped on the armrests on both sides.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Raffles had even engraved their names on them:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Jun, Zong Ben.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The white one was Jun’s, while the black one was Zong Ben’s.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raffles had heard me talking about them. I’d told him that Jun was as warm as the sun. Without Jun, I couldn’t walk out of the shadows.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zong Ben was like the devil. Without his reverse psychology and provocation, I couldn’t recover my composure as quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Maybe that was why Raffles had designed them as one white and one black heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You haven’t been charging for very long. Let’s head to the desert sea historical site,” I said to them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They took off again, sticking to the windshield in front. It seemed that Raffles had installed quite a number of functions for them. They were like robots with consciousness, and could move around freely. Raffles had really made my dream come true, as well as Jun’s and Zong Ben’s.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The spaceship instantly sped up and advanced even faster! Very soon, &nbsp;the desert sea appeared in front of us.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The desert sea had once been a tourist attraction for those who liked deserts and extreme sports. It was called a desert sea because the desert was filled with miniature water pits. During the rainy season, the water pits would connect and form an ocean. During a drought, they would separate again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The desert at night merged into the darkness of the horizon. In the distance, there was a cloud of gentle blue light. The scariest place in the world was the most beautiful place at night. It shimmered like a blue gemstone under the moonlight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jun, Zong Ben, did you notice that the centers of the radiation zones used to be capital cities in the past? For example: Kro, Raffles City, the music city, the cultural city, your arts city, and various military and cultural zones... Back then, I thought it was a coincidence. But this time, we’re in a desert…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jun and Zong Ben turned to look at me. Their exquisite features revealed their suspicion and doubt as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The spaceship began to descend in front of the familiar wall. Ice Dragon opened the hatch and I jumped out, Jun and Zong Ben following me outside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">We stood before the protective wall that looked like a huge colorful soap bubble. The wall gave me an indescribable sense of belonging.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The centers of the radiation zones gave me a sense of security. No one could hurt me here. Not even any weapon.</span></p>
