 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I couldn’t believe that the person Xing Chuan was mortally afraid of was His Highness Cang Yu. So, I had to keep my distance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gale looked at me sadly, “Luo Bing…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“North Star…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“North Star!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I walked quickly as people called.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sharjah suddenly stopped me and reminded me, “Only His Highness Cang Yu knows His Highness Xing Chuan’s whereabouts."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I nodded. “I will go and look for him now. Don’t worry."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We will leave His Highness into your hands.” Sharjah looked at me solemnly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mm.” I walked onto the elevator on the field. As the elevator descended, everyone swarmed over. They needed their Highness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I walked to the garden library directly, where His Highness&nbsp;</span><span>Cang Yu</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;usually read his books, but he wasn’t there. On the coffee table, there was hot tea that was giving out steam as usual. He shouldn’t be far.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I continued to look for him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was His Highness Cang Yu’s place. Hence, besides my room and the garden library, I had never wandered around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just as I was searching, I realized that the garden library actually stretched very deep and it was really old.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I heard the sound of running water ahead of me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When I walked out of the bookshelves entwined with tree vines, there was an indoor mountain hot spring. The spring water was showering from the man-made mountain by the side, forming a small waterfall. It poured down from the mountain wall, and the scenery looked extremely beautiful.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The steam from the spring water had filled the place, putting on a veil over the surrounding flowers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Do you want to come in and join me?” Suddenly, His Highness&nbsp;</span><span>Cang</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Yu asked me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I subconsciously looked in the direction of his voice and saw His Highness Cang&nbsp;</span><span>Yu in</span><span>&nbsp;the bathi</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ng pool.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I retreated in fear. I quickly looked away from his body. In a mere glance, I had seen His Highness Cang Yu’s well-built body and his distinct muscles. I had never expected His Highness&nbsp;</span><span>Cang Yu</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to have such a toned body under the slender long robe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His deep merman lines and muscular abs would make one’s heart race. I was surprised at his muscular, sexy body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He looked like a scholarly wise man but he bore the body of a general.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I stood before him and suddenly felt small. I even felt dependent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He maintained his elegance and leisurely attitude. There was a tray floating on the surface of the water and on it was his favorite hot tea. He leaned against the side of the pool as he continued to read without looking at me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Highness Cang Yu, I plead to be permitted to look for His Highness Xing Chuan.” I lowered my face and didn’t look at him sitting in the water.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You forgave him so quickly?” He extended his hand to pick up his teacup and drank from it elegantly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I did not forgive him,” I said directly. “However, I know that the future war needs his return.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wait until you forgive him, and then you can go and look for him,” Cang Yu said calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Highness Cang Yu!” I looked at him anxiously. “You can’t force me to forgive him!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He looked up from his teacup and fixed his gaze upon my face. He lifted the corners of his lips into a smile. “Luo Bing, you are a man. You like men too. Then why do you mind that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I creased my eyebrows and looked away with rage. “I am a man and I do like men. However, I do not like to have sex with just anyone.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Humph…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” He put down his teacup and slowly flipped his book. “You and Xing Chuan are similar. You have OCD for your emotions, your bodies and your desires. This is because you are yearning for an innocent and beautiful relationship…” He squinted his eyes and looked far away. “Xing Chuan is dying for a relationship, he is dying for your love and warmth…"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I got goosebumps and I rubbed my arm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“However, it is obvious that you are not interested in him… Your refusal made his desire stronger…” He stood up and I could hear the water splash.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I quickly turned around and saw the bathing robe hanging on the tree branch in front of me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pass me the bathing robe,” he said gently as he approached my back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The bathing robe was within my reach. When I took it and turned around, he spread his arms with his back facing me. He obviously wanted me to put it on for him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His arms were long and toned, and his back muscles were exposed clearly in front of me. The water flowed down the muscles across his firm waist to the gulley in between his two toned butt cheeks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My heart clenched and I looked away as I put on the bathing robe for him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He turned around and I instantly tensed up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He tied his belt, but the chest area of the robe spread and revealed his sexy muscles. He hung his long braid in front of his chest and looked at me with a gentle gaze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Would you like to listen to my advice?” He asked gently.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at him and he bent down with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I took a step back and he stopped. He smiled at me. “Have sex with him and he will be satisfied.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at him in shock. He stood straight and flashed an unfathomable smile. “As you are a man, you should know that a man would explode after holding himself back for too long…” He slowly looked down and his gaze swept past my neck. He extended his hand and I immediately moved back again. He smiled and retracted his hand. “Last night should have been very exciting, huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I instantly blushed. I couldn’t help but retreat again. Suddenly, my foot reached nothing and I fell back.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">“Ah!” “Bang!”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I fell and sat on the edge of the bathing pool which was shallow. Half of my body was instantly drenched.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I supported myself in the bathing pool as I looked at Cang Yu looking at me casually. Somehow, my heart started racing at his gaze that seemed to look through everything.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He smiled and looked at me for a while. He raised his hand and the tray that was floating on the water floated towards me. Besides his tea, there was also the golden moon badge on the tray.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Next time, don’t give it to anyone else. This is what I have given to you. It represents the highest authority in&nbsp;</span><span>Silver Moon</span><span>&nbsp;City.” Although his voice was gentle, it was dignified. “Rest well tonight. There’s no hurry to look for Xing Chuan. If he cannot even survive a night on the ground, he is not qualified to be the Highness of&nbsp;</span><span>Silver Moon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;City,” he said sternly and left the bathing pool.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I slowly came back to reality. Cang Yu sounded more like Xing Chuan’s elder brother because he had always said that Xing Chuan didn’t qualify to be the Highness of&nbsp;</span><span>Silver Moon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;City…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I extended my hand to pick up the golden moon badge. I stood up and looked at the badge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Cang Yu was telling me that he wanted me to stay in&nbsp;</span><span>Silver Moon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;City. Just like he had always said that Silver Moon City needed Xing Chuan, he was also hinting to me that it was necessary for me to stay in Silver Moon City because Xing Chuan wanted to have sex with me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hence… I couldn’t take it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I placed the badge on the tray and left the garden library.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The water dripped from my trousers onto the grass. I returned to my room. Looking at the room full of paintings, I picked up the spirit flower.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Every time I complete a painting, some of the flower petals would vanish from the spirit flower. At that time, there were only a few pieces left. Hence, I had to pick another spirit flower before I returned to Noah City so I could keep in contact with Jun and the others.&nbsp;</span></p>
