 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Book 6,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chapter 13 - A Frightening Queen</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I knew that Ghost Eclipsers ate humans. I’d always known.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, when they served me a bloody piece of human meat for real, I’d thought it was a medium-rare beef steak! It was even decorated with flowers by the side too!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dizziness overcame me as my head spun with disgust.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hold it in. Don’t expose that you are not a Ghost Eclipser!” Gehenna muttered as he patted my back. Then, he raised his tone to a soft voice that was still loud enough for everyone to hear him. “My good brother, you can’t be bought over by a piece of steak! She will eat you!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“I won’t.” Margaery placed her hands on her cheeks and said flirtatiously, “I will take care of cutie pies like you. Gehenna, you are quite naughty!” Margaery suddenly glared at Gehenna coldly. “You’re trying to sow discord between me and my cutie pie.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Humph</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!” Then, she smiled at me. “I have something to show you. Do you want to see?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gehenna’s hand that was patting my back stopped and he said anxiously, “Little brother! Don’t go!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Gehenna, shut your mouth!” Margaery suddenly roared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Margaery, I am worried about you!” Gehenna said sincerely. He looked like he was worried that Margaery would die. “My little brother looks cute but he is brutal!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Margaery stood up and walked towards me, emphasizing the lithe lines of her body with each step. In this world that heavily lacked women, her curvy body would make any man be willing to die for her</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She walked before me, leaned down and smiled at me. Her collar dipped, exposing her full snow-white boobs. Gehenna who’d been nervous earlier got distracted and he gulped. “My little brother... my little brother...”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I held Gehenna in contempt. Once he saw a woman’s boobs, he didn’t know how to talk or make a move.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What about your little brother?” Margaery smiled at him before she slowly held my arm to pull me. “Your brother is silly. Follow me.” Margaery pulled me up from my seat and we left the dining hall while Gehenna watched us. He was almost drooling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Margaery hugged my arm. I glanced to either side of me, acting nervous at her closeness. She touched my face with the back of her hand, and I had to look at her. She chuckled flirtatiously. “Little boy, don’t follow Gehenna. His place is filthy and stinky. Do you want to follow me? I will take care of you.” She caressed my face. Her charming eyes showed the gaze of a predator eyeing a delicious prey.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you want to show me?” We arrived at the end of the corridor. There were cabin doors on both sides.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She smiled mysteriously and opened the door next to me. It was an exquisite cabin, renovated into a classic elegant room with an elegant sofa and tea set.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was another door on the other side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She pushed me into the room gently. “Don’t be in a hurry. I am going to show you something great!” Then, she walked into the opposite cabin. The earlier beautiful young men opened the door for her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I glimpsed a spacious room behind the door.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After she entered, the two beautiful young men closed the door. Then, they entered my cabin and closed the door behind them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One of them stood by the door expressionlessly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Another one poured me a cup of tea. “Please wait for the Queen here.” He was the one who had led the way earlier, the young man who’d carried a murderous look.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s your name?” I looked at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He didn’t answer me. He stood by the side after he’d poured me tea, blatantly ignoring me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You carry a murderous look. Why?” I continued to ask.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The murderous look he carried became fiercer and he glared at me.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The originally expressionless young man by the door glanced at him, then looked down. He seemed sad. “We might be dying soon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s the point of you saying that?!” The murderous young man muttered. He narrowed his eyes, which flashed with anxiety.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Moto, you are anxious! Because you know that if the Queen likes him, he will replace one of us!” The young man by the door was a beautiful blonde. His originally expressionless face was instantly replaced with terror as he pointed at me with a trembling hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, I’ll kill him first!” Moto instantly aimed his gun at me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You are mad!” The blonde young man by the door immediately came forward and grabbed his wrist.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t stop me! Eletta!” Moto shoved Eletta away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You kill him now and all of us will die!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ve had enough! I’d rather die!” Moto aimed the gun at me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I watched them calmly and asked, “Why don’t you kill your Queen instead?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Instantly they froze, stunned, a greater fear surfacing in their eyes. They looked even more terrified by what I’d said than by the possibility of being replaced by me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">*Swoosh!* Suddenly, a door on another side opened. Another beautiful young man entered the room, only to be shocked by the scene before him. He immediately shut the door. “Moto! You are crazy! The Queen wants to see him!” The young man quickly pulled Moto away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moto put his hand down. “I’ll die this time. I have had enough.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Moto...” The young man who’d just entered gazed at him in sorrow. He looked at me and pleaded, “I beg you. Pretend nothing happened just now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t think you can be happy when our Queen likes you!” Moto roared at me angrily but there was still fear in his eyes. “It is only a matter of time until you become like us... like us...”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stop!” The beautiful young man covered his mouth in fear. “Please stop!” He looked at me and pleaded again, “Pretend you didn’t see anything. Please. I beg you.” He suddenly knelt down before me and kowtowed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Eletta knelt down in fear too.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moto sat down with a grave face, not uttering another word.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Eletta and the other beautiful young man stood up hastily to open the cabin door for me. They pleaded softly, “Please. You heard nothing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard nothing,” I agreed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Stunned, they looked at me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I walked past them glumly and asked coldly, “Can you become the new Ghost King once you kill the previous one?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They stared at me in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Can you?” I stopped and looked at Eletta.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His face instantly grew pale but he answered subconsciously, “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Alright,” I said and I walked out through the cabin door. It was a bathing pool. The transparent bathing pool was filled with clear water.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Eletta and the beautiful young man quickly hung their heads low and stood next to the shut door as though they were waiting for instructions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You smell bad, like Gehenna and his men.” Margaery suddenly walked out from the other side. She was wearing a layer of thin red gauze. Her curvy and sexy body was vaguely visible under the thin gauze. She came before me barefooted. Touching my face, she said, “Take a shower with me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, she smiled flirtatiously. As she dropped her arms, the thin gauze naturally slid off her body, exposing her equally sexy back and perky butt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her long hair covered her back. The scene was enough to make a man’s blood boil.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Take off his clothes!” Margaery slowly walked into her bathing pool. With every step that she took, bright red liquid rippled from her feet. More blood flowed out from both sides of the pool, instantly tainting the entire bathing pool and covering her snow-white body.</span></p>
