I only knew that I really liked you! I liked you so much that I wanted to make you my wife. I liked you so much that I wanted to see you every morning, to spend every minute and every moment with you. I wanted to see you go to bed every night. I thought you would be my wife.” He was so emotional that his voice was trembling and the letter in his hand was trembling too...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But I was wrong. I actually made you hate me and stay away from me. That had made me panic. Only then I knew that it was love. I was afraid that you would hate me, afraid that you would stay away from me, afraid that you would leave. I was afraid because I loved you and love you. I went crazy on the night you left for Kro. I told myself that I needed to look for you, even if I had to die. I had to look for you no matter what...”</span></p>

He clenched the letter tightly and continued, “You cried that night. I knew I made you cry. I regretted it so much, but at the same time I was also really happy because you had actually cried for me…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I looked at the letter blankly.

But as charming as a Goddess you are, your mission is to bring hope to this world. I knew that Noah City wouldn’t be able to hold you back and it was only a matter of time until you left. So, I thought that if another guy in Noah City could make you stay, as long as there was a guy you love in Noah City, no matter how far you would go, you would eventually come back, to be by my side…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So… You brought Raffles and me together…” Everything had changed since the time we had left during the snowstorm. He had started keeping a distance between us. He had started bringing Raffles along during training. The three of us had begun to hang out together. There was always Raffles between me and him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t hate Raffles and Raffles had liked you for a very long time. Everyone in Noah City could see it but he had low self-esteem, therefore, he couldn’t muster up the courage. He has been treated like a girl since he was young. It was us who made him turn into a coward. So, I felt that I had the responsibility to help him find back his manly confidence. I helped him to go after you. I was happy as long as I could keep your heart in Noah City, no matter who you were with. I could see you everyday…” He stopped for a while and became quiet behind the letter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I looked at the letter which was turning translucent under the lights. He lowered his head behind the letter and continued, “I was in a dilemma. I was in pain as well. My heart hurt and I was jealous when I saw you and Raffles holding hands. How I wish that I could be holding your hands too, walking under the moonlight that never ends. I want to walk across the world, across every corner, spend every minute and seconds with you. But, I knew that you belonged to Raffles and it was me who had made it happen.” Paradoxically, his tone was filled with exhaustion and annoyance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s why when you and Raffles invited me to stay in Love Hut, I knew that I needed to reject the offer, but I moved in anyways because I didn’t want to look at the empty room you used to live in every night and be upset about it. My heart was empty after you left. I told myself that I would stay with you and Raffles until the day both of you chase me out. I would stay by your side as long as both of you didn’t kick me out…”</span></p>

Every single word on the letter became blurry.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Harry has been loving me for so long… Since the first time he met me, he has always loved me…&nbsp;</span></p>

Because we could finally be together, just the two of us. Although you don’t love me nor do you know that I love you, I could stay by your side quietly to protect you and to look after you. I felt very lucky. Then, you began to get angry when the other girls liked me. Do you know how happy I was? I felt that you did that out of jealousy, but I didn’t dare to make wild guesses. I was afraid that you would hate me if I started to assume things…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But you are really driving me crazy the past few days. I don’t understand what you have in mind, what I can do to make you come back to me until… the night when you said that I took advantage of you, I really couldn’t stand it anymore. I must tell you, Lil Bing, I wasn’t taking advantage of you! It is because I love you. That’s why I couldn’t stop myself from clinging on you and touching you! I want to hold your hands, I want to hug your body, I want… to kiss you…” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the letter filled my entire sight. He kissed me with the letter in between our lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Buzz.”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">My brain went blank. It seemed like the surrounding world was swallowed by a white light and there was only Harry right in front of me.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thin letter didn’t isolate the warmth of his lips. The heat transmitted through the letter to my lips. Our lips weren't touching but my lips were numb from it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stroked my face gently with his hands. The letter between us fell down when his lips moved away and revealed his burning gaze that was as deep as the ocean. The quivering tears in his eyes made him look even more charming and it also revealed his sincere and passionate affection.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you aren’t going to hit me…” he mumbled gently on my lips, “I am going to continue…” He slowly closed his eyes and kissed me on my lips again. Our lips touched softly and it instantly took all my strength away like a curse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His soft lips kissed mine gently while his warm hands cupped my face. His golden lashes quivered before my eyes. He opened his mouth slightly and sucked on my lip gently. His soft tongue slid past my lip and left a trail of wetness. He lightly frowned and his breathing became faster. Suddenly, he sucked on my lips and took a deep breath at the tip of my nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And slowly, he let go of my lips. Our lips seemed to be stuck together from being attached for too long and they loathed to part ways.</span></p>
