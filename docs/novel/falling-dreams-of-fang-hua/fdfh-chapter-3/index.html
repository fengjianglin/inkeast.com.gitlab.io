 <p>Chapter 3: Foster&nbsp;Father Fang Hua</p>
 <p>Were all Immortals so removed from the attractions of the mundane world?</p>
 <p>I carried this question inside me for three days until I wanted to pound my head with my own fists. It was too oppressing.</p>
 <p>Recently, the beautiful person always watched me eat before leaving. He would return to the residence after a long while, pleased, and then spend the entire afternoon reclining on a bamboo mat to doze.</p>
 <p>Fang Hua never arranged any work for me to do, and spoke to me very little. He seemed to have thoroughly forgotten a person like me existed. Even if I tried to increase my popularity by wandering back and forth before him, he never looked&nbsp;directly at me. Despite this ill-treatment, he always arranged for three meals a day and waited upon me. It was as if I wasn’t led here to be ordered about, but to enjoy a happy life filled with ease…</p>
 <p>Seriously, what a weird guy…</p>
 <p>--</p>
 <p>Midday.</p>
 <p>As usual, he cooked some dishes and placed them on the table. Without even touching the chopsticks, he immediately ignored me to grab his robes and head out the door. I quickly swallowed a few mouthfuls of rice, used my sleeve to wipe my mouth and bent forwards, holding my breath as I tailed along behind him.</p>
 <p>The house he built here was pretty out of the way. There weren’t even any neighbors around, and a field of medicinal herbs grew behind the building. The shade of the green trees was dense beneath the summer sun and beneath it, a pond of water rippled with jade-green waves that gave people an immeasurably cool feeling.</p>
 <p>A white-robed silhouette disappeared into the ancient forest.</p>
 <p>Huh…</p>
 <p>Weird, why did he slip into a place where the birds wouldn't even go to&nbsp;poop?&nbsp;Enduring the rays of the scorching sun, I broke into a run until I found and leaned against the back of an ancient tree. My neck craned around to look quietly.</p>
 <p><em>Huh...</em></p>
 <p>I saw the beautiful person rise to the sky with a leap, his image reflected in the pond below. The white robes were airy as his foot stepped lightly on the surface of the pool without stirring a ripple. Then, slender hands stretched forward to grab something I couldn't see as his body slowly floated to the ground, as lovely as an immortal's. Only now, there was the stem of a lotus flower in his hand.</p>
 <p>Ah...I didn't know he could set the mood so well. Using&nbsp;<em>qinggong</em>[1] on a hot day to approach the water's surface and gather lotuses was pretty yuppie. At that time I really wanted to express the surging within my heart.</p>
 <p>The beautiful person was like a painting, with long hair swirling in the air and flowers falling in riotous profusion. He flawlessly tore off the petals from the lotus flower…please take note, he <em>tore&nbsp;</em>them…and then stood up, placing them in his mouth as he began to chew.</p>
 <p>His expression then was as if he was trying a delicate, delicious flavor of the mortal world.</p>
 <p>I clung to the old tree, eyes wide as I watched this so-called immortal fly upwards. In the span of a second, he had gathered various flowers into his hands, settled into the tree, and stuffed them all into his mouth.</p>
 <p>After seeing him move like floating clouds and flowing water, I became as dumbstruck as a wooden chicken. His table manners were refined, his lips slightly part in a way that radiated appeal. Even if he had been eating the Five Grains[2] or similar, he'd still look dazzling. Whoever heard of someone who ignored normal food in favor of such non-human things…</p>
 <p>Wait, a proverb said:&nbsp;<em>many esteemed men of noble character do not follow normal conventions.</em>&nbsp;His high martial prowess definitely had something to do with his diet. Perhaps those flowers could improve the potency of one’s inner energy?</p>
 <p>Yes, that must be it.</p>
 <p>My face filled with greed as I ran below his tree to squat on my heels,&nbsp;head raised. The only thing I was missing was a wagging tail. He lowered his head to look at me without a word, but the message in his eyes was obvious:&nbsp;<em>why did you come here?</em></p>
 <p>I feigned ignorance. He tilted his head to one side, still chewing. I stared fixedly, eagerly looking at him with adoring eyes.</p>
 <p>“…you want to eat some?” He finally opened his mouth.</p>
 <p>My eyes shone and I couldn’t nod fast enough. He really was generous, because my palms had just reached out before he gave me an entire bunch of flowers. I bent my head to sniff them.</p>
 <p><em>Sweet...</em></p>
 <p>But I couldn’t smell anything particularly extraordinary.</p>
 <p>Earlier in the year when there was no food, I was even willing to eat tree bark. Yet I'd never ate flowers, because I couldn’t tell between poisonous and non-poisonous types. Not to mention it felt unpleasant on the tongue.</p>
 <p><em>This…</em></p>
 <p>Perhaps it was different.</p>
 <p>I copied Fang Hua, savoring the flavors of the pieces in my mouth before chewing fiercely. In a flash, I was struck speechless by the incomparably bitter taste. It was extremely distasteful, both harsh and astringent. The only other thing was a fragrant aroma that spread across my tongue.</p>
 <p>These were just regular flowers, wasn’t he just making himself suffer?&nbsp;<em>Phooey…</em>the entire root of my tongue turned numb…</p>
 <p>His eyes curved.</p>
 <p><em>Bully.</em></p>
 <p>“Does it taste good?”</p>
 <p>“Your mom! From the start, this wasn't fit for human consumption!"</p>
 <p>“Correct.” He gently propped up his head with a hand, half-reclining on the tree, the position giving off a feeling of high command as he looked at me. His almond-shaped phoenix eyes, accented by a mark shaped like a single tear, had a certain indescribable charm. “This isn't fit for human consumption."</p>
 <p>Then,&nbsp;since he ate it…</p>
 <p>Wasn't he mocking himself? Yet he seemed to be expounding on a truth.</p>
 <p>In any case, it was hard to say. He looked respectable, and there were no emotions on his face. After looking at me for a while, he suddenly jumped off the tree, scattering crabapple cores all over the ground.</p>
 <p>His expression was cold.</p>
 <p><em>Ah…</em></p>
 <p>Esteemed senior, you’re not mad, right? My guaranteed financial support for the rest of my life, my white rice , will I watch as they all leave me like a bird…? If I had offended him, I’d probably need to return to that place where life was worse than death, and suffer the same days of unbearable hunger.</p>
 <p>They say being too gutsy only got you bad ends.</p>
 <p>Pulling up my robes, I anxiously hurried after him and caught him in an embrace from the back. He was very soft and warm, as well as fragrant… This feeling was like the one I remembered every night, calling to mind many different shades of the past.&nbsp;I cried out a word then that would make us tremble with laughter in the future.</p>
 <p>“Mother…”</p>
 <p>His body shook, as if frightened by me, and he tried to pry me loose.</p>
 <p>I stood dumbfounded, knowing that I was in trouble.</p>
 <p>Aye, how shameful. I hugged him tighter.</p>
 <p>He seemed flustered, at a loss but unable to cast me aside. Afterward, he could only pat me gently to calm my sobbing before pulling me away. He knelt&nbsp;before me with a helpless gaze in his eyes, both indignant and distressed. “Listen, you can treat this as a home, but I’m not your mother…and also…” His low voice seemed to be mixed with a great effort to conceal something. “And also I’m a male, different from you humans. I am a Beast[3] and<em>&nbsp;</em>you can call me Fang Hua, but don’t call me mother."</p>
 <p>I blinked a few times, raising my head to look at him, and saw that the space between his eyebrows was weighed down with sorrow.</p>
 <p>Sadly, I understood too little back then.</p>
 <p>Many years later I came to regret, because in that moment I called him:</p>
 <p><em>“Yifu[4].”</em></p>
