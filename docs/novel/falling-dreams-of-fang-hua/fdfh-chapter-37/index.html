 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>While I was lost in thought, Second had already opened the windows. The sunlight was dazzling and there was a refreshing breeze. I drew in a breath, rinsing my mouth out and washing my face before holding onto his shoulder for a lazy stretch. Then I opened the doors and prepared to go out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wear another layer," Second hurriedly grabbed one of the bedcovers and tried to force it over my shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No need, it's not cold today," I refused with my hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He furrowed his brows without a word to stare at me, eyes slipping down to my chest. I followed his gaze to make my own observations. What was he looking at? My development there was perfectly normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Master shouldn't be wearing men's clothes at all," so saying, he unfolded a set of robes and shook them out three times. He used it to cover me from the back and added, "If outsiders see, it'd be bad."</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even a few extra layers wouldn't hide the truth of my female gender. Not to mention, everyone in this house was one of my people...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then I laughed in spite of myself, he sure knew how to learn from others. My finger casually rested beneath his chin and gave it a scratch. "Oh, Second, if you keep worrying over things like this, you're going to turn into my son."</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face turned completely red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Draping my robes loosely over myself, I carelessly kicked open the door. As it turned out, I was greeted by chaos[1].</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did you call this...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being bad at being good, but good at being bad?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Second had really made a good guess. Standing in the yard, I lifted my eyes to see a yellow-robed youth standing gracefully at a high point, raising his head to curse loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's not like I'll kill you, so what are you running away for?" As he said this, he rolled up his sleeves and spat. "I refuse to believe that I can't poison you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>I heaved a sigh and accepted the cup of tea from Second, sipping in silence as I watched passively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no need to say it. The little Poison Prince had clashed with the others in the house again. Even after staying by my side all these years, his explosive temper hadn't changed. Hence, now he was swearing as he ran haphazardly through the rooms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the person evading him was very fast. It was hard to see his steps as he leapt on roofs and vaulted over walls, weaving in and out of the bamboo forest as pale pink blur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though Sixth's body was weak, exercising over the years had made his lightness technique better and better. I was full of interest as I tagged along to look, my long robe draped across my shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sound floated up from the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I quickly backtracked and looked down, flushed with shame. There was already a man paralyzed on the ground, his scar-covered face turning green with anger. It looked like he'd been poisoned and was now unable to move.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yikes...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Did I step on him by accident?</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was alarmed, but after seeing who it was, I grew used to it. I inspected my surroundings before using my foot to nudge his clothes. "You're the only straightforward and honest one, you get tricked every time. That can't be easy." Finally, I squatted down, head bowed in submission as I thumped his knee. "Fifth...my poor Fifth, it's fine if you were born ugly, but I just treated you a bit last night and now you've been poisoned on your face again."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Master, you're blocking me," Second clicked his tongue a few times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh," I stopped to wipe my face, reluctantly moving aside a few steps. There was a stone table nearby, with two people seated on low stools. Intrigued, I went over. "What are you guys playing?"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>"</span></i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style>Xiangqi</span></i></a><i><span style>," </span></i><span style>answered a rhythmic, sonorous voice. "We were just waiting for Second to finish serving you...so he could come...help treat Fifth's poison."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah, Master woke up really early today. Wait...it's my turn, stop." a delicate and pretty young lord held his chess piece in the air, muttering indecisively. He couldn't seem to make up his mind, but the brown mole by his eye made him especially good-looking. I quietly moved over and took a glance, before pointing at a certain spot, my head turned towards the skies in a careless fashion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He blinked, and it seemed as if the fog had cleared from his eyes. Glancing at me, he hesitated again before slowly lowering his piece. "I'll move from here to here."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"General!" A crystal-clear voice spat out the words. That handsome and spirited man sat in an extremely dignified fashion, smiling gently as he set down a piece without a hint of anger. "This time you lost two pieces of fine silver. Your total is nine losses, which converts with interest into 120 taels."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ah...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When playing with such high stakes, be careful that you're not ruined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His mouth stiffened as he collected the money, before turning to speak. "Ah, Little Fifth was poisoned with the </span><i><span style>Seven Scattering Emotions</span></i><span style>, so he can't be touched...but you..." he looked over at Second, who was currently taking Fifth's pulse, and paused. "Never mind, you've already touched him. Well, it's not like you fear poisons anyways. But poor Fifth will have to endure six more hours of pain now."</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Good grief...did you purposely wait before bringing that up?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He probably saw me spending all that time in Fifth's room last night and wanted to punish him. As expected, the more beautiful a person was, the more sinister was their heart. I'm afraid no one else in the world could be beautiful and harmless like&nbsp;</span><i><span style>that </span></i><span style>person...</span></p>
 <p><span style>My thoughts strayed, and I felt a dull ache in my heart. My hands tightened as I focused on circulating my </span><i><span style>Qi </span></i><span style>to compose myself...</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a </span><i><span style>hwaaaaa! </span></i><span style>Astonished, I looked to see someone wave their sleeves, the fabric floating whimsically. The chess pieces scattered off the board and tumbled to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No more, I'm not playing, I've lost all my pay for the month," the delicate, pretty young lord with the mole waved his sleeves, digging inside before holding open the fabric for me to see. Exactly as he said...it was completely empty. He probably noticed I was acting strange and got the idea to distract me. With a smile, he spoke. "It was all Master's fault that I carelessly spent my silver. How many face masks will I have to sell to recover the differences in costs?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>My heart turned warm as I interrupted, "Fourth, didn't you say last time that one face mask can sell for lots of money?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Those are human skin face masks..." he cast a sidelong glance at me. "Now that I'm with you, how could I dare tear off human skins? You can't get much from selling pig skin face masks."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Limpid pupils turned to peer at me again before he leaned with a whisper. "Since I'm broke, I'll eat and drink off you, all right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sure!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>His smile caused the tiny brown mole at the edge of his eyes to raise up. He was exceptionally handsome when he looked at me, making me happy enough to want to hug him in my arms. Unfortunately, it was hard to make a move with everyone else watching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He struck while the iron was hot and scooted closer, adding in another line. "My bedcovers are a little thin. Originally I wanted to buy new ones with my winnings, but since you lost everything for me, you wouldn't mind if we share your bed tonight, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don't mind..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, someone kicked my butt from behind, leaving me with a burning pain. My mind blanked out before I regained my bearings.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wait a sec...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>What did he say? Share a bed with me?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>My butt still hurt; it seemed like whoever kicked me went all out. I rubbed it a few times without betraying my feelings, and glanced sideways at the little Prince Mole. "It's only the ninth month, so how could the nights be chilly? Fourth, this is where you're wrong. I feed you and raised you and save your life...but you're still fixated on getting closer in vain hopes of sullying your Master's purity."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wore a shameless smile and stopped talking, though his eyes had the hidden bitterness of someone thwarted in love. Silently, he moved to sit on one side, though he couldn't resist raising a leg to kick me. Looks like little Prince Mole felt extremely depressed and wronged...</span></p>
 <p><span style>I had the sudden insight that something wasn't quite right, and uncertainly narrowed my eyes at the chess pieces. "You're so familiar with those obscure arts of the Five Elements. Something as simple as a board game shouldn't thwart you, and you even had me lose for you. Were you doing it on purpose..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was indignant. "Whatever, I don't care. Either you come to my room, or I go to yours." I was dumbfounded, but before I could reply, someone else retorted with a shout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Exactly how do you think you're speaking to Master?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the voice faded, its owner had raised his eyebrows at me. I hastily took the hint and lowered my head to reverently pour him a cup of tea. I then realized that wasn't right either, but by the time I looked up, he was already lifting the cup to drink.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was this called...?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Servility.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I was born to serve others no matter how grand I looked, or how impressive my reputation was, or how I ridiculed my seven talented, unrivaled young princes. Who didn't know the suffering and distress behind my impressive image, oh my bitter life...ah, I didn't even get to say it...as a carefree idler of the </span><i><span style>jianghu, </span></i><span style>I was just an idle person they could boss around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though I'd saved some of their lives and grew familiar&nbsp;with the rest, I only discovered after returning home that it was easy to invite guests, but hard to send them off...all of them started dawdling around. Especially this guy, the oldest. Though he wasn't the earliest one to enter these doors, he insisted on being called First.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, I thought he had some status in the martial arts circles, at least enough to become their leader. If I hadn't cured his poison in the past, he might not have let me off so easily. I thought saving him was just as simple as that... As it turned out, he had a good heart, and followed me with his sword for a hundred and eight thousand </span><i><span style>li[2] </span></i><span style>to repay his debt of gratitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in order to conceal his identity the past few years, his martial arts skills became less and less outstanding. Fortunately, the so-called Prince Mole, Little Fourth, did a divination and suggested he go into business. Nobody foresaw that the silver would come pouring in afterwards. Nowadays, he paid off all expenses in the house. In short, he came to repay me but ended up getting paid instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although we had lots of people in this house, our lives were pretty satisfactory. I didn't speak of statutes so we lived rather casually. They all said I couldn't tell good from bad...</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did they mean by </span><i><span style>'good and bad'?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I really had no idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you thinking about?" a certain person behind me raised his foot again and gave me a ruthless kick, though it was lighter than before. "Everyone's been waiting for you to wake up...it's time to eat."</span></p>
 <p><span style>I made a noise of agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He brushed my shoulders as he walked past, the clothes swinging with a steady rhythm. This guy really was worthy of being called First with an imposing manner like that. I couldn't imitate that air even if I cultivated for 800 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>My mouth opened and closed as I scuttled after him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a round table with seven seats. After everyone sat down, two were still empty, so I counted </span><i><span style>First, Second, Fourth, Fifth...</span></i><span style>yikes, Little Fifth's complexion still looked terrible, he must have been heavily poisoned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dishes arrived, nine plates of delicate meats and vegetables all properly arranged, as well as a big bowl of soup with spots of oil floating on the surface[3]. I stretched my neck to look outside, feeling so hungry...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Were they going to eat or not?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"TIME TO EAT!" I raised my internal energy and roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bamboo leaves shuddered in the absence of wind, revealing the pale pink silhouette intermittently weaving back and forth through the air. He was agile and quick, holding onto a bamboo branch as he looked at us from far away with a wretched expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Come down, come down. Get down here if you have any guts," a figure dressed in yellow robes stuck his hands on his waist, stomping his feet. He had a crafty gaze in his eyes as he looked up, poisonous powders in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like an affectionate lover.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I almost couldn't bear disturbing their time together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eat," the oldest ordered angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe his voice hadn't been loud enough, but he had always been a man of action. Slowly, he raised the chopsticks in his hands and </span><span style>snapped</span><i> </i><span style>them without so much as a blink. Then he waved his sleeves in a </span><i><span style>whoosh </span></i><span style>of wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those two broken chopstick halves were ruthlessly quick and accurate. They shot powerfully through the bamboo grove and into the wetlands beyond, missing the two people there by millimeters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No wonder he was a martial arts expert...</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was nothing ambiguous about his actions at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the twinkling of an eye, a wind surged in from outdoors and rattled the table. Very shortly, all seven chairs of the table were filled, and everyone started pouring wine and picking vegetables as if nothing had happened at all. No one minded&nbsp;while I held the heaving form of the pink-robed youth in my arms, his flushed face even brighter than the peach blossoms. Distressed, I fussily used my sleeve to wipe the sweat from his brow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Come, eat a piece of rabbit, it'll strengthen your legs," I encouraged him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without fail, he obediently picked up his chopsticks and gave a piece to the little Poison Prince.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All right...now the Poison Prince was angry enough to have fire flaming from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I've got to say...if he can't catch up to you, then that's that. To actually use these chopsticks to mock him wasn't just being heartless and unfair, it was dragging me into danger&nbsp;as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I lowered my head to blow on the soup, cooling it. Then I drank it with gusto, not daring to stray my vision a bit.&nbsp;</span><span style>Suddenly, little Fourth Prince Mole raised his head, as if listening in rapt attention. His words came out of the blue. "Master, someone's come to visit."</span></p>
 <p><span style>I spat out a mouthful of soup, hastily wiping my mouth with my sleeves. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Curses, </span></i><span style>who came to call during mealtimes? This was obviously someone who wanted a free meal. I quickly stood up to look, though I couldn't see anything: only a small, thin sound reached my ears, like wind or something else altogether. Immediately, the sound grew louder, creating a noisy ruckus in the bamboo woods beyond. The green leaves rustled against each other, accompanied by the faint sound of bells and flutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I took the time to collect myself. Someone had broken through the spell formation Little Fourth set outside our borders and entered our territory.</span></p>
