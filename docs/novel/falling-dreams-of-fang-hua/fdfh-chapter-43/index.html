 <p>Chapter 43&nbsp;<span style="color: #eceff4">Original and most updated translations are from volaretranslations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A rustling noise of something like silk reached my ears, making me feel unbearably itchy. It sounded like some people were purposely speaking in whispers in a great hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where is the emperor?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He went to court."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>"Amitabha[1], </span></i><span style>he's been absent for three days, and now he's finally going. That's right...has the person inside awakened yet? Can I take a look? I heard this Master has an impressive background. The emperor's been by her side since the first day she arrived."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Speak softer."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why should I, isn't she dead asleep? Even the imperial physician said it's not likely she'll wake up again." The voice drew closer and closer as it spoke. There was the sound of someone lifting a sleeve and drawing aside what sounded like cloth. Though my eyes were closed, I could still feel my surroundings grow brighter, and a soft breeze blow in...the air grew fresh and unhindered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt like coming back from the dead...though my hands felt weak as ever.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where was I...?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"I told you not to move the curtain, she's very delicate and fragile...don't give her a chill. There were a lot of imperial physicians executed recently. If you act without any propriety, be careful it's not our heads that roll next time."</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a pained cry as someone dragged the figure away by his ear while he pleaded for mercy. Abruptly, the light dimmed into the dreary atmosphere of the dead.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No, I don't want this...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Don't...don't take away my light. My heart wailed mournfully as my hand reached towards the silk curtains, twisting them aside as I straightened up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I opened my eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Subconsciously, I craned my head and felt at the offensive material of the curtain. A ray of light pierced through to shine on my fingers, lifeless and pallid to an offensive point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It suddenly became quiet outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those two people seemed thoroughly frightened, trembling as they watched me shaking to open the bed curtains. After being used to the dark for so long, this sudden light was unbearable and I squinted for quite a while, my mind buzzing until I recovered. I gave them a gentle smile. The two exchanged glances with ashen faces before prostrating themselves on the ground. With their identical ash blue robes and </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%E9%A9%AC%E8%B9%84%E8%A2%96&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1848&amp;bih=1060&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7osHD2PbNAhXMXh4KHTZbCDAQ_AUIBigB#imgrc=_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>horse-hoof sleeves</span></a><span style>, they were probably young eunuchs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We've disturbed Master's peace and quiet, please punish us, Master." the steadier of the two eunuchs spoke as he knocked their head repeatedly against the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just hearing this sound was insufferable. Did he think his head was cast from copper? I clicked my tongue, looking away when I saw a hint of red. What peace and quiet? </span><i><span style>Pah, </span></i><span style>I'm not dead yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You're making my eyes hurt moving up and down like that, so get up." I waved my hand and tried to rise, but felt strange when my hands touched the bedding. The material was exquisite, thick and soft. It was embroidered with beautiful clouds and dragons, but I didn't recall it being so tasteful. In my house...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huh? How come I couldn't remember a thing?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I blinked a few times, staring at the equally curious pair of eunuchs, and asked them, "Where am I?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"To reply Master, this is his majesty's sleeping chambers."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oh...</span></p>
 <p><span style>His majesty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The emperor's sleeping chambers, then.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>My breath caught, and I wanted to get off the bed that instant, but my body was simply too weak. I paused to rest for a while before setting my toes on the floor, but it felt like I was standing on cotton. Before I could steady myself on my feet, my body swayed, and someone came to support me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Master, if you want anything, just tell us. Please don't get off the bed yourself," the cleverer of the two eunuchs spoke as he examined my complexion, gently pulling me back as he waved a hand behind him. "What are you dawdling for, go call his majesty and tell him Master's awakened."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Call his majesty? Don't...</span></p>
 <p><span style>I...I-I'm afraid...afraid of strangers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How did I end up on the imperial dragon bed? What happened here, and why couldn't I remember anything? I furiously slapped my head, scaring the person next to me. He wanted to stop me, yet didn't dare, hands hovering beneath mine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he waiting to catch something, or what?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn't be that he was waiting to collect the hairs that fell off my head after I beat myself up?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Weirdo...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Master, are you feeling unwell anywhere?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>A little...let me think.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I raised my head as someone inserted a soft cushion behind my back to make me comfortable. My body shifted a few times before I spoke, "I have no energy in my body, find myself short of breath when speaking, and my stomach's burning with pain. Oh...hey, uh, Little Second, take my pulse for me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"To reply Master, your servant's name isn't Little Second," he bowed in extreme respect, reaching out with his hands to tuck me in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was at a loss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is that so...I just blurted out whatever was on my mind, my memory's not so clear."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Master, you're probably confused because you're hungry. You've been unconscious for three days, but we've only dared to give you some soup. Please close your eyes and rest for a while, I'll instruct the imperial kitchen to prepare some food right away." Still bowing, he carefully backed away and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days?!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Curses, </span></i><span style>no wonder I was so hungry. I was even experiencing double vision, so I thought I had bad eyesight... I gave a ridiculing laugh and closed my eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soft footsteps pattered towards me, so light I wouldn't have heard them if I wasn't paying attention. I lifted my eyes to see a small wooden serving table set on the bed, followed by various fragrant, delicious dishes. There was someone standing against the light in the doorframe, quietly watching the young eunuchs entering in single file.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The delicious aroma enticed me to crack my eyes open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Come, Master. Please try this warm porridge first." the same eunuch from before spoke, and I </span><i><span style>hnn'd </span></i><span style>in agreement. My energy was just about gone, and it felt extremely comfortable to lean against a soft cushion, half-awake as I opened my mouth and waited to be fed...</span></p>
 <p><span style>But a long time passed without me getting any food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I frowned, and just when I was about to open my eyes, I felt a space on the bed next to me sink down. Someone drew near me, and a smooth, warm object brushed against my lips while the person blew against its surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I sipped a tiny mouthful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The porridge was thick and glutinous, carrying with it a faint fragrance. The level of saltiness was just right, and it was easy to swallow once I had it in my mouth. The taste lingered by my teeth for a long time afterward. I wanted to eat more, but that person didn't move, mystifying me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I lazily opened my eyes and saw that the person holding the bowl and spoon before me wasn't a eunuch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did I know?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clearly had a Adam's apple and traces of stubble by his chin, though it was a bit wan. Firm eyebrows framed a pair of tender eyes, making him hard to describe...at any rate, he was an outstandingly handsome man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He fed me another spoonful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn't swallow, but couldn't help but dodge to one side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his eyebrows, and the eunuchs around his prostrated their shaking bodies to the floor in dreadful fear. The man's lips turned up, his smile warm and intimate as he softly urged, "Drink it, it'll bolster your body."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tone was light but carried an unmistakable force. Very few people could turn a simple suggestion into something that sounded like a threat, but he was one of them. I was a little dazed. My eyes fixed on him and his hand, still holding the spoon. The color of his sleeves was a bold yellow, embroidered with flying dragons in gold thread.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I blinked, moving my gaze downwards before I realized he was dressed in yellow from head to toe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was lying on the dragon bed, being personally fed porridge by the emperor?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>T-t-this...what was going on?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What's wrong? This expression...you look like I'm feeding you arsenic." his face turned wooden and his eyebrows arched, though there was still laughter in his eyes. "It's going to turn cold, you should drink it up before it does."</span></p>
 <p><span style>I braced myself and took the bowl from his hands, hesitating slightly before draining the contents in one gulp. The man seemed as if he'd seen something unexpected, looking at me as if floored. He turned his head aside and muttered to himself, "What's the matter, she really drank what I gave her..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did I do something wrong?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the emperor. Even if he gave me arsenic, I'd have no choice but to drink it, right? I used my sleeve to wipe my mouth and stole a glance at him. His smile seemed full of meaning as he looked at me in silence, turning my entire body cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I lowered my eyes and crawled out from the covers until I was kneeling on the bed. After that bout of illness, my movements were still natural and spontaneous, clean and complete. "Your Majesty, I can't remember anything, nor do I know how I ended up lying here...anyways, if it's taking responsibility or rebuking, come at me outright. You don't need this policy of comforting me first and punishing me later, I don't even know what I did."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why would I be lying on this bed? What kind of status did I have? I couldn't remember anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shao'er, what's happened to you?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pair of hands rested on my shoulders, shifting me slightly. The fabric draped around me like a cocoon, similar to the feeling I'd gotten from my dreams these past days. I could remember these large palms stroking my forehead and my face, over and over again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice was a little hoarse as he spoke. "Why does it seem like you've become a completely different person after waking up?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked at him in astonishment. It seemed like...this person had no intentions to hurt me. Could it be that I misunderstood? He propped himself against the bed to lean over and study me with unblinking eyes that hid a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You don't remember what you came to the palace for?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was ignorant. So I hadn't always been part of the imperial court?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Think a bit, besides me...was there anyone else you wanted to see?" his voice was calm and filled with warmth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked at him, sensing that he was truly trying to guide me along. Within the court, women dreamed of seeing the emperor everyday. Could there be anyone else? Was it possible that this person discovered me in an affair and wanted to surprise me with his knowledge? But that's not right. If I had been discovered, could I still sit so harmlessly on the dragon bed and get personal treatment from the emperor?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What a tangled mess...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you can't remember, there's no need to waste your efforts," A pair of hands brushed my forehead, smoothing it out. His mood seemed to have lightened as he raised his voice. "Someone call the imperial physician."</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some old guy turned up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I'd never seen him before, but I hadn't crossed paths with many people. As to the people and furnishings in this great hall, I had no impressions of them in my memories. Numbly, I watched as he examined my pulse, pinching the area as he kept muttering to himself. Then he reverently prostrated himself on the ground and said a whole bunch of stuff, but it was more or less that my vital energy passageways were obstructed, and there was </span><i><span style>qi </span></i><span style>in my heart; my body was feeble, I lacked adequate </span><i><span style>qi </span></i><span style>and blood...finally he cast an uncertain glance at me and added that all of these had temporarily caused my amnesia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I think this guy was just spouting off a load of bull.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was complete nonsense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though I had no proof...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The emperor's eyes had never left my face, as if trying to find clues in my expression. I straightened my clothes and sat properly before staring back, but he broke the gaze to ask the imperial physician, "When will she be cured?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The body can be nursed to health, but...there's no telling when her memory will recover. Your servant cannot help your majesty resolve this difficulty and deserves to die." The white-haired old man knocked his head against the floor, body shivering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the emperor was in excellent spirits as he waved his hand. "Someone, take him to fill out the prescription. Reward him with two hundred taels of gold."</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was shocked speechless. He was so liberal with his money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn't take long before someone carried in a bowl of liquid medicine. I gave a sniff and sneered. This was a harmless prescription that couldn't hurt the body. Its ingredients were all precious, expensive medicines that would neither alleviate my illnesses nor cure me completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huh, how did one whiff send a whole list of ingredient names tumbling into my head...? I crinkled my brows and stared at the bowl of black-colored soup. I was very familiar with its makeup...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is it, is there anything wrong?" On the side, the emperor drew closer, sitting personally by the edge of the bed with a hand on my leg. I felt a bit repulsed, but...since I was lying on his bed, I let it pass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Definitely wrong," I nodded, looking straight at him. "From the time since I've woke, it's been nothing but soups and liquids. I'm...hungry."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gave a sudden laugh at my unexpected answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The dishes are all on the table, it's not as if you're not allowed to eat. Unless...you still want me to feed you?"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Che, </span></i><span style>this person, the Son of Heaven, was so imposing. Even with him just sitting there, I didn't dare to eat first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"And I thought your personality changed. Your old habit of criticizing others is still the same." The emperor's voice carried an unmistakable cheer and warmth as he picked up a pair of jade chopsticks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A court lady on the side immediately stepped forward with a curtesy. "Your servant shall serve you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He handed the chopsticks over and pointed at various dishes: ‘</span><i><span style>Oh, bring her some fish in bamboo shoots, also some slow-cooked chicken with lily bulbs...right, that section of leg there is her favorite.‘</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I was completely tongue-tied. Looking at the tasty dishes that were brought before my lips, I had to swallow my drool. The emperor gave me a "kindly"[2] look with raised eyebrows, as if to tell me he'd feed me personally if I didn't eat. The jade chopsticks came through to offer me a piece of chicken wrapped around a white bamboo shoot glistening with oil. It looked delicious. I obediently took a bite and chewed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was so good that my eyes squeezed shut...I felt like I could even eat my tongue. Not a bit greasy, but tasty and refreshing. The flavor levels were just right. How long had it been since I tasted something like this...?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, the other dishes served my way all turned out to be things I liked to eat. With my appetite whetted, I actually ate two bowls of rice. The emperor seemed to be hungry too, and drank a bowl of porridge to accompany me. It was very odd. He was so familiar with my likes and favorites. I blew on a hot cup of tea in my hands and carefully took a sip. How invigorating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your Majesty..." I lifted my eyes to look at him. "I heard I've just entered the palace recently. Exactly what kind of person am I?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemed a bit blank, and looked at me with a strange expression. Before his gaze, I replaced the teacup back on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What a joke. If I didn't ask, wouldn't I be an idiot? I'd slept enough and ate enough, it was time for proper matters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He propped himself up against the bed and scooted over, voice exceptionally mild. "You're already on </span><i><span style>Zhen's </span></i><span style>bed, who else could you be?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A woman," I replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes," he raised his eyes and gave me a meaningful smile, taking the chance to tuck me in as he spoke slowly. "It's a long story, but suffice to say, you're </span><i><span style>Zhen's </span></i><span style>empress."</span></p>
 <p><span style>I did a spit-take.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was my turn to be agape. I stared blankly at him, but he just lowered his head to grasp my hand, a small smile playing about his lips. The imposing aura of an emperor had disappeared to be replaced with an easy, intimate air. It was difficult to meet his gaze, which gave me an indescribable feeling...I hastily averted my eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the dragon bed. I frowned slightly...</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was absolutely true that I woke up on here. Even if I was a mere concubine in the imperial harem, this was an exceptional favor. Inwardly, I puzzled things out as I lowered my head to touch the silks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But I was his woman?</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face didn't seemed to be lying, and his tone was fair and reasonable. Still, it felt...this wasn't the case, though I couldn't figure out which part was off. His intimacy felt a little foreign to me. Hey, I say...where's he touching with those hands? I carefully withdrew my leg and hid it securely beneath the covers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the huge room, the flames were dazzling. At some point in time, the servants had all disappeared, leaving just the two of us. The atmosphere was a bit strange. His eyes were very bright. I could tell from his expression that he wasn't angry at my sudden show of disrespect, but gave him an uncertain glance. Though we hadn't interacted much, I was pretty certain he wouldn't try to trick me. Moreover, he couldn't even bear to hurt me while I was severely ill...that thought made me release a breath and feel more relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I curled up within the boundaries of my bedding. Even though I'd just woken up, I still felt sleepy. Eating a full meal really...made it hard to keep my eyes open. I propped up my body and reclined against the headboard, thoughts tangled as I spoke. "Why did I suddenly get so ill? Has my body always been so weak?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gave me a stiff look, hands stroking my hair as if he held tender feelings that were difficult to express. There was a distressed look in his eyes as he heaved a sigh and drew me into his arms, speaking in a low voice. "This was all </span><i><span style>Zhen's </span></i><span style>fault. Those people...</span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>won't forgive them."</span></p>
 <p><span style>His gaze was as calm as ice, seven parts fierce and three parts sharp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>My eyebrows pressed together as I huddled into that warmth. My body that had been braced taut like a spring eventually learned to relax. It looked like things weren't all that peaceful in the court, there were still premeditated murder plots floating about. If the victim was a favorite concubine, then there were probably no shortage of threats.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Curses...</span></i><span style>so much for freedom and leisure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I tightened my grip minutely on his cuffs and asked, "As your majesty's woman, which level of the imperial harem would </span><i><span style>chenqie[3] </span></i><span style>belong to?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>I couldn't stay on the dragon bed for the rest of my life, right? Once I'd rested enough, I'd have to return to wherever I came from so the other women wouldn't resent me. Otherwise, as an imperial concubine, I'd have to spend the night engaging in the merry, amorous passions of a man and woman. Even if I shrank in a corner to study pornography books, that wouldn't be an excuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemed surprised. "Giving you status is easy enough. How about </span><i><span style>guifei, </span></i><span style>the highest ranking imperial concubine?" The emperor held my hand, stroking it a few times as he leaned back and said, "Bestowing the title is a little troublesome since the imperial palace relies on different sources of power for influence. But it's not impossible."</span></p>
 <p><span style>What...</span></p>
 <p><span style>This guy, were all emperors so easygoing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that couldn't be right. My head felt a bit dizzy, and I muddled around in the dark until I felt a strand of thought leading me to a door...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Let me think a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"</span><i><span style>Qieshen </span></i><span style>has been lying on the emperor's bed for two or three days and am your majesty's empress. But I didn't have any official status until now?" I lifted my eyes, muttering indecisively as I felt the robes beneath my hands. The material was satiny soft, the Son of Heaven really wore things 1,000 times, 10,000 times better than ordinary people. I raised my head to look at him, my smile somewhat chilly. "Just entering the palace for a few days and getting ill can earn a place as the emperor's highest rank imperial concubine?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was that his meaning?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Our eyes met, and his mouth seemed to tremble, though the rest of his face didn't move. His eyes gleamed as he looked at me with a smile that wasn't a smile, asking lightly, "Who told you these things?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>My eyes drifted into the distance until they settled on somewhere outside the rooms, where the the two little eunuchs were kneeling on the ground. His electric gaze swept over, filled with the overwhelming aura of an emperor. Even at this distance, it felt like I could hear those servants tremble, their teeth chattering as they prostrated on the ground, too fearful to even ask for mercy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gave a snort, and I felt a bit uneasy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how easygoing, this man was still the emperor. How could I show off so much and go against him? I tried to move the bedcovers aside, but was stopped by his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Silly." The emperor didn't avoid my gaze, but looked at me directly, calm and composed. His eyes were like a serene pond.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gaze made me feel a bit timid. Had I thought wrongly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those two had clearly said that the emperor hadn't gone to court for three days, and that he'd been by my side since the first day I arrived at the palace. So where had I been before that? If I'd just entered the palace, why would the emperor know so much about my habits and favorite things?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sucked in a breath. "You only know how to go off into flights of fancy everyday." Though his voice slowed, he really did start explaining things to me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...we met while I was still a crown prince in exile among the common people. After ascending the throne, I looked for you for a very long time." He held me as he stroked my hair with soft touches. "That's why we're a couple."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He'd stopped referring to himself as </span><i><span style>Zhen, </span></i><span style>and reverted back to the commonplace </span><i><span style>"I". </span></i><span style>It made me feel...perplexed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But his embrace really was very nice and warm. I could smell the faint scent of bamboo, one of my favorites, and that beating heart--was it for me? It was pounding so quickly, the vibrations feeling like they'd pass through my own skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shao'er, you actually ended up forgetting everything."</span></p>
 <p><span style>My body relaxed as he held me, mouth smoothing into an expression of comfort. His head lowered to look at me, those clear, penetrating eyes like rays of moonlight. It was very peaceful around us.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a few court ladies entered in single file, holding something in their hands. Surprised, I straightened up, but he pressed me back down with a smile to lean in and speak. "You've slept for so long, you must be tired. I had someone prepare your favorite bath of medicinal herbs."</span></p>
 <p><span style>And then?</span></p>
 <p><span style>I squinted at him. His bearing was exceptionally fine, smiling as he pointed at an area behind a folding screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What kind of joke is this? Take a bath?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Here?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Curses, </span></i><span style>a girl like me wasn't going to sell her body and act like some lady from an entertainment house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Master, your servants will wait upon you," Two or three court ladies came to take my hands and help me over. A soft laugh came from behind me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Take good care of her for </span><i><span style>Zhen, </span></i><span style>or else I'll put you all on the spot."</span></p>
