 <p>Chapter 4</p>
 <p>According to the calculations done via the Venus shared system’s data, the young robot girl should be cultivating the tenth “Sun” today. The three robots gave up on trying to create new items and closely observed the effects on the young robot girl from the images sent back by the shared system.</p>
 <p>According to their predictions, either the energy needed for the “Suns” to bloom this time would cause the young robot girl’s self-circulation system to collapse, or the remaining energy would not be enough to support the young robot girl’s actions in the future, causing her to remain in a dormant status to oversee the “Suns”.</p>
 <p>However, the collapse came sooner than the system’s prediction.</p>
 <p>Before the tenth “Sun” started to bloom, the self-circulation system of the young robot girl utterly collapsed.</p>
 <p>It no longer generated any energy, and large amounts of energy were even being lost. The tenth “Sun” that was prepared to bloom quickly started to wilt after losing its energy source, while the ninth “Sun”, that had already bloomed, also began to show signs of wilting. As the energy scattered, the young robot young girl reached out her robotic arms to hug these “Suns”. Data from the sensors showed that she was transferring all the energy being provided to herself to these “Suns”.</p>
 <p>After finishing a series of calculations, the Venus shared system showed that the young robot girl would need a bit of external energy for the self-circulation system to resume normal operations. The energy level needed was very little, equal to 2% of the Venus robot’s total energy level. It was something that any of the robots would be able to provide for her. However, the issue was that the possibility of the Venus robots leaving their current planet to travel to Sector z-b23 was 0%.</p>
 <p>The shared system produced a prohibition order due to the danger.</p>
 <p>However, No.2 still sent out a series of commands to resume the calculations. The result was still a 0% success rate and prohibition of execution.</p>
 <p><strong>“Go save her.”</strong></p>
 <p>Although this message was naturally incapable of being transferred through the shared system due to the calculation results, No.2 and No.3 received this message from the mechanical sounds produced by No.1. This was the first time that the Venus robots had succeeded in communicating using something outside of electronic signals through their shared system.</p>
 <p>No.2 moved its head compartment up and down. No.1’s library program immediately recognized it as the “nod” that humans used to express agreement. No.1 then immediately left the shared system. For the Venus robots, leaving the shared system meant abandoning their self-circulation. The only thing that could support their activities was the little bit of energy within each robot.</p>
 <p>The three robots all left the shared system despite the continuous warning signals from the system. Using the library program, No.1 made new calculations while ignoring the mission and priorities. The results showed one method that could barely reach the standards of saving the girl robot. The total sum of the energy storage on all three robots were just enough to allow one robot to arrive at z-b23 with the bare minimum of energy required. Without the shared system, the communication amount between the three robots was restricted to the lowest degree, so No.1 did not “tell” the results of the calculations or the plan to the other two robots.</p>
 <p>It couldn’t, nor did it have enough time.</p>
 <p>The sensors of No.3 showed that the young robot girl had already entered the “dormant” state. When the remaining 60% of energy was also consumed, the young robot girl would not longer be able to conduct any activities at all. The robots started to use their energy storage to start moving towards z-b23.</p>
 <p>No.1’s processor showed 47% of remaining energy. Since No.1 consumed the most energy out of the robots, No.1 reached out its robotic arm, disconnecting its energy transfer line and connecting it to the energy storage box on No.2. The system immediately showed that No.2’s energy level started gradually increasing from 61%. When No.2 sent out the signal of being fully charged, No.1 only had 3% of energy left. Once the energy storage of the Venus robots reaches less than 3%, they lose all ability to move. At that moment, No.1’s robotic arm also lost the ability to fly or grab hold of anything. It merely floated in the dark universe, using the remaining bits of its energy to watch over No.2 and No.3 as they advanced towards sector z-b23, away from itself.</p>
 <p>As it gazed into the dark and desolate universe, No.1 had never felt so lucky as to be able to host a library program. Even at this moment, it was still able to accurately calculate a method to save another robot.</p>
