 <p>Chapter&nbsp;184: His Majesty wants to save A'Mo&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector took the chance early next morning to flee the house before his little brother woke up. He ran all the way to the palace, preparing to express his gratitude to Ning Xiaoyao. By the time he reached the gates, the skies were just beginning to get light. He assumed that he’d only be waiting a short while at the entrance, but the gatekeeper shook his head and said, “His Majesty isn’t at the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty didn’t return to the palace last night!?” the Lord Protector said, startled. </span><i><span style>Did something happen in the capital yesterday?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The gatekeeper wore a strange expression on his face before he said, “If the Lord Protector has urgent business, you can find His Majesty at the Grand Preceptor’s estate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor’s estate!?” Now the Lord Protector’s thoughts went wild. </span><i><span style>Did that old geezer Xie Wenyuan die finally?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The gatekeeper continued, “This one doesn’t know what happened.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector wasn’t expecting to find out anything from the gatekeeper either, so he turned and mounted his horse. Now he was heading for the Grand Preceptor’s estate to see what the fuss was all about. Once the gatekeeper saw him leave with his guards, he turned to his fellow guard and muttered, “I thought I was having hearing problems.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His companion couldn’t help but involuntarily recall His Majesty’s words when he ran out of the palace gates. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘I have to save A’Mo ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh～‘</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander couldn’t even catch up to His Majesty on his horse,” another guard sighed with great feeling. When all of them recalled how His Majesty could run faster than any horse, their mouths twitched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander looked like he was about to die from rage,” another guard piped up. Once again, everyone’s mouth twitched. It was rare to see Supreme Commander Lou so absolutely livid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m curious, who could this A’Mo be?” a guard taller than the rest asked. All of the guards exchanged glances. A’Mo sounded like a man’s name, but they didn’t know any of the specifics.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It must be very lively over at the Grand Preceptor’s estate now,” the gatekeeper who’d spoken to the Lord Protector remarked raptly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t call that ‘lively.’ His Majesty’s going to do something to the Grand Preceptor again,” the superior of this particular batch of guards opened his mouth to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said everyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Over at the Grand Preceptor’s estate, Ning Xiaoyao was speaking to Xie Anji, who was blocking the door to the study. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you keep on acting like this, I’m going to get physical.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji’s face stiffened at the threat, but he still didn’t budge. Ning Xiaoyao next tried to grab him by the collar, but their height differences were too much, so she only caught the front of his shirt and threw him behind her. Xie Anji used to oversee the military, so he knew some skills of his own, but he hadn’t expected this move from someone so ordinary-looking. Under the eyes of everyone present, he was sent flying into the air. Meanwhile, Lou Zigui silently withdrew his hand. Miss Ning’s superhuman strength left him no chance to take action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Windy,” Ning Xiaoyao said next, “I’ve been looking at the Grand Preceptor’s estate and its people, they’ve seemed like they’re plotting a rebellion. Guard them all well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” went the members of the Grand Preceptor’s estate. </span><i><span style>Is there any logic to this?! You’re accusing us of rebellion just because we’re walking around our own estate hunting for ant colonies?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale didn’t say a word. He brought his Dragon Guards to cause trouble for the Xie Clan stewards. Ning Xiaoyao kicked open the study door and strode inside, making everyone’s heart clench in suspense </span><i><span style>Can our Grand Preceptor survive this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui followed her inside and was assaulted by the strong stench of medicine. He gave a start. </span><i><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie really has fallen ill?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A few doctors were kneeling by the Grand Preceptor’s bed, but now they bowed to Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you may rise,” Ning Xiaoyao ran to Grand Preceptor Xie’s bed to peer at the man lying on the bed. The doctors rose to their feet and raised their heads to see Lou Zigui. In their fright, they quickly ducked their heads back down again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Aiya, </span></i><span style>who’s this?” Ning Xiaoyao exclaimed loudly. Lou Zigui reached the bed next and had a fright after seeing Grand Preceptor Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Tsk,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao clicked her tongue. “This face and those eyelids are as swollen as monkey butts. My God, the lips are nothing more that a pair of sausages now. Grand Preceptor, you’re nothing but </span><i><span style>this</span></i><span style> now, but you’re still alive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both the doctors and the people outside the door were rendered speechless at Ning Xiaoyao’s sharp tongue. </span><i><span style>Your Majesty, do you have to be so vicious with your tongue?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie’s eyes were so swollen that he could only squint. When he saw Ning Xiaoyao, his chest heaved violently, his throat acting like a bellows to expel his huffing breaths. Ning Xiaoyao raised a hand to lift the covers over his body. Currently, Grand Preceptor Xie was dressed in nothing but his undershirt, so her action caused him to cry out. Lou Zigui quickly pulled Ning Xiaoyao behind him. </span><i><span style>You’re not allowed to look at old men’s bodies, either!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao only stood behind Lou Zigui while grinning. She proclaimed loudly, “</span><i><span style>Aiyamaya, </span></i><span style>Grand Preceptor, why are you so swollen? Your entire body’s swelled up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie was shuddering all over. The doctors suspected that if he could move right now, he’d fight to the death against His Majesty. Lou Zigui covered Grand Preceptor Xie up again and asked the doctors, “What’s happened to the Grand Preceptor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One doctor answered, “To reply Supreme Commander, Grand Preceptor seems to have been bitten by some kind of insect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gave a snort. “First bitten by a mouse, now bitten by insects. Grand Preceptor, tell </span><i><span style>me </span></i><span style>the truth, just how did you offend the Heavens?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie strove to open his eyes, but all he could see was reduced to a thin line. “How did Your Majesty find out that this subject was ill?” Grand Preceptor Xie asked Ning Xiaoyao. He’d been bitten by insects and just called for a doctor, so the news hadn’t be publicized yet. </span><i><span style>When did Ning Yu find out?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gave a snort. </span><i><span style>Of course it’s all because Cousin Magpie told me that the Grand Preceptor’s estate was going to exterminate all of the ant nests. He found me to save all the ants.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!?” Grand Preceptor Xie intoned heavily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “I was sitting around in the palace when I suddenly felt restless and sensed that you were in trouble, Grand Preceptor. Then I came to take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said everyone outside. </span><i><span style>Do </span></i><b><i>you</i></b><i><span style> even believe your own words, Your Majesty?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “Did he faint?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father!” Xie Anji picked himself up from the ground and rushed into the study.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impudence!” Lou Zigui roared. “Get out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji looked at Ning Xiaoyao and Lou Zigui, his eyes bloodshot. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“They weren’t ants,” Grand Preceptor Xie opened his eyes again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, I don’t think they were ants, either,” Ning Xiaoyao agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie said, “Whether it thunders or rains is all up to the sovereign’s grace. Your Majesty, this subject can take it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao blinked. </span><i><span style>We’re talking about ants, so why are you rambling about thunderstorms now? How do they have any relation to each other?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s voice was ice cold. “Grand Preceptor certainly shows discretion with your speech.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded seriously despite having no idea what the Grand Preceptor meant. “Grand Preceptor, you’re great at making up nonsense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie said, “Then does Your Majesty wish this subject dead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao reached out a hand to check the Grand Preceptor’s injuries, then withdrew it halfway after some thought. She asked the doctors, “How is the Grand Preceptor doing with his illness? Is it fatal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The same doctor who’d spoken up before answered again, “To reply Your Majesty, the Grand Preceptor’s injuries won’t take his life.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dammnit! </span></i><span style>Highly disappointed, Ning Xiaoyao pursed her lips and said, “Oh, so it’s like that. Then I’m very happy, heheh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said everyone else. </span><i><span style>This is what you look like when you’re happy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie had just convinced himself that Ning Xiaoyao poisoned him, but he was now doubting his guess since he wasn’t fatally ill. </span><i><span style>If she had really decided to poison me, why wouldn’t she pick one that killed me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao next asked the doctor, “Then when will the Grand Preceptor get well? He’s swollen all over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This commoner doesn’t know,” the doctor replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie stared from Ning Xiaoyao to Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>Military power, </span></i><span style>he decided, </span><i><span style>Ning Yu is forcing my Xie Clan to the brink, which is why she hasn’t killed us yet. This is a warning from her that it’d be simple to end my life. </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Grand Preceptor, you’re overthinking things. </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father,” Xie Anji spoke up, “His Majesty ordered people to sweep and confiscate items from our estate!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, hey,” Ning Xiaoyao turned towards the man. “Don’t speak nonsense. When did I say such a thing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did not Your Majesty order watches on all the members of the Grand Preceptor’s estate?” Xie Anji knew the differences between sovereign and subject, but he was risking everything to flare up at Ning Xiaoyao now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh, are you stupid?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the doctors quietly backed away, suspecting His Majesty would drive Second Young Master Xie mad. Lou Zigui looked coldly at the heaving, seething Xie Anji. </span><i><span style>Xie Wenyuan wants to recommend this piece of garbage for the Nine Gates Infantry Commander post? </span></i><span style>Supreme Commander Lou felt like he was looking at a joke. Meanwhile, Grand Preceptor Xie was staring coldly at Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Last night, I sent troops to encircle Iron Buddha Temple, so Ning Yu ordered someone to poison me in retaliation. In the end, she’d still after the Zhou Clan soldiers...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was simply baring her fists at Xie Anji. “Are you going to walk out on your own, or do I have to make you leave myself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji figured that a scholar accepted death over humiliation, so he decided on a life and death struggle with Ning Yu, the ungrateful wretch. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get out,” Grand Preceptor Xie spoke up just then. “His Majesty is here, so you mustn’t be impudent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father!” Xie Anji couldn’t believe his ears. </span><i><span style>We still have to endure even when things have come to this?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Get out!” </span></i><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hear that?” Ning Xiaoyao said cheerfully. “Daddy told you to get out. You have to listen to daddy’s words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji slammed the door as he stalked outside. Ning Xiaoyao asked Grand Preceptor Xie, “Why is he so temperamental? Grand Preceptor, you’ve spoiled your son rotten.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The doctors were all wondering whether or not they could leave. </span><i><span style>We really want to get out of here, ah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie said, “Anji has a very blunt personality. Your Majesty, you should know your second uncle’s temper.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The heck you’re talking about?” Ning Xiaoyao glared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie said, “Your Majesty called Anwu your fourth uncle once, so wouldn’t Anji be your second uncle?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stared at the monkey’s butt that was the Grand Preceptor’s face. </span><i><span style>Even like this, he doesn’t forget to annoy me. Is he really the type who fights until their dying breath? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie laughed. “This subject understands Your Majesty’s views. However, this subject cannot abide by them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>In other words, this bastard’s not letting A’Mo and the rest off?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: How do I put it? The two of you are thinking about completely different things ah, </span></i><span style>╮(╯▽╰)╭ )</span></p>
