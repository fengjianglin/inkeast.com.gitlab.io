 <p>Chapter&nbsp;84: His Majesty says, it's a long story<span class="hidden-text">&nbsp;Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt held onto his bottle of oil, staring at the wall that used to be perfectly fine a second ago. Now it had been completely replaced with a scene of a massacre. He’d taken the time it took to brew a cup of tea to run to the store and back. </span><i><span style>Things changed this much? What happened?</span></i> <i><span style>Did I end up on the wrong street?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>While Shadowbolt was doubting his own memory, someone approached him from behind and patted his shoulder. The fourth commander of the Dragon Guards leapt up into the air before turning to punch the other person. Lou Zigui ducked under the blow and avoided Shadowbolt’s fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander?” Shadowbolt stopped moving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui could tell that Shadowbolt’s stare was probing him. This was one of the Dragon Guard’s four commanders, so his martial arts skills were uncommonly good. But Shadowbolt hadn’t noticed him until he patted the man’s shoulder. Just what kind of martial arts was Supreme Commander practicing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt pointed behind him and said somewhat awkwardly, “W-wall’s gone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Lou Zigui replied. “His Majesty broke it down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said Shadowbolt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I saw it myself,” Lou Zigui added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah? AH!” Shadowbolt looked back at the two groups of fighting people. “His Majesty’s snow wolf pup was stuck in a hole beneath the wall, so His Majesty must have torn down the wall to save the wolf. That’s right, that has to be it!” Finally, the fourth commander of the Dragon Guards had arrived at the truth. Behind him, Lou Zigui and his accompanying Dragon Guards were all silent. </span><i><span style>All that fuss came from saving a fat little wolf pup?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt held his bottle of oil in one hand and his sword handle in the other. “Supreme Commander, I’m going to help them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui glanced at a Dragon Guard behind him. This Dragon Guard stepped forward and replaced the bottle in Shadowbolt’s hands with a barrel of oil. Shadowbolt glanced at the oil barrel in his arms, then at Lou Zigui. He had a bad feeling about this. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go over there and burn that grove of bamboo trees,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Arson?” Shadowbolt still looked somewhat dazed. They’d recently set fire to the Grand Preceptor’s estate, but now Supreme Commander wanted to burn Prince Zhi’s side courtyard, too? </span><i><span style>Does Supreme Commander enjoy setting fires just like how His Majesty enjoys tearing down walls?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“In a bit, I’ll take some people to save them,” Lou Zigui said. “You have His Majesty and the rest escape into the streets. Grand Preceptor Xie is there. You’ll be protecting the Grand Preceptor as you escape. Do you catch my drift?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt shook his head. He didn’t get it. Why did they have to escape? And even protect the Grand Preceptor along the way?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s impossible to explain it clearly in a short time. Just do as I say.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But what about His Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell His Majesty it’s my idea, and that he has to do it that way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt looked at Lou Zigui, who didn’t seem like he was joking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry and go,” Lou Zigui slapped Shadowbolt’s shoulder again. He couldn’t help but feel like this guy was still in a stupor, though he didn’t know why. Shadowbolt sucked in a breath as he turned and prepared to leave with the oil barrel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hold on,” Lou Zigui handed over a set of outer robes to Shadowbolt. “Wrap up your head.” Afraid that Shadowbolt still didn’t get it, Supreme Commander Lou pointed at Ning Xiaoyao and the rest. Like them, Shadowbolt wrapped up his head to conceal his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have to protect His Majesty well,” Lou Zigui urged one more time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said the Dragon Guards by Lou Zigui’s side. </span><i><span style>His Majesty knocked down a wall with one kick and two punches. Does His Majesty even need guards with his superhuman strength? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt charged forward with his barrel of oil. Currently, Ning Xiaoyao was throwing bricks left and right. She’d managed to knock down two guards charging her way before bending down to pick up some more. Even though she’d knocked out more than half the teeth in Prince Zhi’s mouth, Ning Xiaoyao still felt that was letting him off lightly. After all, he had private affairs with the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu! </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: It’s not an affair…</span></i><span style>) </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt had excellent lightness techniques, so he arrived at the bamboo grove in a flash. When he saw Xie Laifu standing to one side, he asked, “Do you have any matches?” He couldn’t set a fire with oil alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Laifu was shaking with fear as he handed over a match from his pocket. Shadowbolt drenched the perimeter of the bamboo grove in oil before striking the match and tossing it into the liquid. Second Steward Xie only figured out what was up when he saw the flames. </span><i><span style>Mother and father! They’re committing arson as well?! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt didn’t dawdle one second when the fires started raging. He ran to Ning Xiaoyao’s side and told her everything that Lou Zigui had said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How come?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know,” Shadowbolt admitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Capture the assassins!” There was the sound of hoofbeats coming from the end of the street, coupled with loud shouts. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander’s coming!” Shadowbolt cried. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it,” Ning Xiaoyao stuffed the snow wolf pup’s head back into her robes and shouted towards Shadowgale and the rest, “Withdraw!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guards followed Ning Xiaoyao to the opposite end of the street with a hundred or so estate guards in hot pursuit. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chase them!” the wounded Prince Zhi was still next to the bamboo grove, shouting angrily at the top of his lungs. “Capture all those assassins for this prince!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Put out the fire!” the steward of the side courtyard shouted as he stomped his feet. With oil supporting the flames, they soon rolled up like a cat amidst the bamboo before engulfing the flower beds in the courtyard. Then the wind carried the flames to burn away the covered walkway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go!” Prince Xi dragged Prince Zhi as he ran for the front gates. “I saw Lou Zigui bringing his men here, we’ll leave this place to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even as Prince Zhi was dragged along, he didn’t forget to order his guards. “This prince saw that steward from the Grand Preceptor’s estate! Capture that damnable thing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” the guards loudly obeyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Xie Laifu had just locked gazes with Lou Zigui astride his horse. He felt like peeing his pants. Something about the entire situation felt </span><i><span style>off. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry and send news to the Nine Gate Infantry Commander’s estate!” Grand Preceptor Xie was currently sitting in his sedan chair and issuing orders to his guards. “Have them send people here to help!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His guard was about to leave with the orders when Ning Xiaoyao’s group ran out into the streets. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Shadowbolt said as he pointed to Grand Preceptor Xie’s sedan chair. “That’s the Grand Preceptor’s sedan chair.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” said Ning Xiaoyao. “Thanks, Fourth Lightning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other Dragon Guards all rolled their eyes at Shadowbolt. The streets had long cleared out of people besides the Grand Preceptor’s men. Who else could this sedan chair belong to, besides him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are assas--” Before a guard could finish his shout, Ning Xiaoyao bricked him. The Grand Preceptor’s guard fell unconscious to the ground before he could utter a word. The rest of the Grand Preceptor’s guards quickly unsheathed their weapons, just as the guards chasing after Ning Xiaoyao’s group emerged on their other side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Release the arrows!” the head of the guards ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re not part of them, we’re--” a Grand Preceptor guard wanted to explain that they weren’t the assassins, but Shadowgale and the rest simply rushed forward, picked up the sedan chair, and ran. A few of the Dragon Guards stayed behind to deflect the incoming arrows. The Grand Preceptor’s guards couldn’t just stand and let themselves be shot, either, so they deflected the arrows as well. In the eyes of their attackers, they looked like they were on one team. (o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao ran along with the sedan chair. Although she had short legs, she ended up leading the group at the very front. What else could the Grand Preceptor’s guards do, now that their master had been kidnapped? Chase after him, of course!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that the Grand Preceptor?” a guard from Prince Xi’s estate asked a man beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard someone shouting ‘Grand Preceptor’ up front,” a guard from Prince Zhi’s estate replied.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So it was the Grand Preceptor who’d sent those assassins?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of the estate guards were stunned. </span><i><span style>Is Grand Preceptor Xie planning to revolt?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you people?” the very Grand Preceptor Xie suspected of rebellion was shouting questions at the men carrying his sedan chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the Dragon Guards just kept running without saying a word. The sedan chair jolted and tossed its occupant back and forth, making Grand Preceptor Xie nauseous. In the end, he opened his mouth and threw up on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao,” At the sound of a voice above her head, Ning Xiaoyao looked up and saw Wifey Magpie flying in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hm?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “Wifey Magpie, which relative did you call on today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I went to see my older female cousin, ah” Wifey Magpie replied. “Xiaoyao, why are you running along with the Grand Preceptor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wore a pained expression. “It’s a long story.” It really was a long story, because she had no idea what Supreme Commander Lou was planning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wifey Magpie asked, “Are those people behind you chasing you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Turn left at the intersection up ahead,” Wifey Magpie said, “There’s a mistress of the Grand Preceptor living in the 10th house on the right. Xiaoyao, you can bring the Grand Preceptor there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>So the Grand Preceptor has a mistress too, hehe.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Are we going back to the palace?” Shadowgale asked as he caught up behind Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Ning Xiaoyao replied, “Follow me. I know where the Grand Preceptor’s mistress lives.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Shadowgale. </span><i><span style>The Grand Preceptor already has one wife and fifteen concubines, but he’s still raising a mistress outside the estate?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At the intersection, everyone saw the two groups of people running their way with weapons in hand. Frightened, they scattered and ducked away as Ning Xiaoyao turned left and ran to the 10th house on the right side. The house had a rather large door, painted with black lacquer. It was tightly shut. Ning Xiaoyao kicked open the door with her foot and waved at her Dragon Guard pals. “Hurry and go inside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale and the rest, along with the Grand Preceptor’s own guards, all rushed into the door before the head commander slammed it shut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is it?” a short, fat </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>ran out from the walkway directly facing the gates. Grand Preceptor Xie held onto the carriage doors as he descended the sedan chair with difficulty. </span><i><span style>What kind of person ate a bear’s heart and leopard’s gall, to have the guts to kidnap his carriage!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor’s arrived?” the chubby </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>suddenly broke into smiles as she ran towards him. Then she shouted back into the walkway, “Lady Xiang,[1. </span><i><span style>Lady Xiang </span></i><span style>(湘夫人) - </span><i><span style>Xiang </span></i><span style>is also short for 湘江, which is a river in Hunan Province.] the Grand Preceptor’s arrived!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stood on the side as she whispered to Shadowgale at the rest. “Hear that? His mistress’s name is Lady Xiang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale said, “Your Majesty, what are we planning to do this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “I don’t know, ah. Urk, maybe catch adulterers in the act?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said the Dragon Guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, looks like none of you want to do that,” Ning Xiaoyao gave up the idea when none of her Dragon Guards spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s it to us if the Grand Preceptor has a mistress? </span></i><span style>The Dragon Guards couldn’t figure it out. Why should they catch an adulterer? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie pushed aside the chubby </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>before him and pointed a finger at Ning Xiaoyao. “Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao kept her mouth shut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That figure,” Grand Preceptor Xie stared at Ning Xiaoyao. “You’re His Majesty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head while feeling extremely sorrowful. Was her figure really that distinctive?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Open the doors!” the sound of pounding doors sounded from outside. The guards from the prince’s estate had caught up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie pointed his finger a few more times at Ning Xiaoyao. “Your Majesty has taken great cares.” In order to stop him from forming an alliance with the imperial clansmen, Ning Yu had done a good job framing him for the crime.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Taken great cares? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought. </span><i><span style>What kind of care did I take? Dammnit, the Grand Preceptor’s words sound way too mysterious.</span></i></p>
