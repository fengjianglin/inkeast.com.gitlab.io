 <p>Chapter&nbsp;180: The empress is a pawn&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Ning Xiaoyao and Lou Zigui were leaning against the Wutong tree as they sat and talked, Shadowgale and the rest had already safely escorted Empress Zhou to the Iron Buddha Temple situated in the mountains north of the capital. It was currently nighttime, so no one was burning incense or praying to Buddha. The temple was currently devoid of worshippers, so when Shadowgale’s team of Dragon Guards entered through the gates, they startled all the monks inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The head monk Grandmaster Kumu[1. </span><i><span style>Grandmaster Kumu </span></i><span style>(枯木大师) - </span><i><span style>Kumu dashi, </span></i><span style>in which </span><i><span style>Kumu </span></i><span style>means “dead tree.”] exited from the living quarters at the rear of the temple with the steward monk while nine others moved to Shadowgale’s side. The empress had told Shadowgale before they arrived to not reveal her identity, and that she hadn’t been expelled from the palace. Head Commander Shadowgale took her words as a royal decree and asked, “Where is Zhou Junqi?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandmaster Kumu gave a start at Shadowgale’s question. “This excellency, Zhuo Xing[2. </span><i><span style>Zhuo Xing </span></i><span style>(拙行) - “clumsy/awkward behavior/conduct,” the Dharma name of Zhou Junqi.] has already withdrawn from worldly affairs. He is a criminal as well, but your excellency still wishes to see him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the previous emperor had ordered Zhou Junqi to become a monk, he took on the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma_name" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>Dharma name</span></a><span style> of Zhuo Xing. Shadowgale only feigned ignorance and retorted coldly, “I came upon imperial decree. Don’t waste words with me, Grandmaster, where is Zhou Junqi? Don’t blame us for His Majesty’s wrath if you hinder our work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale’s rude, unreasonable attitude forced Grandmaster Kumu to back down and keep quiet. No matter how high his status was amongst his fellow monks, how could it compare to imperial might? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Excellency, please come this way,” Grandmaster Kumu led the way. Standing behind them, Empress Zhou trembled at the prospect of seeing her long estranged brother. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>supported her and murmured, “Empress, you must keep calm. Wouldn’t eldest young master feel miserable otherwise?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The empress raised a hand to rub at her eyes before she nodded. Shadowgale glanced at the monks trailing behind them and ordered Grandmaster Kumu, “There’s no need for all these people to follow us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandmaster Kumu waved a hand to dismiss his monks. The remaining line of people followed Grandmaster Kumu for about the length of time it took to burn a stick of incense before they arrived at a long and narrow path. At the end of the path was a solitary courtyard where a monk dressed in ash-gray robes was standing by the door. He had no left hand and it looked like he’d been waiting for quite a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandmaster may withdraw,” Shadowgale had never seen Zhou Junqi before, but the missing hand was proof of the monk’s identity as Empress Zhou’s brother. Grandmaster Kumu pressed his palms together in a </span><a href="https://www.yogajournal.com/practice/the-meaning-of-quot-namaste-quot" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>namaste</span></a><span style> as he murmured a Buddha’s name, then turned to leave. Empress Zhou made a move to step forward but Zhao </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>tightly held her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Junqi looked at the row of people before him. Aside from a few monks, he hadn’t seen any other outsiders during his years here. Now he was unused to the sight of strangers and their unshaved heads. Shadowgale glanced at Zhou Junqi and noted that he resembled the empress somewhat, but his skin was very white from extended periods without sunlight. He was also an extremely tall man, but thin, with his robes hanging loosely off his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Head Commander,” a Dragon Guard by Shadowgale’s side murmured. “That Grandmaster Kumu hasn’t left yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale turned to peer into the darkness, but he couldn’t see anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His footsteps stopped as soon as he walked out of the entrance,” the Dragon Guard added. Of all the men Shadowgale brought with him today, this one had the best hearing. Shadowgale trusted his words and patted his shoulders, before clearing his throat. Then he told Zhou Junqi. “Zhou Junqi, accept this decree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Junqi fell to his knees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neither the empress nor Zhou </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>knew what Ning Xiaoyao had decreed, so they held their breaths to listen closely. Shadowgale simply repeated Lou Zigui’s words as the imperial decree for Zhou Junqi to hear. When Zhou Junqi realized that the current sovereign wanted to conduct a retrial for his losses against the bandits in the past, his mind went blank and blocked out the rest of Shadowgale’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhou Junqi,” Shadowgale said, “You’re still not accepting the decree and thanking His Majesty for his grace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jolted back to his senses, Zhou Junqi kowtowed and did just that. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Kumu headed silently back to the main temple. The late emperor had been a believer of Buddhism who’d never shirked in his donations to Iron Buddha Temple. However, the support from the imperial family had stopped after the current emperor took to the throne. One could well tell his attitude towards them. (</span><i><span style>Author: Grandmaster, do you believe me when I say His Majesty will bite you to death if you ask for donations now? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Moreover, </span></i><span style>Grandmaster Kumu thought, </span><i><span style>Because of one word from me, the current emperor had never stepped into the palace before he took the throne. Will he seek retribution for that slight? </span></i><span style>He was the very one who said that Empress Dowager Xie and Ning Xiaoyao weren’t compatible at birth and should be kept apart. Now Grandmaster Kumu simply shook his head. </span><i><span style>What’s inevitable can’t be avoided. I’ll listen to Heaven’s will.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Fellow Brother,” the steward monk of the temple, Grandmaster Kumu’s younger monk brother, walked out from a small path in the woods. He was known as Grandmaster Chen Mu.[3. </span><i><span style>Chen Mu </span></i><span style>(忱木) - </span><i><span style>Chen </span></i><span style>is “sincere feeling, true sentiment,” </span><i><span style>Mu </span></i><span style>is “wood.”]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty wants to reverse the verdict for Zhuo Xing,” Grandmaster Kumu replied. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandmaster Chen Mu said, “His Majesty doesn’t get along with the Grand Preceptor, so it’s logical that he’ll reverse the verdict for his brother-in-law’s sake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Monastics like us shouldn’t involve themselves in these affairs,” Grandmaster Kumu replied as he kept walking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I saw two women in that group,” Grandmaster Chen Mu continued as he followed him. “Why would His Majesty send women to see Zhou Xing? Unless they’re…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t say any more,” Grandmaster Kumu cut him off before lowering his voice. “This humble monk once committed a grave blunder, but now you wish me to make another?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandmaster Chen Mu fell silent at his words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale didn’t stay long, but took his leave after watching Empress Zhou and Zhou </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>enter the courtyard. The Zhou siblings hadn’t seen each other for years. They looked at each other, wanting to cry but unable to, as they thought of their now distant past. Zhou </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>stood outside the house as the two siblings reunited. After a long time, she finally heard the empress break out into bitter sobs and shed some tears of her own. Their family was broken up, its members dead or scattered. Anyone who hadn’t experienced the pain themselves would never be able to understand such blood-soaked agony and hatred. </span></p>
 <p><span style>While Shadowgale and the rest rode off on their horses, an old and unremarkable monk quickly finished penning a letter in his quarters, sealed it up, and ordered one of his young disciples to take it. “The city gates are already shut at this hour, but if you call out the name of Iron Buddha Temple, a soldier will let down a basket for you. Place this letter in that basket.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little monk accepted the letter with a word of assent before turning to run out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the meanwhile, Mute Nanny was brought by a Dragon Guard into Lou Zigui’s quarters at Supreme Splendor Hall. A little nervous, she greeted the man in his chair with a bow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take a trip over to the empress dowager’s palace,” Lou Zigui said when she was done. “And tell her that Esteemed Empress has been sent to Iron Buddha Temple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mute Nanny opened her mouth in a silent </span><i><span style>‘ah,’ </span></i><span style>before waving her hands at Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “I’m well aware of your situation. But since His Majesty is willing to use you, I won’t go against his wishes, either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mute Nanny dropped her hands to her sides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remember to tell the empress dowager everything exactly as I’ve said,” Lou Zigui added. Mute Nanny quickly moved her hands to reply, signing with her fingers very quickly. Lou Zigui’s lips quirked upwards before he added, “I can’t understand your sign language. I’ve brought this up to His Majesty, but he still wouldn’t let you go. Even if you say nothing about Esteemed Empress, the empress dowager will find out eventually. However, I still think it’s better if you make a trip to showcase your loyalty while saving the empress dowager some time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mute Nanny thought Lou ZIgui’s words over briefly before nodding in agreement. She was quite clear on the relationship between His Majesty and Supreme Commander Lou; at this point in time, the man had no reason to harm His Majesty. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“And also,” Lou Zigui went on, “Tell the empress dowager that you faintly heard His Majesty losing his temper, saying that the empress betrayed him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chen </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>and the rest were rescued from the rubble of the empress’s buildings, they were locked up in the torture chambers. Empress Dowager Xie had already found out and was losing her temper at her own </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>when a servant reported that Mute Nanny had requested an audience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie told all her servants to withdraw before summoning the old woman into her palace. Mute Nanny knelt on the ground and made hand signs to the empress dowager to report how the empress had gone to Iron Buddha Temple. Empress Dowager Xie lifted a hand to signal her to rise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did His Majesty send the empress out of the palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mute Nanny signed back, </span><i><span style>‘His Majesty said the empress dowager wants to harm the empress.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Utterly ludicrous,” Empress Dowager Xie muttered under her breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mute Nanny’s hands fell as she waited for Empress Dowager Xie’s next signal. Meanwhile, the woman was pondering over two questions in her head. </span><b><i>One</i></b><i><span style>, was the empress really pregnant? And </span></i><b><i>two</i></b><i><span style>, did Ning Yu know about the potential pregnancy? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Mute Nanny seemed to suddenly remember something and signaled Empress Dowager Xie again, </span><i><span style>‘His Majesty lost his temper in Supreme Splendor Hall after coming back from the empress’s palace. This servant heard from a distance that His Majesty said the empress had betrayed her.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie raised her eyes to look at Mute Nanny. “Is that really what His Majesty said?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mute Nanny first nodded, then shook her head and signed, </span><i><span style>‘This servant only heard it from a distance. But His Majesty was definitely mad because of Esteemed Empress.’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why would Ning Yu be angry because of the empress? The empress betrayed her? </span></i><span style>Empress Dowager Xie mulled over Mute Nanny’s words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Empress Dowager,” a eunuch called from outside the doors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Empress Dowager Xie asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>and the rest have died in the the torture chambers,” the eunuch replied. “It was His Majesty who decreed their deaths.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie fell silent for a while, then replied, “I know now, withdraw.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” the eunuch left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie next looked at Mute Nanny. “Is His Majesty still angry right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mute Nanny signed back, </span><i><span style>‘His Majesty summoned Supreme Commander Lou to talk, they seemed to be discussing something.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie nodded before waving to dismiss her. Mute Nanny knelt down to kowtow once and withdrew. On the ceiling rafters, Oil Jar quietly asked Grandpa Ash, “What is Supreme Commander planning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandpa Ash only shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar looked disappointed. “You don’t know either, Ancestral Grandfather?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandpa Ash replied, “Supreme Commander has his eyes set on the Zhou Clan troops. The empress is nothing more than a pawn in their games.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oil Jar doesn’t understand,” Oil Jar said, confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then that’s good,” Grandpa Ash replied. “It’s better off not understanding human affairs like these.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar still didn’t understand, but before he could ask any more questions, Empress Dowager Xie chuckled and called out, “Someone, come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar crept across the rafters and stuck his head out to peer below. Empress Dowager Xie was now talking to a </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>who had quickly walked inside. “Find a way to send a message to the Grand Preceptor’s estate. Tell the Grand Preceptor that the empress is pregnant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>gave a start, but didn’t dare ask any more. She accepted the orders and left. Soon afterwards, another </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>walked in with Prince Cheng, Ning Xin, in her arms. Empress Dowager Xie accepted her little son from the servant and kissed him on the face with a murmur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For your sake, imperial mother is willing to do anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>by her side didn’t dare to make a peep. Oil Jar was scrambling around in frantic circles from the rafters. “Just what is the empress dowager planning?!” he asked Grandpa Ash.</span></p>
