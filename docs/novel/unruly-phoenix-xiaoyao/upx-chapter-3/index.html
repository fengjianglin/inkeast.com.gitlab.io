 <p>Chapter 3: Supreme Commander's<em>&nbsp;</em>charm transcends species boundaries&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ning Xiaoyao prepared to raise a fist, Empress Dowager Xie wiped her eyes and said in a low voice, “Yu’er, you can’t talk to This Dowager</span> <span style>like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” Ning Xiaoyao was mute. She hadn’t even made a move. All she did was say she wanted some peace and quiet, and this woman couldn’t take it anymore?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The walls have ears in the palace, too. I didn’t mind when it was only you speaking to This Dowager</span> <span style>just then, but if your imperial brothers’ spies spread news of this, they can accuse you of being unfilial,” Empress Dowager Xie was full of sincerity. “Of all virtues, filial piety is the most important. You can’t afford to be unfilial; otherwise, This Dowager</span> <span style>and your grandfather won’t be able to protect your title even if we risked our lives!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, Empress Dowager Xie raised her hand to lightly brush against the swollen lump on Ning Xiaoyao’s forehead. Her expression was filled with tender affection, while Ning Xiaoyao had been too surprised by her speech to move away. </span><i><span style>Just a few words could cost her the position of emperor? </span></i><span style>Then what if she killed her own mother? </span><i><span style>What would be the consequences for her then?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Silly child,” Empress Dowager Xie sighed. “If your Imperial Father hadn’t passed away so early and your little brother wasn’t just a newborn, how could This Dowager</span> <span style>bear to have you dress up as a boy and sit on the knife’s edge that is the emperor’s seat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao still wanted to make a move. This woman could act too well. </span><i><span style>Couldn’t bear to? </span></i><span style>When she killed her own daughter, why didn’t she seem unwilling at all?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Empress Dowager,” a </span><i><span style>mama’s</span></i><span style> [1. </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> (嬷嬷) - a form of address for an elderly female servant, also a wet nurse.]</span><span style> voice called from outside. “Prince Cheng is awake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You little brother woke up,” Empress Dowager Xie said in a rush to Ning Xiaoyao. “He's still young and cries when This Dowager</span> <span style>isn’t around after he wakes. This Dowager’s</span> <span style>going to see him. Your Majesty, you have to remember This Dowager’s</span> <span style>words. What happened then, can't happen again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a little person in Ning Xiaoyao’s heart waving a handkerchief at Empress Dowager Xie. </span><i><span style>See you some other time, but it’s best if we part and never meet again!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie still felt that there was something off about her daughter, but right now she was concerned about the son that’d just woken up from his midday nap. She put Ning Xiaoyao’s affairs to the back of her head. Compared to this chess piece, the child in her own palace was the true guarantee for her Xie family’s future riches and glory. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After Empress Dowager Xie left with her retainers, Ning Xiaoyao looked at the rest of the people standing by her side. She was about to ask them how she could avoid Empress Dowager Xie forever when she heard a voice coming from the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmiana_simplex" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>Wutong tree</span></a><span style> outside the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That ninny’s been tricked by that Xie Clan woman again, meow~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An emperor like her might as well die. Even the people by her side are all that Xie woman’s subordinates, meow~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked expressionlessly outside the window, where three fat, black, white, and yellow cats sat perched on the wutong tree’s leafy branches. During the last epoch of mankind, humanity had adapted itself to an environment unsuitable for human life. They evolved until their bodies surpassed that of normal humans and developed various abilities. Ning Xiaoyao had the power to heal. Although she couldn’t cure people bitten by zombies, she was still capable of treating diseases including malignant tumors and late stage cancer so that the patient could live for 10 to 20 more years. Besides that, she also possessed the power to understand animal speech. This ability was rather pointless during the apocalypse, since all the animals on land, in the air, or underwater had mutated into zombie beasts. Humanity couldn’t even ensure its own survival, much less keep pets, so Ning Xiaoyao’s second skill only allowed her to hear the animals crying out </span><i><span style>meat, meat, meat, I want to eat meat! </span></i><span style>（o(╯□╰)o）</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miaow,” the black cat that had kept silent all this time saw Ning Xiaoyao looking their way and swished its tail. “This ninny’s still looking at us. Supreme Commander’s</span> <span style>about to die, but she doesn’t even know to save him! Idiot! Blockhead! Go die, die, </span><i><span style>die!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Boss, calm your anger,” the yellow cat with a tummy as round as a ball spoke, “She’s just a puppet, so how can she save Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>?”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Meowmeow, that’s right, Big Boss,” the cat with long white fur added, “No matter how much we adore Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>it’s no use. These are human affairs, meow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the fur on the black cat stood on end as he arched his body and bared his teeth towards Ning Xiaoyao. It looked like he wanted to spring over and bite her to death. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” Ning Xiaoyao was speechless. </span><i><span style>Who was this Supreme Commander? Even cats were this person’s fans? This person’s charms were enough to transcend species boundaries?!</span></i></p>
