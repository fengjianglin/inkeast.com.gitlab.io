 <p>Chapter&nbsp;114: Supreme Commander says, you have to return them<span class="hidden-text">&nbsp;Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then...then what should I do now? I’ve already taken it apart,” Ning Xiaoyao asked anxiously. </span><i><span style>Make me pay Grand Preceptor Xie for repairs? I’d rather go back to my world of zombies!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui leaned forward slightly to cover Ning Xiaoyao as much as he possibly could from the rain. “Over time, it’s likely that archway would’ve broken down after constant rainstorms any way.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Broken down?</span></i><span style> Ning Xiaoyao dug her fingers into her palms. </span><i><span style>That’s right, why didn’t I think of a reason like that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, it’s not very effective if you take it down by night,” Lou Zigui added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn’t understand. “Then should I take it down during the day?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Find a chance to issue an imperial decree. Denounce the Grand Preceptor for being unworthy of an imperial archway and make the Xie Clan dismantle it themselves,” Lou Zigui said. “Then, have them send the timber, brick, and tiles back, untouched, to the imperial family. That’s a sure way to make them miserable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sucked in a breath as three words appeared in her head: </span><i><span style>You’re. So. Venomous!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you committed my words to your memory?” Lou Zigui lowered his head to rest his chin on Ning Xiaoyao’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded docilely. It looked like Supreme Commander Lou was even better at face-slapping than she was. When she recalled the huge debt of blood between them, she couldn’t help but wonder how Supreme Commander would slap her face in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you smash Tao Chen?” Lou Zigui asked. He hadn’t noticed Ning Xiaoyao’s inner grief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s already made plans with the Grand Preceptor,” Ning Xiaoyao rallied her spirits to speak again. “The Grand Preceptor came up with the idea, while Tao Chen’s going to put it into action. They want to murder Qin Xuan and Miss A’Xin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Lou Zigui said quietly before he fell silent. Wracked with a guilty conscience for her father’s misdeeds, Ning Xiaoyao kept quiet, as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Human lives are worthless,” Lou Zigui muttered to himself when he saw the imperial palace before them. Even in the rain, it was well-lit with lanterns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re not worthless,” Ning Xiaoyao lifted her head to look at him, her face serious. “They’re worth a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui lowered his head and saw the same set of eyes he’d seen in his dream: round, innocent, and completely ignorant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander, you can’t say things like that in the future,” Ning Xiaoyao said. When she thought of Supreme Commander’s deformed, possibly still-living older brother currently suffering in Northern </span><i><span style>Hu, </span></i><span style>her heart throbbed with discomfort again. She hung her head and murmured, “In, in any case, humans have to find a way to keep living. They can only find hope when they’re alive. They’ll have nothing if they die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if they’re living a life like pigs or dogs?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao blinked. “If pigs and dogs can live, why not humans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...........” said Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll do my best,” Ning Xiaoyao clenched her fists. Her words were meant for herself as much as Supreme Commander. People had to keep on living and fight for the life they wanted to have. This way, they’d be able to die without any regrets. Everyone in the apocalypse followed such beliefs. Ning Xiaoyao emerged from her difficulties ready to do battle again. Being sad was useless; it was more respectable to fight monsters and save people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui gave a soundless sigh. He lowered his head and rubbed his chin against Ning Xiaoyao’s wet hair, feeling helpless against the girl in his arms. Perhaps this was enough for now. He brought her on horseback into the palace gates and headed directly for Supreme Splendor Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>from the empress dowager’s palace waiting in front of the gates. When she saw Ning Xiaoyao approach, she quickly kneeled on the ground. After two </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>had suffered at the empress’s palace that day, this </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was trembling with fright. She was worried that one little mistake would end up triggering Ning Xiaoyao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on </span><i><span style>now?” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao grew exasperated as soon as she found out the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>had come from the empress dowager.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, Esteemed Empress Dowager’s palace had a leak in the roof,” the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes spun. She remembered how she’d forgotten to replace the roof tile over the empress dowager’s quarters after spying on her. Lou Zigui said coldly, “Does Esteemed Empress Dowager want His Majesty to fix her roof overnight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Th-that’s right,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Does she want me to climb on the roof and fix her house? I’m the emperor, alright? Can an emperor hold two jobs as a sovereign and a tiler?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“............” said everyone at the Supreme Splendor Hall. </span><i><span style>There’s no such thing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>kowtowed to Ning Xiaoyao and said, “Your Majesty, the rainwater ruined three chests of Esteemed Empress Dowager’s dance clothes. They were given to her by the late emperor. Because of this, Esteemed Empress Dowager was so saddened that she fainted away. The Imperial Physician Courtyard’s already sent people over to look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was beginning to suspect she’d heard the wrong thing. </span><i><span style>Dance clothes? She fainted for three chests’ worth of dance clothes? Is this a joke?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was already wiping away her tears by now. “Your Majesty, the late emperor personally bought those clothes for Esteemed Empress Dowager. It’s one of the memories he left behind for the empress dowager. Esteemed Empress Dowager…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough already,” Ning Xiaoyao curled her lips contemptuously. “He’s long dead and she’s still feeling lovesick? What was she doing while he was alive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else stood silently on the sides, pretending they hadn’t heard a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What exactly did you find me for?” Ning Xiaoyao asked the somewhat stunned looking </span><i><span style>mama. </span></i><span style>She wasn’t a tiler or a tailor, so what could she even do to help?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>said, “Esteemed Empress Dowager fainted, so we servants must report it to Your Majesty.” </span><i><span style>Your own mother lost consciousness. We’re only servants, so are we supposed to hide that it ever happened? </span></i><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>not only felt wronged, but angry as well. </span><i><span style>Why is it so hard to serve one’s master?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, so that’s it,” Ning Xiaoyao pulled the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>to her feet. “Then go back and tell the empress dowager that it’s too late to express her love now. Have her wash up and go to bed first. That there, my imperial father has the empress and the crown prince to keep him company on the other side. He’s perfectly fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said the </span><i><span style>mama.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“.............” said everyone else. </span><i><span style>Are you condemning that mama to death, or the empress dowager?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Dance clothes,” Ning Xiaoyao’s expression fell as she stalked into the Supreme Splendor Hall, muttering to herself. “Can’t you dance in any clothes you like? She really has a peculiar way of thinking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else followed His Majesty inside, leaving the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>to stand alone by the gates, dazed. Esteemed Empress Dowager hadn’t fainted away just because her dance clothes had been ruined! When she recalled the empress dowager’s instructions, then looked back at the retreating Ning Xiaoyao, she braced herself and chased after the emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was about to lose her patience when she saw her. “You still have business with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>fell to her knees in the rain. “Your Majesty, Esteemed Empress Dowager suspects that someone lifted a tile off the roof on purpose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao chuckled. </span><i><span style>So that’s the main point.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who would have the gall?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>remained kneeling and simply shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s been a long time,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “And it’s been raining constantly, right? The roof simply broke, that’s all. If there’s nothing suspicious, why is the empress dowager scaring herself over nothing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rubbed his nose after hearing Ning Xiaoyao paraphrasing his words. The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>hastened to speak, “Your Majesty, an eunuch went up to the roof to check. Only one tile on the roof was missing. It, it doesn’t look like it broke.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>In the future, I’ll have to remember to remove a few more tiles, </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao mentally reminded herself. “Then you’ll have to ask the roof about that. I haven’t been to the empress dowager’s palace before, so how am I supposed to know why the roof was only missing one tile?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was floored once again. No matter how reasonably she spoke, it was useless against someone who was a rascal. Moreover, this rascal was none other than the emperor, so she couldn’t say anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have the empress dowager wash up and sleep first. Does she still think she’s some sort of 18-year old blossom? Are people still crying and shouting just for a peek at her?” Ning Xiaoyao waved a hand at the </span><i><span style>mama. </span></i><span style>“Don’t treat a broken roof tile like the apocalypse. See you later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone cast sidelong glances at Ning Xiaoyao, who still had Supreme Commander’s outer robes draped over her shoulders. </span><i><span style>Are you cursing the empress dowager to death again? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As everyone else followed Ning Xiaoyao into the covered walkway and vanished, the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>from the empress dowager’s palace was left standing blankly in the rain. </span><i><span style>What ‘apocalypse?’ Ah no, that’s not right. How am I supposed to relay this message to Esteemed Empress Dowager?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao soundly kicked the door open and entered the main hall of her palace. She gave a sneeze before she called for Shadowgale. “Windy, where’s the giant bundle I told you to bring back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale ran behind a folding screen before he dragged out the big package. Erya and Xiaoqiu diligently trailed after him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s so many beads, Your Majesty! So many beads!” Erya waved her hands in delight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Ning Xiaoyao ran forward and undid the knot on the bundle. Then she lifted the lid off a chest and saw a chest full of </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cat%27s+eye+stone&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnqNGOps7XAhUM4YMKHSr_D1oQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1130&amp;bih=763" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>cat’s eye</span></a><span style> stones that nearly blinded her with their radiance. She straightened her back and calmed down before her trembling hand opened the second chest. This one was filled to the brim with jades and agates, which left her vision blind once more. “We’ve, we’ve struck it rich,” she stuttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui strode forward and picked up the oil-paper package before dumping out its contents. First came the silver drafts, which Supreme Commander Lou set in a thick stack on a tea table. Then came the letters, which Supreme Commander Lou looked through meticulously, one by one. Ning Xiaoyao scampered over to the tea table and began counting the silver drafts, trying to see how much money she had picked up this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guards joined Erya and her brother to stare at the two chests filled with treasure. They wouldn’t be able to earn this much even if they worked for their entire lives. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao finished tallying the money and returned to the chests, her back straight and her face smug. “There’s 30,000 taels’ worth of silver drafts there. We’re rich again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone mentally prostrated themselves before His Majesty. Ning Xiaoyao was even glowing in their eyes by now, her halo everlasting! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao casually picked up a cat’s eye and asked Shadowgale, “Windy, how much would these sell for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale shook his head. He really had no idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll save some to use for Erya’s dowry,” Ning Xiaoyao stroked Erya’s hair, which was still an unhealthy, yellowish hue. “The rest we can sell off for money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guards all looked at Erya and her yellowing hair. </span><i><span style>His Majesty really has foresight. He’s already thinking of Erya’s marriage affairs. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Erya, you choose,” Ning Xiaoyao said with all the airs of a nouveau riche. “Take anything you like.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erya looked timidly at the two chests full of treasures. She thought that every one of them looked nice, so it was hard to pick any one of them. Ning Xiaoyao pointed out a few pieces. “Choose the big ones. They’re worth more money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowthunder shook his head. “Your Majesty, these cat’s eye stones all look about the same size.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao then asked Shadowgale, “Which one’s worth more, the cat’s eye stones or the jade and agate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately, the people in the room split into two factions. There were those who supported the cat’s eyes, and those who supported the jade and agate. Neither side could win over the other as their arguments grew louder and more contentious. Ning Xiaoyao saw that the two factions of Dragon Guards were about to come to blows and couldn’t help but feel vexed. </span><i><span style>That’s the fate of the poor. We can’t tell what’s valuable and what’s not. If we could, our nouveau riche wouldn’t have so many troubles.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui put down the letter in his hand and spoke one line: “We can’t accept these things. We need to return them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the talking ceased in the room. Ning Xiaoyao stiffened as she turned around, the cat’s eye in her hand clattering back into the chest. “Whaa?” His Majesty Ning asked.</span></p>
