 <p>Chapter 39: His Majesty Ning fighting alone&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie was in an awkward, unfavorable plight. He could either turn hostile towards Ning Xiaoyao and thoroughly become her enemy, or kneel on the ground to admit his errors and ask for punishment. Who told him to be a subject while Ning Xiaoyao was the sovereign? Ning Xiaoyao earnestly wished that Grand Preceptor Xie could rush up and bite her right now so she had an excuse to beat him within an inch of his life. Empress Dowager Xie started to feel uneasy. Had Lou Zigui really died? Was this really His Majesty acting as if all hope was lost?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This subject doesn’t dare,” Grand Preceptor Xie knelt down with head bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>isn't mentally deficient?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the ministers stepped forward then to ask, “Your Majesty, what is ‘mentally deficient?’”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It means blockhead,” Ning Xiaoyao snapped in annoyance. </span><i><span style>The people in this world didn't even know what “mentally deficient” meant!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There were some ministers who suddenly wanted to laugh, but bit down painfully on their tongues to stop themselves. Ning Xiaoyao patted the armrest of the Dragon Throne and said,”Say something, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This subject doesn't dare. Your Majesty has been exceptionally intelligent since childhood,” the Grand Preceptor kowtowed to Ning Xiaoyao again. “The sun and moon themselves can stand witness to this subject’s care towards Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao narrowed her eyes. Just then, the Grand Preceptor was still angry, but now he had calmed down. Psychologically speaking, his mental fortitude was formidable. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the Grand Preceptor’s camp appeared to make their move. One minister stepped forward and said, “Since it was the late emperor’s wish…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hold it, you,” Ning Xiaoyao raised a hand towards the speaker. “Didn't you just hear the empress dowager say she was only a married woman? She hasn't even held court from behind a screen yet, and she's already crying like this. Do you want me to force her to her death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said the minister in question. </span><i><span style>His Majesty was a blackguard and a rascal, wasn't he?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty misunderstands,” Empress Dowager Xie hastened to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao replied, “Just then, the Grand Preceptor said that </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>has been exceptionally intelligent since childhood. How could </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>still not understand what others mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie dearly regretted her actions now. Why had she pretended to be modest and unassuming while showing off her weak side? “How could we disobey the late emperor’s last will?” she asked, using the late emperor to directly suppress Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The late emperor’s last will,” Ning Xiaoyao echoed, “Does it come with an imperial edict?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These were the late emperor’s verbal instructions,” said Grand Preceptor Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who heard them?” Ning Xiaoyao asked again. “Does a last will exist just because you father and daughter pair said so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This subject heard it with his own ears!” in response to Ning Xiaoyao’s words, a dozen or so voices chorused simultaneously before their owners knelt down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ning Xiaoyao. She was going to be beat up by the crowd at this rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Your Majesty blaming This Dowager</span><i><span style>?” </span></i><span style>Empress Dowager Xie covered her face and burst into tears. Her body trembled, and she looked on the verge of fainting away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao seized the chance to chase her off. “If you’re not feeling well, go back to the imperial harem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie fell until she was sitting on the steps to the throne. Ning Xiaoyao didn’t catch how she fell, but felt that her movements were inexorably beautiful, almost like someone dancing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Empress Dowager!” Grand Preceptor Xie shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie softly beat her chest as she sobbed. “This Dowager</span> <span style>would rather pass away like the late emperor right now. Your Majesty, This Dowager</span> <span style>is but a woman. Now that my husband’s dead, I defer to the son. Whatever Your Majesty wants This Dowager</span> <span style>to do, This Dowager</span> <span style>will do it. In the past, it was This Dowager</span> <span style>who did a disservice to Your Majesty and made you stay at the Grand Preceptor’s estate for over a decade without a chance to even see the late emperor. This is This Dowager’s</span> <span style>fault. Your Majesty, ah~” Empress Dowager Xie’s sobs were soft, but were still enough to tug at the heartstrings. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao viciously pinched herself on the leg. She wanted to cry too, because she could tell that the empress dowager was pretending to be pitiful in front of the ministers. Still, Ning Xiaoyao still couldn’t cry even after pinching herself multiple times. Pretending to be weak and weepy was one of her weak points!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie shot a glance at the place where the rest of the imperial clan was standing. These imperial sons and noblemen were currently just looking on, unconcerned. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty.” Within the Hall of Golden Chimes, an old but steady voice spoke up. Grand Preceptor Xie gave a start at the voice. Ning Xiaoyao looked over, and saw a white-haired, bearded old man around 70 years old. He was thin, and his bowed head made it impossible for Ning Xiaoyao to see his face. Instead, she felt guilty of committing a sin by accepting a kowtow from someone so old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have business?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man opened his mouth and said, “Your Majesty, acting this way is inappropriate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao dug her fingers into her palms. Here was another one of those opposed against her. Meanwhile, doubts plagued Grand Preceptor Xie’s heart. This Elder Li was one of the few remaining in the palace who could still oppose him. He had always praised himself for being the leader of the </span><i><span style>qingliu, </span></i><span style>or clear stream--those groups of scholars who were concerned with politics but held themselves aloof from those in power. Was he standing on the Grand Preceptor’s side today?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li bent forwards as he spoke out sternly with the force of justice. “Esteemed Empress Dowager is Your Majesty’s own mother. How could Your Majesty treat Esteemed Empress Dowager like so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li’s words suddenly cleared up Grand Preceptor Xie’s mind. What was the strongest weapon in their hands? Wasn’t it </span><i><span style>filial piety? </span></i><span style>Even if Ning Yu was the most noble Son of Heaven, she had no excuse pushing her mother to the point of pained tears in the great hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aye,” Grand Preceptor Xie sighed in a low voice. “His Majesty is still young. Elder Li, you cannot excoriate His Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li said, “A son should conduct himself with filial piety towards his mother. Does one need to look at age for this? Which sage taught it this way?” His first criticism against Ning Xiaoyao began to attract followers from the officials who took him as their teacher. Women of the imperial harem shouldn’t meddle in politics, but mistakes in filial piety weren’t permitted either. His Majesty had to conform to conventions in this case. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt like stamping her feet. By that logic, wouldn’t she have to kneel and beg the empress dowager to hold curtain from behind the curtains? And then have Grand Preceptor Xie squander the country for a dozen more years until more good people, more citizens died? All for the sake of a lying woman who didn’t cherish human life? Ning Xiaoyao wanted to speak sense to these people, but Elder Li’s faction were all </span><i><span style>qingliu </span></i><span style>who were learned scholars well-versed in literary Chinese, pedantic terms, and </span><i><span style>Confucius says </span></i><span style>quotes. They could crush Ning Xiaoyao until she was left speechless without an argument. How was she supposed to argue with them when she wouldn’t understand their words? （TOT）</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This subject asks that Esteemed Empress Dowager holds court from behind the curtain,” a member of the Grand Preceptor’s faction shouted as he knelt on the ground in the wake of Elder Li’s censure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty still isn’t inviting Esteemed Empress Dowager to rise?” Elder Li gave Ning Xiaoyao a disapproving look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Late emperor…” Empress Dowager Xie continued to cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“May Esteemed Empress Dowager hold court from behind the screen,” men from the Grand Preceptor’s faction continued to shout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao leapt up from the Dragon Throne. It looked like she couldn’t talk sense to anyone anymore. “Fine then,” she said loudly. “If Esteemed Empress Dowager holds court from behind the curtain today, </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>will abdicate tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her decisive statement stunned Empress Dowager Xie and the gathered ministers. Ning Xiaoyao stood from a commanding height as she looked at Empress Dowager Xie. </span><i><span style>Isn't your life goal to live a luxurious life as the empress dowager while holding court from behind the curtain? Then I won’t be the emperor anymore. I don’t want to play around with you, so what now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You,” Empress Dowager Xie was really shaking now, but from anger. </span><i><span style>Was this girl determined to fight her to the death? </span></i><span style>“Your Majesty, do you want to force This Dowager</span> <span style>until she dies?” she asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!” Elder Li was angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao waved a hand at the old man. “Don’t talk just yet, let </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>speak first. Filial piety, is it? Me letting Esteemed Empress Dowager work like a coolie to govern the throne and administer affairs of state is filial piety? Do you all know what true filial piety is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li said, “May Your Majesty instruct us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tomorrow, </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>will take the empress dowager to travel around the world,” Ning Xiaoyao pointed towards the outside of the palace. “When a person gets old, they should enjoy a happy life of ease and comfort!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ministers were all silent. </span><i><span style>Was the empress dowager really that old?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie, with her head full of black hair, only loathed the fact that Ning Xin was still too young. Right now, she couldn’t let Ning Xiaoyao die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These are </span><i><span style>Zhen’s </span></i><span style>words today. If nothing else works, </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>will abdicate,” Ning Xiaoyao was a completely clever hoodlum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li said, “Imperial power was bestowed by the Heavens. How could Your Majesty treat it as a game?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao replied, “Imperial power was bestowed by the Heavens? Hasn’t </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>been treated like a trained dog by everyone all the same? Do you even believe your own words?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could anything train the emperor like a dog?</span></i><span style> Elder Li fell to his knees. Ning Xiaoyao shifted to one side to avoid it. Having someone so old kneel to her was more than she deserved. Elder Li knocked his head against the floor and said, “This subject only tried, to the greatest extent, to present sincere advice. Sincere advice is often grating to the ears, the Sage said…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder one, that’s enough,” Ning Xiaoyao wanted to die as soon as she heard </span><i><span style>the Sage said. &nbsp;</span></i><span style>Sages said so many things, yet the world was still full of people who lived in worse state than dogs. </span><i><span style>(Author: Can you give it up with the dogs already?) </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li gave a start when he heard Ning Xiaoyao call him ‘</span><i><span style>elder one.’ </span></i><span style>Why would such a moniker show up in the Hall of Golden Chimes? Ning Xiaoyao had already worked up a sweat from her impatience. She reached out a hand and tugged at the collar of her dragon robes. These clothes looked distinguished and imposing, but was she allowed to say that she preferred pure cotton clothes instead? </span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Empress Dowager Xie saw Ning Xiaoyao tugging at her collar, she cried out, “Your Majesty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s hand stiffened in response. She lowered her head to peer at Empress Dowager Xie. Had she thought of another scheme to counter her again? Empress Dowager Xie stood up from the steps all by herself and faced the crowd of ministers. Grand Preceptor Xie’s expression shifted.</span><i><span style> What was his daughter planning to do? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie suddenly bent down on one knee to bow towards the crowd. When that happened, no one else besides Ning Xiaoyao dared to remain standing in the great hall. All the ministers fell to their knees in haste. Empress Dowager Xie spoke sorrowfully, “The late emperor passed away without His Majesty having a chance to see him once. After entering the palace, His Majesty cried himself bitterly into unconsciousness multiple times. If not for the rules of our forefathers, and the fact that today’s the date for a large assembly, then His Majesty would still be convalescing quietly in the imperial palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wanted to spit up blood. </span><i><span style>This woman could act and speak nonsense all too well!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty’s body is indisposed. As This Dowager</span> <span style>sees it, today’s large assembly should just end here,” Empress Dowager Xie continued. “His Majesty is filial, so there’s no way he wouldn’t obey the late emperor’s last will. Nothing more needs to be said. This Dowager</span> <span style>understands the bitterness in His Majesty’s heart, so I ask for your excellencies’ understanding towards His Majesty’s grief.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This subject solemnly obeys Esteemed Empress Dowager’s decree,” Grand Preceptor Xie led the way with a cry. Ning Xiaoyao looked dumbstruck at Empress Dowager Xie’s back. </span><i><span style>What did this mean? She was going to hold court from behind the screen just like that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Please rise,” Empress Dowager Xie raised her hand at the kneeling ministers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hold on, you,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “How come you’re the one issuing orders here now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie turned to face Ning Xiaoyao. “Someone come. Why aren’t you hurrying to send His Majesty back to the palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two eunuchs standing by the Dragon Throne answered in the affirmative before walking towards Ning Xiaoyao. Now she finally understood--the empress dowager wasn’t planning to argue with her, but had resorted to violence instead. The two eunuchs bowed as they reached Ning Xiaoyao and grabbed one of her hands on each side. Ning Xiaoyao chuckled as their hands touched. These two weren’t eunuchs at all! Their </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>androgen</span></a><span style> levels fell well within normal range in their bodies. </span><i><span style>Like hell they’re eunuchs!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie released a breath in relief as the two “eunuchs” grabbed hold of Ning Xiaoyao’s hands. He knew Ning Xiaoyao knew martial arts, so he hand chose these two experts from his own estate. They were there to keep Ning Xiaoyao at bay in case a scuffle broke out.</span></p>
