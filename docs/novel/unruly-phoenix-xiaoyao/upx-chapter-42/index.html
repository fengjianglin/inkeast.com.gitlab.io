 <p>Chapter 42: Piles of corpses at the empress dowager's palace&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui had a limited number of soldiers on hand, while the Grand Preceptor controlled the capital city, its surrounding environs, and the troops associated with both. Lou Zigui was clear in his heart that they couldn’t corner the Xie father and daughter like dogs to a wall until they jumped. There was no guarantee that they’d claim victory then. Ning Xiaoyao felt hurt. Leaving aside all her work and being lectured like a mutt, she’d even thrown away the Dragon Throne. Now she had to make good with the Xie father and mother and continue to act like family with them? </span><i><span style>Was there no end to this?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Lou Zigui said to Ning Xiaoyao. “How about you adjourn this court session?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was filled with reluctance but managed to mutter, “Adjourned.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said the people in the hall. </span><i><span style>Adjourned just like that? </span></i><span style>First there were quarrels, then people had died, then the great hall itself had been torn apart. Were things just going to end here? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui didn’t even spare the ministers a glance as he told Ning Xiaoyao, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lou Zigui,” Empress Dowager Xie saw them turning away and hastened to cry out, “Give Prince Cheng back to This Dowager</span><i><span style>.”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui jostled the baby in his arms a couple of times and replied, “Prince Cheng is His Majesty’s biological little brother. His Majesty is taking Prince Cheng to the imperial palace for a short rest, so Esteemed Empress Dowager can send someone to pick him up there.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You,” </span></i><span style>For the sake of protecting her son, Empress Dowager Xie was still willing to risk her life and defy Lou Zigui. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie half knelt down and patted Empress Dowager Xie’s hand. In a small voice, he said, “Nothing will happen to the prince. Empress Dowager need not worry, let them leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie stared at Ning Xiaoyao and said wretchedly, “He’s your own little brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. As if being of the same blood ever stopped anyone from killing each other. By now, Song Jin had found the eunuch in charge of announcements behind a pillar and brought him to the foot of the stairs leading to the throne.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you hear His Majesty say to adjourn the court?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This eunuch was shaking with fear as he opened his mouth and shouted, “Adjourned!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only after His Majesty left with Lou Zigui did the other members of the imperial clan speak up. “So the empress dowager won’t hold court from behind a screen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The puffy Prince Fu, Ning Guangshun, swayed his body as he tottered out of the palace and replied, “The Grand Preceptor’s even knelt to recognize his wrongs and said he misunderstood. How could Esteemed Empress Dowager hold court from behind any screen now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, then His Majesty won?” another relative asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu smiled coldly. It was nothing more than a dog biting another dog. Who cared about the losers or victors? </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aye,” Ning Xiaoyao carried a branch in her hand on the trip to the Imperial Palace, scratching it against the ground as she sighed. Right now, His Majesty Ning’s head was dizzy, and all she could think about was how nobody respected her position as emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lou Zigui heard Ning Xiaoyao’s sighs, he asked, “Your Majesty is unhappy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wore a bitter expression. “Is there anything worth being happy about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui arched an eyebrow. “The empress dowager couldn’t hold court from behind a screen. Isn’t Your Majesty happy about that?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hmm?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gave a start. </span><i><span style>That’s right, </span></i><span style>the empress dowager couldn’t hold court from behind a screen today. It should be the empress dowager who’s unhappy, right? Once she figured this out, Ning Xiaoyao grinned. As long as Empress Dowager Xie wasn’t happy, she was! Big Boss Black ran ahead to avoid her foolish grin. As a cat, he couldn’t stand how stupid it looked on her face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah,” Ning Xiaoyao tossed away the branch in her hands and turned towards Fang Tang and the rest. “I only just realized, we scored a victory today!” Why didn’t Fang Tang and the rest feel touched at all?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s eyes showed hints of laughter when he saw the melancholy Ning Xiaoyao suddenly turned bright and cheerful. Those who were easily satisfied were typically more simple and pure. Upon returning to the Imperial Palace, Ning Xiaoyao stood on tiptoe to look at the child in Lou Zigui’s arms again. Though she’d wanted to kill Empress Dowager Xie from the first second she met her, Ning Xiaoyao had no such thoughts toward Ning Xin. It was senseless to shout and fight against an infant, wasn’t it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Lou Zigui handed the baby over to Song Jin and simply said, “Take it out of the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao was floored again. “You want to send him away?” </span><i><span style>Wouldn’t Empress Dowager Xie go crazy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked at Ning Xiaoyao’s large, dark eyes and suddenly smiled. “Your Majesty, this isn’t Prince Cheng.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whaa?” Ning Xiaoyao was still stunned. </span><i><span style>This wasn’t Ning Xin? </span></i><span style>Then they’d cheated their way against the Xie father and daughter pair? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui waved a hand at Song Jin, who awkwardly held onto the babe and bowed to Ning Xiaoyao. Then his large strides took him out of the great hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not preparing to hurt Prince Cheng,” Lou Zigui told Ning Xiaoyao. “In that case, it doesn’t matter whose child I carried into the Hall of Golden Chimes, because the effects were all the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about that charm?” Ning Xiaoyao still remembered how pained she felt over the broken jade charm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That was real. It was taken from the empress dowager’s palace.” Lou Zigui sat down and looked at Ning Xiaoyao. “Without that charm, how could we have convinced the Xie father and daughter that the baby was Prince Cheng?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not it,” Ning Xiaoyao was a little confused from being run around circles by Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou. “If you could take the charm out, why not take Prince Cheng directly as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Believe me,” Lou Zigui replied, “When the Xie father and mother return to the empress dowager’s palace and see Prince Cheng, they’ll be even more alarmed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao couldn’t manage any more questions, so she turned to look at the dumbfounded Fang Tang. “Do you have trouble understanding him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang nodded. Now that she had a companion, Ning Xiaoyao stopped worrying about her IQ. She nodded in turn. “I didn’t understand it either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou rested a hand on his forehead. The other generals looked at the two figures standing in solidarity. Were they uniting under their stupidity? (</span><i><span style>Author: Can’t you guys treat His Majesty with a bit more respect?</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and take care of the matter with the imperial guards,” Lou Zigui told the generals under his command. “Get rid of the ones we can’t keep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The generals accepted their orders and withdrew. Ning Xiaoyao asked weakly, “Are we discharging the ones we can’t keep?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang felt a sudden sense of superiority then. </span><i><span style>He wasn’t the stupidest one! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui glanced at Fang Tang and said, “You’re still standing here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang ran out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Lou Zigui said after the man had gone. “Since those men only obey the empress dowager and Grand Preceptor’s commands, what’s the use of leaving them by Your Majesty’s side?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh, then they’re getting discharged. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her nose and said, “Then we won’t have them. Let’s do some major recruiting. There are so many refugees in the streets, so won’t it be simple to get some to do the work of imperial guards?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Lou Zigui. It seemed that this person didn’t understand a thing about imperial guards, either. (</span><i><span style>Author: Supreme Commander, you’re wrong. This person doesn’t understand a thing about this world, period. </span></i><span style>&nbsp;o(╯□╰)o )</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whose baby was that?” Ning Xiaoyao asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A colleague’s grandson,” Lou Zigui answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Ning Xiaoyao released a breath. As long as they hadn’t bought off someone, it was all good. After asking all the available questions, the room fell into silence between the sitting and standing pair. Her large eyes stared at his small ones for a while before Ning Xiaoyao asked, “Are you hungry?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou didn’t get to speak before Big Boss Black couldn’t take it anymore and cried, “You ninny, do you only know how to eat?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao lifted up Big Boss Black and threw him out the window. </span><i><span style>Didn’t he promise to stop calling her a ninny once she restored </span></i><em><span style>Supreme Commander’s</span></em><i><span style> innocence? </span></i><span style>This fat black furball wasn’t trustworthy at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” a palace maid reported after Big Boss Black fell out the window. “Elder Li begs for an audience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as she heard it was that old man, Ning Xiaoyao trembled. The old grandpa wasn’t going to let her off?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go tell Elder Li,” Lou Zigui said, “His Majesty’s feeling unwell and gone to rest. If Elder Li has any business, he can say it at the small assembly two days later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though the palace maid was unable to get Ning Xiaoyao’s words, she replied in the affirmative and left with Lou Zigui’s answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speaking of which, exactly what kind of official is that elder?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “Is he higher than the Grand Preceptor, or lower?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui furrowed his eyebrows at the question. It looked like there was plenty of things for His Majesty to learn. Meanwhile, Ning Xiaoyao glanced at herself, then at Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou, and asked, “Huh? How come I have to stand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui fell silent. </span><i><span style>Who knew?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, that’s right,” Ning Xiaoyao slapped her forehead again. “I need to go back to the Hall of Golden Chimes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For what?” Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve seen the Dragon Throne, it’s not pure gold,” Ning Xiaoyao said seriously. “But the outside layer of gold plating is worth a lot of money if I scrape it off. I’m going to carry it back."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You,” </span></i><span style>Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou found it difficult to form words as he replied, “Do you know the significance of the Dragon Throne?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao tilted her head in thought. Not understanding, she replied, “Isn’t it just a chair?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s the</span><i><span style> Dragon Throne</span></i><span style>,” Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou stressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I didn’t change into a dragon,” Ning Xiaoyao said disdainfully. “What’s the use of sitting on a Dragon Throne? Didn’t that grandpa Li lecture me like a dog all the same?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Li scolded you?” Lou Zigui’s gaze turned heavy. Ning Xiaoyao shrugged her shoulders and sat next to Lou Zigui. She took a pastry from the dish on a table and placed it in Lou Zigui’s hand before getting one for herself and eating half of it in one bite. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know for sure if he was scolding me, but he looked pretty emotional when he was talking. Almost like he wanted to bite me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t understand anything,” Ning Xiaoyao rolled her eyes. Lou Zigui fell silent. </span><i><span style>If Elder Li heard His Majesty’s words, maybe he’d feel like dying?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh, Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>are you hungry?” Ning Xiaoyao asked again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked at the pastry in his hand. </span><i><span style>Did they have to change topics to food?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black ran out of the Imperial Palace. After going with Supreme Commander</span> <span style>to the Hall of Golden Chimes, he had to show off in front of his fellow brothers. But before he found them, he heard a few gray pigeons fly overhead and speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A lot of people’s died at the empress dowager’s palace, </span><i><span style>coo coo.”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, </span><i><span style>coo coo, &nbsp;</span></i><span style>it’s frightening. Let’s not go see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black turned blank. He changed directions to run towards the empress dowager’s palace instead. </span><i><span style>How could there be lots of dead people?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie was carried over to her palace on a sedan chair, but there was no sound of anyone once the doors were opened. Only the caws of crows filled the air, along with a stench of blood that made her want to throw up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At the very least, Prince Cheng is unharmed.” the Grand Preceptor didn’t think there was anyone living left at the empress dowager’s palace. These were the only words he could say to calm down his eldest daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How, how could this be?” Empress Dowager Xie’s voice trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dragon Guards,” Grand Preceptor Xie said in a low voice. “Most of the imperial guards went to the assembly hall, so the ones remaining here were no match for them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sedan chair arrived at the main doors. Beyond them was a pile of corpses, upon which carrion-eating crow tits were hopping back and forth in search of food. Two severed pieces of intestines had been picked out of a body and lay across the threshold. It was now completely covered in flies. Empress Dowager Xie’s hands clenched with a death grip around the handlebars of the sedan chair to avoid falling out of her seat entirely. Still, she couldn’t hold back the wave of nausea. As soon as she opened her mouth, it was to vomit.</span></p>
