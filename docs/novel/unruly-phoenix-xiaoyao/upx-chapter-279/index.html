 <p><span style>Chapter 279: Supreme Commander Lou arranges an escape route</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Lou Zigui was the one who snatched her noodles, Ning Xiaoyao decided to hold back. </span><i><span style>Snatching my food? Humph! I’ll endure it for now. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She waited until after Lou Zigui left to deal with the war affairs before she ran to the kitchen to gobble up the rest of the noodles from the pot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang was a spectator from the beginning to the end. Ultimately, he was so terrified that he ran to get a digestion pill from Imperial Physician Gao. He was prepared to give His Majesty the pill in case he fell ill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, because Chef Huang was so traumatized by what he saw, he decided to eat something to alleviate his stress. Unfortunately, Chef Huang resulted in overeating and had to take the pill for himself. So, Physician Gao’s secret recipe pill ended up in Chef Huang’s stomach and never got to Ning Xiaoyao’s mouth. （o(╯□╰)o）</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui was completely oblivious he had narrowly missed a beating from Ning Xiaoyao. He was so busy the next few days that he practically didn’t see her at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Likewise, Ning Xiaoyao kept herself busy as well. She helped Erya and Xiaoqiu pack their bags and ordered Shadowgale to send the two siblings out of the palace. “Also, don’t forget to bring the Xie Clan’s fifth young miss. Send her as far as you can. We’re about to go to war and the lady doesn’t know martial arts! How would she protect herself ah?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ning Xiaoyao mentioned Xie Duoying, Shadowgale felt slightly uncomfortable. But after giving it some thought, he couldn’t think of a reason not to help her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go now.” Ning Xiaoyao patted Shadowgale on the shoulder. “Since you’ve decided to like someone, then like you must.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale made a salute. “I understand.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ning Xiaoyao had finished convincing Windy, she turned to the sobbing Erya. Erya was refusing to leave. “Erya, Xiaoqiu is the only son and heir of your family! What if something happens to him?” Ning Xiaoyao reasoned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erya cried, “Then just send him alone!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what if something happens to you?” Ning Xiaoyao picked up Xiaoqiu and pushed him into Shadowgale’s arms. Currently, Xiaoqiu had tears and snots streaming down his face. “Who will take care of Xiaoqiu then? During the battle, I’ll be risking my life on the front-line. I wouldn’t be able to take care of you two. Erya, help lessen my worries, alright?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Erya was silenced by Ning Xiaoyao’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good girl,” Ning Xiaoyao stuffed a purse into Erya’s lapel. “Take good care of Xiaoqiu. I’ll be fine. Don’t cry!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Make sure you come get us afterwards.” Erya wiped her tears and requested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm. After we’re finished here, I’ll come pick you both up.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>After Erya received Ning Xiaoyao’s promise, she reluctantly left with Shadowgale. She was still sobbing and sniffling. As for Xiaoqiu, he was desperately twisting and turning his body like a fried dough twist to break out of Shadowgale’s grip. He shrieked, “I don’t want to leave!” But how could a small figure like himself compete against one of the great commanders of the Dragon Guards? Xiaoqiu tried his best to resist, but was taken away by Shadowgale nonetheless. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stood by the courtyard gate. Xiaoqiu’s cries caused her to sniff and wipe her eyes. Deep down, she wanted to toss Grand Preceptor Xie to a horde of zombies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Ning Xiaoyao was grieving at the courtyard gate, Lou Zigui was sitting and listening to the Lord Protector. They were in one of the palace rooms where the Lord Protector was temporarily residing in. “Xie Wenyuan’s people left the capital to Anyuan. Supreme Commander, since you warned us not to beat the grass and startle the snake, my people didn’t touch him.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui nodded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there any news from Fang Tang?” asked the Lord Protector. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“None,” replied Lou Zigui, “Xie Wenyuan’s people are probably already keeping an eye on the road between the capital and Anyuan. Even if my men were to send us a message, it probably won’t get to us.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector anxiously wiped his forehead. “My men have also gone to Anyuan. But based on what they have sent back, the Black Frost Cavalry shouldn’t have entered the capital.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked at him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“My point is, are we sending His Majesty out of the capital? During the actual battle, our numbers are at a disadvantage. If an accident occurs, it may be too late to regret.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui paused for a moment before speaking. “What are your plans for the Old Madam and your other family members?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector immediately turned distress. “My old mother says she isn’t going anywhere. She only allowed me to send the little ones out.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui was surprised. “She won’t leave?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” said the Lord Protector, “My mother said if we lose, she will go find Xie Wenyuan to die together.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Old Madam have to step in, then we’re truly too useless.” Lou Zigui shook his head. “I’m sure His Majesty is unwilling to leave as well.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector sighed. </span><i><span style>It feels like he’s used up his entire quota of sighs in this lifetime. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to send His Majesty down south,” Lou Zigui lowered his voice. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector immediately reacted. “Are you thinking of sending His Majesty to the navy in Jiangnan? To find Qin Xuan?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If we lose, Qin Xuan can guard His Majesty out to the sea.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s words caused Lord Protector to feel a chill down in his heart. </span><i><span style>Lou Zigui is already thinking of an escape route for His Majesty after their deaths. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and tell the Old Madam that His Majesty needs people to take care of him. We will be on the front-line fighting, so aside from her, there isn’t anyone else I can think of right now to watch over His Majesty.” Lou Zigui instructed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector was hesitant. “My old mother can take care of His Majesty?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Obviously she can’t.” Lou Zigui coldly replied. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector felt as if he had been slapped across the face by Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>His face hurts! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“With the Old Madam around, even if His Majesty hears of our defeat and death, he will look after those alive first. He won’t return here to die.” Lou Zigui explained. “Lord Protector, as long as His Majesty is here, the Old Madam, your wife and children will be fine.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector heaved a deep sigh. “I see.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Lou Zigui will hand the responsibility of caring for his old mother and family members to His Majesty. His Majesty isn’t the type that would abandon the old and young. Even if they are met with a mishap, His Majesty won’t come back to die. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“We won’t necessarily get to that point,” Lou Zigui offered a smile. “This is the worst case scenario.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector stood up and cupped his fist. He said he understood and left. Although it may be the worst case scenario, Lord Protector felt like his heart was going to break the moment he imagined all of them dead in battle, the emperor protecting the old and young on his own to Jiangnan, and ultimately being forced to take refuge in the sea by Xie Wenyuan. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lord Protector left, Lou Zigui raised his hand to stroke Big Boss Black. Big Boss Black was crouching on the table. Lately, the black cat had been following him everywhere. As a result, Lou Zigui was used to having the fat cat as his company. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miaow!” Big Boss Black called out to Lou Zigui, “Supreme Commander, if you die, Xiaoyao would be very sad! Miaow!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“From now on, be good and stay by her side.” Lou Zigui patted Big Boss Black’s head and whispered. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black wanted to cry. </span><i><span style>What’s the use of accompanying that ninny? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-----</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the Lord Protector was walking out of the palace gate in a daze, Pei Yan and another man dismounted from their horses. When Pei Yan saw his elder brother, his brows crinkled. “What’s wrong with you? You just cried?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector rubbed his eyes and denied. “Why would I cry? Sand got in my eyes.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The corner of Pei Yan’s mouth twitched. </span><i><span style>His lie may be good enough to fool a child. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector observed the man that stood behind Pei Yan. He was wearing a wide-brimmed hat that concealed everything but the chin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Xu Jichang” Pei Yan spoke in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector’s eyes immediately widened. </span><i><span style>Xu Jichang was Xu Jing’s eldest son. The Xu Clan has finally arrived to the capital! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Please,” Pei Yan stood sideways and gestured the young man to enter the palace. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Jichang slightly nodded at the Lord Protector as a greeting. Then, he followed Pei Yan to the small palace gate. There was no hesitation from Lord Protector at all. He quickly followed behind Xu Jichang. He wanted to hear the talk between Lou Zigui and Xu Jichang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stood in the corridor waiting for Xu Jichang. Since they were unfamiliar with each other, they cupped their fists as a greeting. Lou Zigui commented, “Your journey must have been exhausting.” Xu Jichang replied, “Supreme Commander, you’re too courteous.” That was the end of the polite exchange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan wanted to speak, but the Lord Protector pulled him back. </span><i><span style>The moment his brother opens his mouth, he will offend someone! Right now, those from the Xu Clan is the boss! They cannot afford to offend anyone!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go in and talk.” Lou Zigui invited Xu Jichang in. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Xu Jichang replied, “Supreme Commander Lou, I would like to see His Majesty.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll have to wait until His Majesty summons you. His Majesty is the country’s ruler. He doesn’t see just anyone. Just because you want to see him doesn’t mean he will see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Jichang: ...</span><i><span style>he’s trying to show off his dominance now? Isn’t it a bit of a rush?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector was nervous for Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>Can you speak in a nicer tone to the Xu Clan? Whatever issues you have, deal with it after we get rid of Xie Wenyuan please!?! After we get rid of Xie Wenyuan, you can torment the Xu Clan whichever way you like! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve sent people to pick up Chen Lu and his wife. If Eldest Master doesn’t want to speak inside, then we’ll speak out here in the courtyard.” Lou Zigui curtly stated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I could go to the Chen Estate.” Xu Jichang coldly retaliated. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Wenyuan has eyes in and out of the Chen Estate. Are you sure you want to go there, Eldest Master?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I could say that I came to the capital under my esteemed father’s command to see the Grand Preceptor first.” said Xu Jichang. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“But you’re already in the palace. Eldest Master, could it be that you’ll say I forcefully dragged you here?” Lord Protector didn’t have to look to know it was Pei Yan who spoke up. </span><span style>Fury flashed across Xu Jichang’s face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this the time to show arrogance?” Pei Yan jeered. “Do you think His Majesty is begging your Xu Clan?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Jichang sneered, “Who dares to let His Majesty beg?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t tell what you’re actually doing?” Pei Yan retorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector braced himself and dragged Pei Yan behind him again. </span><i><span style>It’s a miracle those two didn’t fight on their way here. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s focus on the matter at hand.” The Lord Protector spoke as a peacemaker. “Right now is not the time to bicker. Supreme Commander, Elder Master, let’s focus on the matter instead.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander Lou, are you acting as the regent for the monarch? Are your words equivalent to the Emperor?” Xu Jichang asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Emperor is here!” Ning XIaoyao’s voice rang from outside the courtyard gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector breathed a sigh of relief. </span><i><span style>They’re saved</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s face turned dark. He had ordered his subordinates not to let Miss Ning see Xu Jichang at the very beginning. He wanted to avoid the misconception that His Majesty was begging the Xu Clan for help. </span><i><span style>Who’s the damn snitch?</span></i><span style> (</span><i><span style>Author: That’d be the fat, black cat next to you…</span></i><span style>) &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Jichang turned around.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ning Xiaoyao slipped through the courtyard door and entered. Despite wearing the dragon robe, she still didn’t look like an emperor. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your subject, Xu Jichang, greets His Majesty. May the emperor live on for tens of thousands of years.” Eldest Master Xu got down on his knees. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was about to reach out her hand to pull him up, but Lou Zigui coughed on the side. So, she withdrew her hand and order Xu Jichang to get up. “Rise. At this point, who knows who’ll be the emperor? Hahaha!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Jichang:... </span><i><span style>you can still laugh so happily even though you might lose your throne? </span></i></p>
