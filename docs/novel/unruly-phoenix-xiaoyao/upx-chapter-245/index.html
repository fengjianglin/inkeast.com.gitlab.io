 <p><span style>“It’s nothing that serious,” Ning Xiaoyao told Imperial Physician Gao. “Why would I kill my own mother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao just stared at her. </span><i><span style>So you </span></i><b><i>do </i></b><i><span style>realize the empress dowager’s your mother.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s just that the empress dowager has never viewed me as her daugh---as her son, that’s all,” Ning Xiaoyao added. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao fell silent again. </span><i><span style>That’s true, too.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain soon ran back with a gust of wind and gave Ning Xiaoyao two bags of sugar beans. “Your Majesty, are two bags enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded, before tossing one promptly in her mouth. As she munched on the candy, she remarked, “Eating too many sweets is bad for your teeth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty is right,” Shadowrain agreed. “Your Majesty is wise and brilliant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao stared at Ning Xiaoyao’s mouthful of sugar bean and didn’t feel like saying a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, can I go to the empress dowager’s palace?” Shadowrain asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm, go ahead,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded again. “Tell Windy and the others that I’m alright so they don’t need to worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain muttered an assent and ran back out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, then this subject?” Imperial Physician Gao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at him. “What should we do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This subject doesn’t know,” Imperial Physician Gao replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aye,” Ning Xiaoyao sighed. “I don’t, either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao just stared at her again. </span><i><span style>Right now, I just want a place by myself to think a bit.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Ning Xiaoyao suddenly remembered, “Supreme Commander said he’d fetch water for my bath.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao leveled a calm stare at Ning Xiaoyao as he reminded her, “Your Majesty, Supreme Commander’s already left for the empress dowager’s palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stared back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao had no choice but to ask, “Shall this subject fetch water for Your Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t even rely on Supreme Commander, so how could I rely on you?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao immediately felt like leaving again. Ning Xiaoyao swayed her way off the bed and said, “Forget it. Nowadays, it’s better to rely on yourself, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, you’re still supposed to be faking your death,” Imperial Physician Gao pointed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s glare turned vicious. “So just because I’m ‘dead,’ I can’t even leave my room?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao braced himself as he intoned, “What if a spy sees Your Majesty looking perfectly well? That wouldn’t be good, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s what I just said. Now you’re using my words against me?” Ning Xiaoyao’s gaze sharpened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Imperial Physician Gao. </span><i><span style>You were worrying about spies just a minute ago, but now you don’t care anymore?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I,” Ning Xiaoyao began, before her expression suddenly shifted. The next second she had fallen back on the bed and told the stunned doctor, “Quick, someone’s coming. Little Gao, hurry and pretend you’re heartbroken.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao’s head darted around the imperial bedchambers, seeing nothing but stillness in the room.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Hurry up,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao was left at a loss by her urgency. “W-what should this subject do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pretend I’m your father! “ Ning Xiaoyao hissed. “And that I’m dying!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Imperial Physician Gao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ning Xiaoyao heard noises coming from outside the window, she shut her eyes and lay stiffly on the bed, pretending she was dead. Imperial Physician Gao nudged the bags of sugar beans under the covers before kneeling by the bedside and began to imagine his father dying…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A rather short eunuch appeared outside the window on the right, holding a broom in his hand. He lightly pushed against the window. Catching the minute change of light seeping in through its crack, Imperial Physician Gao immediately dropped his head and broke into quiet sobs. With a mournful cry, he exclaimed, </span><i><span style>“Your Majesty!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt goosebumps on her skin. As she lay there like a corpse, she couldn’t help but marvel at the fact that Imperial Physician Gao was really treating her like his dead dad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s there?” a Dragon Guard soon appeared by the window and soundly boxed the eunuch by his ears. Imperial Physician Gao immediately shut up and ran towards the window. There, he saw the eunuch sprawled on the ground, a trickle of blood coming out of his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who let you in here?” the Dragon Guard came forward and placed his foot over the eunuch’s chest, voice cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao moved to shut the window before demanding, “Who is it?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eunuch was trembling in fear as he pointed at the broom in his hand. The Dragon Guard knitted his brows before replying, “Someone on clean up duty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chase him off!” Imperial Physician Gao’s voice was hoarse from obvious crying. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scram!” the Dragon Guard kicked the eunuch, who rolled on the ground before crawling to his feet and fleeing with the broom in his arms. “He’s gone,” he added after the eunuch had vanished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao returned to the bed. Ning Xiaoyao was tossing another sugar bean into her mouth. “See that? What did I say? There are spies in Supreme Splendor Hall.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao sat quietly on the stool by her bed, and Ning Xiaoyao offered him a few sugar beans as well. “Eat. This world is pretty savage, isn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao silently ate the beans. </span><i><span style>Yes, this world is plenty savage.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sighed. </span><i><span style>Forget about baths. </span></i><span style>She got off the bed and prepared to change her clothes instead. Imperial Physician Gao saw her digging through her wardrobe and asked, “Your Majesty, shall this subject help you change clothes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glanced at him. “That’s the job of concubines or eunuchs. Little Gao, you still want to do it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao fell silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao carried a bundle of clean clothes behind a folding screen and began to change as she talked. “Say, how do you think Supreme Commander’s doing over there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao thought it over before replying, “If he gets physical, Supreme Commander won’t lose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stiffened in the middle of taking off her robes. </span><i><span style>Supreme Commander getting physical with the empress dowager? Is that possible?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Empress Dowager Xie was sitting in her bedroom at the empress dowager’s palace with a </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>cradling Ning Xin standing by her side. Both mistress and servant were ashen faced and nearly scared out of their wits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The empress was shouting that His Majesty died?” Empress Dowager Xie asked the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>couldn’t say anything beyond nodding her head. Empress Dowager Xie felt her whole body turn cold as she sat there blankly. Then she muttered to herself, “Née Zhou wouldn’t </span><i><span style>dare. </span></i><span style>How could that slut have the guts to kill His Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Weren’t you the one who gave her the guts in the first place? </span></i><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>looked at Empress Dowager Xie but kept her thoughts to herself. She tried to comfort her next, but no words came out from her trembling lips. A team of imperial guards had long surrounded their palace. Occasionally, the sobs of an errant court lady or eunuch would reach their ears between the flurry of guards’ boots running through the building. They would upbraid the servants for making noise, their loud voices passing through the shut doors and windows. Empress Dowager Xie could only listen dazedly as they talked. Lou Zigui had suddenly brought an entire contingent of imperial guards into her palace, completely taking her by surprise. Before she could recover, she’d been trapped in the inner chambers of her bedroom. As time trickled by, Empress Dowager Xie suddenly sprang to her feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>gave a start. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie’s face was turning green as she grit her teeth. “Née Zhou only went to Supreme Splendor Hall today. If His Majesty took the drugs, they wouldn’t have reacted so quickly.” Her face seemed to contort at the thought, badly scaring the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>who backed away with Ning Xin in her arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring her servant, the empress dowager said, “Née Zhou didn’t use the drugs on His Majesty at all. She must have conspired with him to accuse This Dowager of plotting against the emperor. Ning Yu wants This Dowager dead. That bastard actually wants me dead?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>grew even more fearful at Empress Dowager Xie’s words. She held on tightly to Ning Xin as if he was her last life-saving straw. Because her grip was too tight, Ning Xin woke up from his nap and burst into tears. Hearing him wail, the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>narrowly dropped the baby in her arms. But his sobs calmed Empress Dowager Xie down. She reached out to hold him before remembering that she was still ill. It’d be bad to infect her son as well, so she chided the </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>“Why haven’t you set His Highness down to comfort him yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>quickly ran to the bed and carefully set Ning Xin on its surface. She knelt by his side and began to coax the baby. Empress Dowager Xie stared at her son before deciding she couldn’t wait any longer. She had to change the situation to her favor. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside the building, Lou Zigui entered the courtyard and was met with Shadowgale, who murmured, “Esteemed Empress Dowager has been inside the whole time. She hasn’t come out or said a word.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Lou Zigui murmured back, his icy eyes sweeping over the court ladies and eunuchs kneeling on the ground. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of these are the servants who wait on Esteemed Empress Dowager in her quarters,” Shadowgale explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take them away,” Lou Zigui said simply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale nodded before turning to bark orders. “Take all them to the Hall of Punishment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The servants broke into sobs and screams as soon as they heard those words. One eunuch even wanted to run up the steps and into the building, but an imperial guard caught up to him and kicked him to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Empress Dowager!” the eunuch tried to shout, but more imperial guards drew in and hit and beat him until he fell unconscious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you, be quiet!” one of the imperial guard captains shouted. The sobs stopped momentarily before starting up again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Make them shut up,” Shadowgale said coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An imperial guard stepped forward with his sword still in its sheath and smacked the loudest crying </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>on the face. Blood burst from the wound as she tumbled backwards and lay still, out cold. The other guards prepared to follow suit, but the servants all fell silent when they saw them move. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, someone pounded on the door. Lou Zigui looked towards the building, where a few successive knocks sounded loudly. Nobody moved to open the doors, but Empress Dowager Xie was standing right on the other side. Lou Zigui signaled the two imperial guards standing by the door, who quickly opened it up for the woman. Because Empress Dowager Xie was </span><i><span style>still </span></i><span style>healing from her broken leg, she could only hobble her way over the threshold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The imperial guards saw that Lou Zigui didn’t bow or pay her any respects, so they simply stood there unmoving. Empress Dowager Xie reached the covered walkway before demanding from Lou Zigui, “Where is His Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui replied, “His Majesty was attacked by an assassin and injured. This subject and the rest are currently hunting down the assassin. Empress Dowager, that killer was from your palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie’s nail sheaths dug into the palms of her hands. She sucked in a deep breath and cried, “Where is your proof?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We haven’t interrogated the assassin yet,” Lou Zigui replied. “Once we get some results, this subject will tell Empress Dowager right away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the empress dowager’s palace,” Empress Dowager Xie replied. “Lou Zigui, you’re an outer official. How could you bring troops with you into the empress dowager’s quarters? Who gave you the gall?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui bow slightly towards her before he said, “This is a matter of utmost urgency that related to His Majesty’s safety. May Esteemed Empress Dowager pardon this subject for charging in with soldiers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the </span><i><span style>empress dowager’s palace!” </span></i><span style>Empress Dowager Xie raised her voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s voice was as cold as ever. “For the sake of His Majesty, this subject is willing to charge through all nine gates of Heaven to the celestial palace itself, to say nothing of this palace.”</span></p>
