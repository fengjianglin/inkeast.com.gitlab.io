 <p><span style>“Next, you can tell me about these farmers raising a righteous army thing,” Ning Xiaoyao said with a serious face after she finished laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Raising a righteous army?” Lou Zigui echoed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I mean the roving rebel bands,” Ning Xiaoyao elaborated. “Supreme Commander, so you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rested a hand against his forehead. </span><i><span style>When did I start understanding anything?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not sure why, either?” Ning Xiaoyao asked when he didn’t speak. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui sat a little closer to Ning Xiaoyao and said, “I’ve told you about the refugees before.” It was time for Supreme Commander Lou to start lessons for Ning Xiaoyao again. This time, they would learn exactly what ‘roving rebel bands’ were. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside the rooms, Fang Tang was have a staring contest with Imperial Physician Gao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve completely recovered?” Imperial Physician Gao was rubbing his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Completely,” Fang Tang replied. “His Majesty’s master’s secret arts did it. If His Majesty was a doctor, then all of you imperial physicians could retire to plant fields at home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Imperial Physician Gao. </span><i><span style>Doesn’t this man ever think before he speaks?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang stomped his right leg a few times in front of Imperial Physician Gao, who immediately knelt down and said, “Let me look at your wound.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang was quite generous. “Look as you will.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao examined Fang Tang’s two injuries over and over again for almost an entire hour before Fang Tang grew impatient. Finally, the doctor muttered to himself, “This is impossible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang fell silent. </span><i><span style>This is all he has to saw after looking at me for so long? He’s hopeless. He can’t even tell what’s up! This doctor’s nothing compared to His Majesty. </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Your Majesty is using her supernormal abilities…</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the palace, Ning Xiaoyao was rubbing her chin in thought. “Mm, I understand now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you understand?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao jumped off the bed to standing in front of him. “Rebel bands are organized groups of refugees who are armed with weapons. They’re simply raising a revolt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui creased his brows. “Rebel bands </span><i><span style>are </span></i><span style>traitors who rebelled. You didn’t know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was quite bold and self-assured. “You didn’t tell me that before, ah. Neither did you mention that their big boss’s made it his duty to kill me!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Do I need to explain such things? </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui stared at Ning Xiaoyao as he grew speechless once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be afraid,” Ning Xiaoyao waved a hand. “I have ways to deal with their big boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you even mean by big boss… Forget it,” Lou Zigui rested another hand against his forehead. “Tell me then, how do you plan to deal with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao bent down until her mouth was by Lou Zigui’s ear, then murmured, “He doesn’t know I’m actually a girl, oh~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui didn’t understand her words. “So then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So if he really does bring his troops into the capital, I’ll take off these dragon robes,” Ning Xiaoyao said smugly. “And put on a dress. Could the big boss realize that I’m the emperor then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s body shifted to the side and nearly sent him toppling off the chair. This wasn’t an idea that everyone could come up with. “You,” he straightened up and continued, “You’re prepared to give up your kingdom?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not giving it, I just can’t defeat them by that point,” Ning Xiaoyao corrected. “If I could, then that big boss would never manage to lead his troops to the capital, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was some logic to those words, so Lou Zigui was once again struck speechless. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“So roving rebel bands are made up of refugees,” Ning Xiaoyao remarked as she began pacing in circles around the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “No matter how capable Tao Yu is about fighting, he still needs the local military officers’ support. Moreover, he has to bring the troops over the location. As to where we’re transferring them from---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme Commander, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao suddenly halted. “Do as you see fit for these things. I’m going to discuss life with my uncle, Prince Fu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui felt a headache coming on. “You’re going to find Prince Fu---”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Slam! </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao had already gone out the door. Soon afterwards, Fang Tang carefully stuck his head inside. “Supreme Commander, where did His Majesty go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!” Lou Zigui snapped at him. Fang Tang quickly withdrew his head and looked back at the blank-faced Imperial Physician Gao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong with my Supreme Commander?” he asked in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao was still staring into space, lost in his own little world. He didn’t pay Fang Tang any attention. With everyone around him acting strangely, Fang Tang didn’t know what to do. When the door behind him slammed again, he turned quickly to catch Lou Zigui walking out of the room. Fang Tang quickly caught up behind him, but kept his mouth shut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stay in the palace and don’t go out,” Lou Zigui urged him. “You can leave the capital after I finish the arrangements with Prince Zhi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang nodded. “Then what are you doing now, Supreme Commander?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I still have things to take care of,” Lou Zigui lightly patted Fang Tang’s shoulders before descending the steps leading to the courtyard. He had brought the Pei brothers and Tao Yu back with him, so he couldn’t leave them waiting. They still had to discuss how to transfer the troops. Lou Zigui felt like his work would never end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey,” Fang Tang jabbed at Imperial Physician Gao with a finger once he saw that Lou Zigui was gone. “Say something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao stared blankly into the distance. Seeing this, Fang Tang had no choice but to go back inside and lie down. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao reached the Hall of Punishments just as Prince Fu was taking his strolls around the courtyard. If Ning Xiaoyao hadn’t checked his bone structure first, she never would’ve recognized the man. Who was this handsome old uncle? </span><i></i><span style>( ⊙ o ⊙ ) &nbsp;</span><i></i><span style>As soon as Prince Fu saw Ning Xiaoyao, his satisfied expression took on a gloomy look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We servants greet Your Majesty,” the various eunuchs in the courtyard fell on their knees. Despite his reluctance, Prince Fu had to join them in paying respects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need,” Ning Xiaoyao said cheerfully with a wave. “Everyone can get up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu immediately stopped kneeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go out and take a walk,” Ning Xiaoyao told the eunuchs. “I’m going to talk with my uncle a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eunuchs hurried away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao called out to Prince Fu, who only rolled his eyes at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This subject doesn’t dare. Is Your Majesty planning to let this subject go?” Even though he didn’t have to spend all days in his cell now, it was still abuse to keep him trapped in this courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sat down on a stone stool and replied, “Come sit, uncle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu stood there unmoving, his voice cold. “What has Your Majesty found this subject for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao examined Prince Fu from head to toe. “My God, so this is what you actually look like, ah, uncle. Look at you! Now that you’re skinnier, you look more human now. So handsome!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>(#‵′)凸, thought Prince Fu. </span><i><span style>Did I </span></i><b><i>not </i></b><i><span style>look human before?! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sit,” Ning Xiaoyao patted the empty stool before her. “Let’s have a talk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu walked to Ning Xiaoyao’s side but still didn’t sit. “If Your Majesty has something to say, why not say it outright? This subject has nothing more to give Your Majesty anymore. That’s right, this subject still wants to ask Your Majesty, when is this subject getting my official salary?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao blinked. “As long as you don’t mention the salary, we can still stay a good uncle and nephew pair.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu really wanted to beat that wretch to death. </span><i><span style>Who wants to be a good uncle to you?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it, it’s fine if you don’t sit too,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “I came because I have bad news.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu stared down Ning Xiaoyao as if facing his worst enemy. “What did you do this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao took out the emergency missive from her pocket and stuffed it into Prince Fu’s hands. “Uncle, have a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu accepted the papers doubtfully. Ning Xiaoyao stuffed a sugar bean into her mouth. Meanwhile, Big Boss Black had slipped in out of nowhere and jumped into her lap before settling down. As Ning Xiaoyao petted his head, she conjured a fish out of another pocket and stuffed it in Big Boss Black’s mouth. Meanwhile, Prince Fu’s hands had started trembling so violently that the paper crinkled in his hands. Ning Xiaoyao knew then that he’d read up to the part where the farmers were rallying to kill their way to Fenglin City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could this have happened?!” Prince Fu shouted after he’d finished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao said innocently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you sent reinforcements yet?” Prince Fu demanded next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao hugged Big Boss Black and said, “I have. Tao Yu’s leading them and they’ll start fighting soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu sat down in front of Ning Xiaoyao and asked, “Tao Yu? Tao Chen’s brother by a concubine? Is he capable?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think so,” Ning Xiaoyao leaned forward and dropped her voice. “You can’t just rely on the army for these things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu was panicking already, but now he was perplexed. “Then what else are you planning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Gramps Li is dividing up your land as we speak,” Ning Xiaoyao said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does that have to do with the roving rebel bands?!” Prince Fu raged. </span><i><span style>Does he never get by without provoking my lungs every day?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t get excited, listen to what I have to say,” Ning Xiaoyao consoled him. “Right now, the rebel army still hasn’t reached Fenglin City.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu took deep breaths. “Fine, I won’t get excited. You talk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What I mean is, let’s not have Old Gramps Li worry over dividing the land, but just hand it over to the neighbors,” Ning Xiaoyao explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu leapt to his feet. “Why are you still talking about land?” His wife and children all lived in Fenglin City. He didn’t dare to imagine the city being invaded!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao reached out a hand and pulled Prince Fu back onto the stool. “I’ve looked into it already. Most of the rebel band consists of refugees.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And the rest?” Prince Fu asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, Supreme Commander said,” Ning Xiaoyao explained, “The rest are just made up of those good-for-nothings who can’t support themselves, so they’re just shamelessly joining the refugees to get a free meal.” (</span><i><span style>Author: Is that </span></i><b><i>really </i></b><i><span style>how Supreme Commander explained it to you?</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu’s voice was filled with hate. “As expected, they’re a despicable lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s talk about the despicable lot later,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “First we should talk about the refugees. They’re rebelling because their families can’t survive anymore, ah. But if they have land and houses and a livelihood, then uncle, do you think they’ll even consider rebelling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu finally took in Ning Xiaoyao’s words. “So Your Majesty is planning to…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spend money to get rid of calamity,” Ning Xiaoyao declared as she slapped the stone table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-whose money are you spending?” Prince Fu was a little lost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your land and your money, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao said boldly. “Uncle, you know that I still owe you salary. I’m really poor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Prince Fu. </span><i><span style>So he still wants my livelihood, ah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, this scheme will be useless for the leader of the rebel bands,” Ning Xiaoyao added. “He’s not worrying about food, he wants our Yongning kingdom. Supreme Commander told me that the reason we lost East Ji’s 19 cities is because all of the refugees there followed Big Boss Xiang’s summons to raise arms and revolt. That’s one of the biggest reasons for the rebellion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you want to stabilize what remaining rebels you still can?” Prince Fu’s gaze on Ning Xiaoyao shifted. </span><i><span style>He’s a shameless wretch with absolutely no virtues, but it looks like he does actually have some ability, ah.</span></i></p>
