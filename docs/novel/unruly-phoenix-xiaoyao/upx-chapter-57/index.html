 <p>Chapter 57: His Majesty has the qualities of an enlightened sovereign&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao took a look at the fatty standing before her. Prince Fu, Ning Guangshun, had the stomach of a seven to eight months pregnant woman. If not for the fact that he was all fat beneath those robes, Ning Xiaoyao would’ve suspected he had </span><a href="https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hydrepigastrium" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>hydrepigastrium</span></a><span style>[1. </span><i><span style>Hydrepigastrium </span></i><span style>(腹肌水) - </span><i><span style>fujishui, </span></i><span style>accumulation of water between the stomach muscles] instead. Don’t assume that women were the only creatures who placed an importance on beauty in this world. Ning Guangshun couldn’t even keep a straight face when Ning Xiaoyao wouldn’t stop staring at his stomach. He wanted to suck his tummy in, but didn’t have the capability to. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, that Prince Fu lost his temper and cried, “If Your Majesty isn’t thinking about the calamity that is Xie Wenyuan, what use is it to stare at this subject?!” Whenever Ning Guangshun got angry, his entire body would shake. His breathing too, sounded like an air blower in use. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, it’s nothing,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Good physique, haha. Very good physique.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Guangshun had a sudden urge to kill Ning Xiaoyao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said everyone else in the hall. </span><i><span style>Truly, His Majesty is a genius when it comes to offending others.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui knew that these relatives were blood-sucking types that were difficult to deal with so he said, “Your Majesty, how about adjourning the session?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Adjourning?” Ning Guangshun asked. “Will Xie Wenyuan’s matter be dropped just like that, leaving a light consequence for such a lofty issue?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao asked, “Then what do you want done?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Guangshun replied, “Is Your Majesty unclear on the crime for fabricating an Imperial Jade Seal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao answered, “Grand Preceptor’s already explained himself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But the Imperial Jade Seal was clearly in Your Majesty’s hands,” another relative piped up. The rest of the clansmen all nodded their heads in agreement. Their eyes were shining like freshly fallen snow. Ning Xiaoyao couldn’t hope to blindside them to pass their obstacle. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stopped speaking. Ning Guangshun laughed coldly and said, “Does Your Majesty still want to protect your maternal clan, even now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao smacked her lips and pointed at the wide open doors leading out of the hall. “How’s this for an idea? Why don’t you take some people to the Grand Preceptor’s estate and kill him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Guangshun choked at her words. </span><i><span style>What was he supposed to kill the Grand Preceptor with?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “This guy, who is he?” She glanced at Lou Zigui, waiting for him to make an introduction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “That one is Prince Fu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Prince Fu,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “</span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>will give you an imperial decree right now. Take some men and go kill the Grand Preceptor, how’s that?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ning Guangshun wouldn’t accept that decree even if they beat him to death! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ning Xiaoyao saw that Prince Fu had chosen to stand there and remain silent, she chuckled. </span><i><span style>What’s the use of yelling at me? If he’s a real man, he should take care of it himself! </span></i><span style>Ning Guangshun’s fleshy face turned alternate shades of green and red from anger. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she pointed at her imperial clansmen, “If any of you guys have a way to kill Grand Preceptor Xie, I’ll yield the Dragon Throne to him.” The clansmen looked at Ning Xiaoyao in surprise. She’d made her imperial position seem like something of such little consequence. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stood up while cradling the Imperial Jade Seal, shaking her head at them with a sigh. “How about you all go home.” These idiots were all talk and no action, she couldn’t count on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Elder Li shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was starting to lose her patience. She stopped and asked, “You want to kill the Grand Preceptor too?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li was delighted to reply. “This old subject is useless and unable to put that Xie crook to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then speak more politely,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “We still have to work together. If you curse the Grand Preceptor as </span><i><span style>‘that Xie crook,’ </span></i><span style>wouldn’t he have to call you </span><i><span style>‘that Li crook’ </span></i><span style>to make things even?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!” Elder Li’s pupils were displeased. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s all stop for a bit,” Ning Xiaoyao signaled Shadowgale to get the jade casket from the Dragon Throne as well, before telling the ministers, “What’s the use of just fighting each other?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, then the official salaries for this subject and others…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander, ah, let’s go,” Ning Xiaoyao hugged the Imperial Jade Seal and ran. </span><i><span style>Official salary, your sister!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His Majesty had fled like the wind, leaving Prince Xi unable to complete his sentence. He nearly choked himself to death. </span><i><span style>Just what kind of man is he? Was there ever an emperor like this?! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Rather than flee with Ning Xiaoyao, Lou Zigui stood standing in the hall with his hands clasped behind his back. His cold stare swept past all the imperial clansmen before he turned and strode away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander,” Ning Guangshun called after him, “Are you His Majesty’s lackey now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui paused in his steps, but didn’t turn around. Instead he said, “What’s wrong with being loyal and devoted to one’s sovereign?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Guangshun raised a hand to stop his fellow clansman from retorting. Lou Zigui had already chosen his branch, so it’d be useless to persuade him otherwise. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lou Zigui left the Hall of Golden Chimes, he was greeted by clear blue skies and the splendid, fiery colors of spring. Ning Xiaoyao had her back to the sun as she stood in a side corridor, leaping and jumping as she waved at him to hurry over. After Lou Zigui reached her, he raised a hand to touch her golden, sun-kissed forehead--but Ning Xiaoyao grabbed his hand instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My God,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she fled down the steps with Lou Zigui in tow just like she was escaping from zombies, “Supreme Commander, didn’t you hear those princes asking me for money?” She chattered away as they ran. “How could I have any money? Let’s run away, quick.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui didn’t even have a chance to speak up as Ning Xiaoyao dragged him along. The Dragon Guards chased behind them, but despite their extreme lightness techniques and speed, they could only watch as His Majesty disappeared from their sights with Lou Zigui. The Supreme Commander’s legs had almost left the ground entirely thanks to Ning Xiaoyao’s insane running speeds. ( o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This,” Shadowrain said, gaping, “Just who is His Majesty’s master?” </span><i><span style>He really could run!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale fell silent for a while. Not being able to outrun Ning Xiaoyao had shaken him up quite a bit. If your master could run better than you, why would he need you to protect him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander’s injuries haven’t fully healed yet, so how can he even run like that?” In the end, this was all Shadowgale said. All of the Dragon Guards fell silent. </span><i><span style>Was Head Commander feeling distress for Supreme Commander’s sake, and thus blaming His Majesty for running too quickly? But somehow, that didn’t seem right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph.” Inside the Hall of Golden Chimes, Ning Guangshun gave a cold snort at Elder Li before leaving the building with his fellow imperial clansmen. By the time Elder Li slowly shuffled out, everyone had left except for the guards in front of the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher?” a pupil supported Elder Li by the arm as he prepared to head down the steps. Elder Li stood at the head of the stairs, looking towards the path leading to the imperial harem. The white feldspar road was devoid of all people and shone golden-yellow beneath the spring sunlight. Because the road lay on a slant and seemed to stretch on endlessly, it resembled a road to the Heavens that disappeared into the horizon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher?” a few more pupils asked when they saw Elder Li stand there unmoving. It didn’t look like he was angry, though.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty has the qualities of an enlightened sovereign,” Elder Li suddenly said softly as he stared at the golden path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few of the adults were stunned by his words. Elder Li pushed aside the pupil supporting him and walked haltingly down the steps. Outstanding rulers didn’t need to possess unmatched literary talents or learning to succeed. Neither did they have to be omniscient and omnipotent. If a sovereign was that powerful, why would he even need a court full of civil and military officials? In Elder Li’s mind, as long as one kept the plight of the people at heart and tolerated all sorts of things with a magnanimous attitude to find the best solution in adversity, he was an outstanding monarch. Ning Xiaoyao’s deeds and actions over the past few days had fulfilled all of these requirements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher,” a few men chased after him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He knew of the Xie Clan’s wrongs, but was unable to pull up their towering tree by the roots,” Elder Li said quietly to them. “So His Majesty knew to retreat while he was still ahead. His Majesty sold off his property in the palace to aid the refugees because he wanted to take care of that matter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just by saving a few refugees?” one of the men asked quietly. “How will that solve the issue of their existence? His Majesty’s lone efforts are like trying to put out a blazing cart of wood with a cup of water--utterly inadequate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At least His Majesty still thinks of the refugees,” Elder Li gave the man a </span><i><span style>look. </span></i><span style>A few others fell into silence. None of the three emperors preceding His Majesty’s rule had ever bothered with the refugees. Perhaps if they had, the refugees wouldn’t have numbered into the hundreds of thousands by now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This old man was disrespectful to His Majesty again and again,” Elder Li said. “But His Majesty hasn’t show this old man a fierce expression from beginning to end. His Majesty was only 14 years old last year, but his capacity for tolerating others is something this old man admires.” (</span><i><span style>Author: If I say that kid’s afraid of you, would you believe it, old gramps? </span></i><span style>&nbsp;o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is as teacher says,” the men chorused. Ning Xiaoyao was far more different than the previous emperor, who didn’t bother with anything at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty will definitely be an outstanding figure after more discipline,” Elder Li suddenly grew daring and energetic. </span><i><span style>What did a subject ask for? Simply the chance to meet an enlightened sovereign!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>More discipline? </span></i><span style>The assembled ministers wanted to fall over at Elder Li’s words. </span><i><span style>Do you really think His Majesty doesn’t have a temper at all?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The little gyrfalcon flew past Elder Li’s head. Of course Xiaoyao was going to be a big and mighty emperor! But this old guy still wanted to torment her? He followed Elder Li and his people as they left the palace gates until he saw the old man preparing to get on his sedan chair. At this moment, the little gyrfalcon forced out a stream of poop that plopped onto Elder Li’s official’s hat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said everyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Awoo,” the little gyrfalcon flew past the palace walls and fled. Elder Li stared at his hand, which was now covered in bird poop after he’d felt his hat. He wasn’t as staunch as Grand Preceptor Xie, and extremely </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysophobia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>mysophobic</span></a><span style> besides. His hand shook, and he wanted to throw up, but after a few dry heaves he simply fainted away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, teacher!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Aiya, </span></i><span style>Elder Li!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher fainted?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone come, hurry--”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Imperial physician!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>… …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chaos descended upon the scene before the imperial palace gates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Achoo!” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gave a big sneeze while sitting inside the Supreme Splendor Hall. She rubbed her nose and told Lou Zigui, “If it’s not the Grand Preceptor saying bad things, it’s probably the empress dowager cursing me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui was currently seated to adjust his breathing. No matter how strong his martial arts were, he still couldn’t compared to the running speeds of a genetically evolved human. Ning Xiaoyao downed a cup of tea into her stomach before tossing the Imperial Jade Seal to Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander, do you think the Grand Preceptor and empress dowager will be docile now?” Lou Zigui placed the Imperial Jade Seal neatly to one side before shaking his head. Ning Xiaoyao poured a cup for him before she said, “Looks like the battles are still long from being over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui raised the teacup and wet his lips. “The royal court is just like a battleground. What you said isn’t wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? There’s such a saying?” Ning Xiaoyao was wearing an expression that clearly said: </span><i><span style>I haven’t studied many books, so you don’t lie to me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Supreme Commander Lou. </span><i><span style>Then why did you talk about battles in the first place?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it,” Ning Xiaoyao picked up the teapot and swallowed a few more mouthfuls before inspecting its celadon surface. “This teapot doesn’t look half bad. Is this worth any money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui felt himself in a difficult position. He’d never entered a pawnshop in his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah </span><i><span style>peh,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao spat before Lou Zigui had a chance to speak. “We can talk about this later. Tonight we’ll have dinner early before finishing up some big business.” Stealing grain was the more important, bigger deal!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...what big business?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!” Fang Tang suddenly ran in, yelling, “It’s not good! Windy’s gyrfalcon pooped on Elder Li’s head. Right now, Elder Li’s fainted away in front of the palace!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Could she play around anymore at this rate?</span></i></p>
