 <p>Chapter 238: You don't know why I'm angry?&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao placed her hand on Zhou Junqi’s chest as she examined Grand Master Kumu from head to toe. Because her expression was too conflicted and her gaze too strange, Grand Master Kumu felt his hairs stand on end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Amitabha. </span></i><span style>Patron, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop </span><i><span style>‘Amitabha-’ing,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said in an affected tone as she randomly felt Zhou Junqi up and down. “Why weren’t you thinking any benevolent thoughts when you screwed me over in the past?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Grand Master Kumu didn’t even have to guess to know that this person was Ning Yu, Yongning’s current emperor. When Ning Xiaoyao saw that he was about to bow, her mouth twitched. She waved a hand and said, “Don’t. If I accept this bow from you, you’ll feel uncomfortable in your heart later too. If you end up claiming I’m incompatible with everyone in Yongning as a result, what will I do then? Find a place to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most people were unused to Ning Xiaoyao upon their first meeting. Grand Master Kumu was no exception and stared at her blankly before said, “This monk doesn’t dare.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you’ve screwed me over once, you can screw me over twice,” Ning Xiaoyao wiped her blood-stained hand against the sheets, then tucked in Zhou Junqi. “Come on, give me another fortune reading for free. Grand Master, where do you think I came from?” </span><i><span style>I’ll know whether or not he’s a holy fraud by his answer.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Great Master Kumu looked at Ning Xiaoyao, his face hesitant. “Your Majesty is of the imperial Ning Clan. For you to rise to your position, you must be none other than the </span><a href="https://javewutaoismplace.blogspot.com/2007/12/pictures-of-celestial-emperor-bei-ji-zi_7964.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>Violet Star Sovereign</span></a><span style> descended down to Earth. You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re saying that I came from Heaven?” Ning Xiaoyao pointed at herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Master Kumu nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao had no idea what a Violet Star Sovereign was, but she was obviously from the apocalypse. Now this monk was claiming she came from the skies? </span><i><span style>As expected, he’s a holy fraud.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty honors us with your grand presence---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing grand about it,” Ning Xiaoyao raised a hand to cut him off again. “Zhou Junqi’s injury been healed. Grand Master, your medical skills seem only so-so, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Master Kumu quickly looked over at Zhou Junqi, who was still unconscious. However, his complexion seemed much healthier than before. When he lifted the covers, it was to see that the arrow wound that had pierced through Zhou Junqi’s chest from the back was now completely healed over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H-how is this possible?” Great Master Kumu cried in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Great Master, why don’t you rub your eyes and check again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Master Kumu exhaled, before looking at Ning Xiaoyao. She put on a respectable, dignified expression that was somewhat ruined by her childish face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miaow!” Big Boss Black meowed viciously at Great Master Kumu. Typically speaking, he’d be scratching anyone who wronged him silly by now. </span><i><span style>Why waste so many words?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Calm down,” Ning Xiaoyao petted Big Boss Black’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Master Kumu stared at Big Boss Black. “Your Majesty is actually raising a black cat. This cat---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Master, if you want to say things like he’s unlucky, he’ll definitely bite you to death,” Ning Xiaoyao interrupted again. “If not that, then scratch you half dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if in response to her words, Big Boss Black lifted his bloody claws for Great Master Kumu to see.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Great Master Kumu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can leave our stuff for another day,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Great Master, let’s talk about the here and now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Master Kumu asked, “Is Your Majesty talking about Esteemed Empress’s matters?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Master,” a voice came from an opening in the secret chamber just then, that of a young monk. “Supreme Commander’s arrived at Iron Buddha Temple. He’s currently facing off against General Chen from the military barracks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao and Big Boss Black exchanged glances. </span><i><span style>Why did Supreme Commander come?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Great Master Kumu glanced hastily towards Ning Xiaoyao. With His Majesty here, it was impossible for him to decide what to do. Ning Xiaoyao took Big Boss Black to a corner and crouched on the ground, where the two of them held a quiet conference.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How come Supreme Commander’s here?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black replied, “Supreme Commander must have come to find you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I left a message saying I went out to buy snacks, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander’s so smart, you think he’ll fall for that?” Once again, Big Boss Black put his Supreme Commander on a pedestal while belittling Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glanced at the tubby furball on her shoulders. “Are you trying to say that Windy is an idiot?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black choked before he snarled, “Stop nitpicking to sow discord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” Ning Xiaoyao chortled coldly, “You’ve become more cultured. Now you can even use idioms when you speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black didn’t know what an idiom was, but he </span><i><span style>did </span></i><span style>know he wanted to scratch this ninny to death. The two little monks went to hide behind Great Master Kumu as they saw an imminent fight about to break out between human and cat. </span><i><span style>Black cats are unlucky and his Majesty---His Majesty doesn’t seem all that normal, either.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Master?” the voice from above called again, sounding panicked. “The switch for the stone entrance is broken, I can’t open it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Great Master Kumu hastily turned towards Ning Xiaoyao. “Your Majesty, you broke the switch to the stone door when you came down?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao tossed Big Boss Black to the ground and looked at him. “There was a switch? I didn’t even know, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, this---” Great Master Kumu knew that things had gotten troublesome. “Then aren’t we simply trapped down here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gave him a sideways glance. “Great Master, you should keep General Zhou company. I’ll find Supreme Commander for a chat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the switch breaks, there’s no way we can get out. Your Majesty, this monk will order the rest to dig us out instead,” Great Master Kumu tried negotiating. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head and started to climb up the steps. “Great Master, don’t worry. I’ll take responsibility for fixing that stone door.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Master Kumu fell silent. He’d been talking about nothing but the switch this whole time. Didn’t His Majesty hear him? Big Boss Black meowed at him a couple of times before chasing after Ning Xiaoyao. Great Master Kumu could only continue to stay mute. </span><i><span style>Just what kind of person is this? And that cat, too---what’s with him?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The two younger monks exchanged glances as well, before bracing themselves to follow behind Ning Xiaoyao. But she walked so quickly that the two monks soon lost sight of her and her cat. By the time they reached the exit, the stone door was already open. The sudden flood of sunlight momentarily blinded them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty made it out?” Great Master Kumu asked when the two monks returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the monks could speak, they heard the sound of a heavy stone falling into place above them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty f...fixed the switch,” one of the little monks stammered out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!” Zhou Junqi suddenly woke up in a start. All Great Master Kumu could think of now was, </span><i><span style>how is this possible?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of the gates to the temple, Chen Lu gave way to Lou Zigui as he spoke. “Since Supreme Commander insists on paying his respects to the Buddha today, please go in.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t that General Chen wanted to let him in, but that he had no way to keep him out. Even though Lou Zigui had only brought along Deng Rong, the man was perfectly prepared to kill him while he had to hesitate in turn. His Majesty would protect Lou Zigui to the death if anything happened, but would Grand Preceptor do the same for him? Chen Lu found the very idea impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the next second saw Ning Xiaoyao opening the temple gates from the inside. She stuck out her head and asked, “Is everyone here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Lu thought he was seeing things. </span><i><span style>How could His Majesty be here?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui creased his brows and covered the distance between them with a few steps. “Why did you come here?” he asked Ning Xiaoyao in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urk,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “I came to pay my respects to the Buddha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui pushed Ning Xiaoyao inside as he entered the temple grounds, conveniently slamming the gates in Deng Rong’s face when he moved to follow. Poor General Deng was left to rub at his throbbing nose before he glanced back at Chen Lu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Lu said, “Shadowgale has already come to escort Esteemed Empress back to the palace.” What General Chen meant to say was, </span><i><span style>the empress is already going back, so what’s His Majesty doing running over to Iron Buddha Temple?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Rong only scowled at him. “His Majesty’s right inside, so you can ask him yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Lu looked at the shut gates of the temple. </span><i><span style>Even if I want to ask, I need to wait for His Majesty to summon me first, ah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side of the doors, Lou Zigui had his hands pressed against Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulders. “Why did you come here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you already, I’m---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t say you’re here to pay respects, that’s the excuse </span><i><span style>I </span></i><span style>used,.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shrugged her shoulders at him. “To tell you the truth, I’m here to rescue Zhou Junqi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s hands trembled minutely before he immediately pressed down harder against her shoulders. Indifferent to the added force, Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her nose and added, “You can’t kill people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui glanced around the courtyard. They were standing in front of the hall for the Four Heavenly Kings, where two bodhi trees stood facing each other with their thick branches and leaves covering the entire space above them to block them from sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao tugged at Lou Zigui’s sleeve and added, “I said that you can’t kill people. Give me a reaction or something, Supreme Commander.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui lowered his head and asked, “You know already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao blinked. “If I didn’t know, I wouldn’t have ran all the way here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t it a good thing to kill off the Zhou Clan siblings?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pondered over that before pulling Lou Zigui to sit beside her on the steps leading to the prayer hall. She cocked her head to one side and said, “We can clearly manage this without killing anyone, so why do you insist on murdering them, Supreme Commander?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because they want to kill you,” Lou Zigui answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t all of this a big farce anyways?” Ning Xiaoyao spread out her arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But those siblings are taking it seriously.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then---then if the person who wants to kill me is the empress, what does General Zhou have to do with it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked at Ning Xiaoyao before he suddenly burst into laughter. “How could it have nothing to do with him? If he hadn’t agreed, the empress would never be so determined to kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head. “That’s not right. It was the empress who steeled her heart first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But didn’t Zhou Junqi agree with her?” Lou Zigui was sounding a little pushy by now. “Since they want to kill you, then I’ll kill them. What’s wrong with that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao scratched her head. </span><i><span style>It looks like we can’t chat about life anymore.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao,” Lou Zigui grabbed her hand with a murmur, “You don’t have to get involved with this. I know what I’m doing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then fine,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Supreme Commander, you tell me. Can that General Xu beat the Grand Preceptor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And if he could?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>If?”</span></i><span style> Ning Xiaoyao echoed. “So it’s not a certainty? </span><i><span style>We </span></i><span style>can’t even kill off the Grand Preceptor ourselves, but you’re pushing General Xu to try the same? Do you have to treat others like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao!” Lou Zigui exclaimed quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao--’Little Yao?’ It won’t make a difference even if you call me Dayao---’Big Yao.’ I’ll still think the same way,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “The empress wants to murder me, but I’m not even angry. So why are you, Supreme Commander? It’s not like she could really kill me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s expression grew dark. “You don’t know why I’m angry?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pursed her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me, do you really not know?” Lou Zigui held Ning Xiaoyao by the chin, refusing to let her look away.</span></p>
