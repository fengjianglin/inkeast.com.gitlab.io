 <p>Chapter&nbsp;109: There's no need to use knives on my face<span class="hidden-text">&nbsp;Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Duke of Liang was one of the thirteen dukes who’d fought with the Ning Clan’s ancestors in the past to establish the current reigning dynasty. They’d been conferred with the surname of Ning, had commander-in-chiefs who took captive prisoners-of-war, and guarded the nine sectors of Yongning’s southwest region up to the present day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My father is the Duke of Yue, Ning Heng.[1. </span><i><span style>Ning Heng </span></i><span style>(宁恒) - </span><i><span style>Heng </span></i><span style>means “perseverance.”] My eldest brother is a cavalry general, his name’s Ning Xiaomu,[2. </span><i><span style>Ning Xiaomu </span></i><span style>(宁晓暮) - </span><i><span style>Xiao </span></i><span style>means “dawn, daybreak,” </span><i><span style>Mu </span></i><span style>means “dusk, evening, sunset.”] and my second eldest brother is General Ning Xiaoxiāo,[3. </span><i><span style>Ning Xiaoxiāo </span></i><span style>(宁晓萧) - </span><i><span style>Xiao </span></i><span style>means “dawn, daybreak,” </span><i><span style>Xiāo </span></i><span style>means “desolate, dreary.” Please note that the two </span><i><span style>xiaos </span></i><span style>are pronounced with different tones in Chinese.] who commands one of the garrison posts.” Ning Xiaoluo said proudly to Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what kind of general are you?” Ning Xiaoyao asked in curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo’s face stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, you’re not one at all,” Ning Xiaoyao suddenly understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo was quick to explain himself. “My body’s not very good, so I can’t practice martial arts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao observed the boy, who was taller than her by half a head, and patted his shoulder sympathetically. “Try a bit harder. Maybe you’ll still have a chance to grow taller.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo looked at Ning Xiaoyao, unsatisfied. “You’re not even as tall as me. My mother said I was born as a boy who looked like a girl, but you’re a boy who looks even more girly than me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>You really want to compare yourself with a female to see who’s more girly?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo’s head turned to look at the youth on the metal bed before his mood turned somber. “He was still alive a moment ago,” he said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you get captured?” Ning Xiaoyao was looking around for something to cover up the body, but she couldn’t find anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was captured as soon as I entered the city gates,” Ning Xiaoluo took off his outer robes and draped them over the dead body on the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you come to the capital for?” Ning Xiaoyao asked next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was almost the Grand Preceptor’s birthday, so I came to give him a present,” Ning Xiaoluo said, before he angrily waved his arms. “Just wait ‘til I tell the Grand Preceptor about this. He’ll definitely kill these bastards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh,” Ning Xiaoyao chuckled. </span><i><span style>After all that effort, I ended up saving a young member of the Grand Preceptor’s faction!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Benefactor, why are you laughing like that?” Ning Xiaoluo asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was currently thinking over the course of events. Something about this felt off. This boy was part of the Grand Preceptor’s faction, so why would Grand Preceptor Xie want him dead? “You,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she prepared to beat him up, “These are part of the Grand Preceptor’s grounds, ah. You went to give him a present, but why did he have you captured? Did he not like your gift?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo was flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t know you’re on the Grand Preceptor’s property?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re lying,” Ning Xiaoluo’s gaze changed as he stared at Ning Xiaoyao. “You must be on the same side as those guys. You’re acting out a play to win my trust. Speak, what do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wanted to spit up blood. “Are you a doofus?” His Majesty Ning asked the Third Young Master Ning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t believe you,” Ning Xiaoluo backed away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever,” Ning Xiaoyao didn’t want to talk to that idiot anymore. She looked at the five men sprawled on the ground. All of their fingers had been broken by her attacks. How could someone who studied medicine try to hurt people? </span><i><span style>I’ll make it impossible for you to practice medicine for the rest of your life!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo kept backing away. Despite being born in a general’s family, he was the type who pondered over minute details and feared the sight of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You take care,” Ning Xiaoyao shot a glance at the blockhead before picking up the dead patient’s corpse and turning to leave. Ning Xiaoluo hesitated for a few seconds before running after her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you think I was a bad guy?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you are, I still want to get out of here,” Ning Xiaoluo replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling you, it’s Grand Preceptor Xie who’s the real villain here,” Ning Xiaoyao said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t believe it,” the third young master Ning replied. “My paternal grandmother was handkerchief friends[4. </span><i><span style>handkerchief friends </span></i><span style>(手帕交) - </span><i><span style>shoupa jiao, </span></i><span style>a colloquial term that means ‘childhood friends,’ especially when it comes to female friendships.] with the Old Madame of the Xie Clan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s a handkerchief friend?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It means they’re good sisters,” Third Young Master Ning replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Biological sisters?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sworn sisters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao smiled coldly upon hearing his explanation. Grand Preceptor Xie was even capable of hurting his own granddaughter, much less sworn relatives. What were they worth in that old man’s eyes?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You,” Ning Xiaoluo noticed Oil Lamp and Oil Jar on Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulders. “You have mice on your shoulders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m raising them,” Ning Xiaoyao answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Third Young Master Ning. </span><i><span style>There are people who keep mice as pets? These capital city people sure know how to fool around!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The stone room beyond the first one was still strewn with the unconscious forms of the various men. At the foot of the stone steps was King Flower, who stuck out its tongue at Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>“Hisssss…..”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Snake!” Ning Xiaoluo cried out in alarm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao simply pretended that Ning Xiaoluo didn’t exist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry and get out of here,” King Flower said. “The Grand Preceptor sent men over, they’re planning to burn this place down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao grew alarmed. “I’ve been exposed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Flower shook his head. “That shouldn’t be it. They didn’t mention you at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo was wondering whether he was going crazy. </span><i><span style>Why does it look like Ning Xiaoyao’s talking to the snake?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Get on,” Ning Xiaoyao bent down to offer King Flower a perch. “I run really fast, so I can get you out of here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Flower crept forward and wrapped himself around Ning Xiaoyao’s waist. Ning Xiaoluo was so scared he wanted to scream, but Ning Xiaoyao simply grabbed his collar and threatened, “I’ll leave you behind if you dare to shout!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo clapped a hand over his mouth, and Ning Xiaoyao pulled him along as she ran up to the surface. Third Young Master Ning felt the wind whistling past his ears as he was dragged along, his feet not even touching the ground. The gales were so fierce that he couldn’t even keep his eyes open. By the time he finally managed to open them, he discovered that he was standing outside of the basement chamber.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This, this is a rock formation?” Ning Xiaoluo said as he observed the cave and decorative rocks about them. Ning Xiaoyao pulled Ning Xiaoluo with her as she leapt off the formation. As soon as she landed, she heard quick footsteps coming towards the rocks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo opened his mouth. “Where is this--”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!” Once again, Ning Xiaoyao dragged Ning Xiaoluo behind her as she scaled the wall by the flower gardens. Fortunately, a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styphnolobium_japonicum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>Chinese scholar tree</span></a><span style> was growing right by the wall, its luxuriant spread of leaves a perfect cover that hid Ning Xiaoyao and Ning Xiaoluo. Stooping on the wall, Ning Xiaoyao completely ignored her human companion to ask King Flower, “What about the rest of your family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’ve already left,” King Flower said carelessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They left?” </span><i><span style>His whole family scattered just like that, but he’s still so calm? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn’t get it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it just me, or are you talking to that snake?” Ning Xiaoluo asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up,” Ning Xiaoyao fumed at Ning Xiaoluo. </span><i><span style>Speaking of which, why did I bring along a jerk who believes in Grand Preceptor Xie in the first place? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Don’t you have to ask yourself for that? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo unhappily stayed put by Ning Xiaoyao’s side. He looked at the ground beneath the wall, but it was too high for him to jump off…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then where will you go?” Ning Xiaoyao was still fretting for King Flower’s sake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll find a new home,” King Flower was still calm and unperturbed. “It’ll be fine as long as I don’t starve to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“True, that’s one of my life goals too,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Twenty or so retainers dressed in the servant robes of Grand Preceptor Xie’s estate ran into the gardens at this moment with lit torches in their hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These are…” Ning Xiaoluo narrowed his eyes for a closer look. “These are the Grand Preceptor’s men?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn’t say a word. She’d already told him these were the Grand Preceptor’s grounds, but the idiot hadn’t believed her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor sent people to rescue me!” Ning Xiaoluo was moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao curled her lips in contempt. </span><i><span style>He’s so stupid, he’s reached a whole new world altogether.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey,” Ning Xiaoluo asked Ning Xiaoyao next. “Who are you? Who’s your mother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao replied, “There’s no need for us to see each other in the future. You can just call me Anonymous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you ever gone to the southwest?” Ning Xiaoluo probed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope. I haven’t even explored the entire capital city yet,” Ning Xiaoyao said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about your mother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She hasn’t either,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. Empress Dowager Xie hadn’t left the palace ever since she went in, except for the time she gave birth to Ning Yu. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Third Young Master Ning could put his worries to rest. This boy couldn’t possibly be one of his father’s sons. Aside from a single trip with his wife to the capital 15 years ago, his father had lived in the southwest for his entire life. If the boy’s mother had never gone to the southwest, then she never would have met his father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao scratched her head. “I think your questions are a little weird. Isn’t there something off about them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way,” Ning Xiaoluo hastily shook his head. Anyone would be mad if you assumed who their father was, right? Especially a guy like this, who he could never hope to beat in a fight. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The retainers carried their torches as they scaled the rock formation, pressed on the hidden switch, and re-opened the stone door that Ning Xiaoyao had carefully shut behind her. Then they simply started pouring oil onto the steps of the tunnel below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That smell,” Ning Xiaoluo sniffed the air furiously before his face paled. “It’s kerosene.” In the military, kerosene was used to burn down cities and cause widescale destruction. Third Young Master Ning had been familiar with its smell since he was young, so there was no way he’d be mistaken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Ning Xiaoyao remarked sarcastically. “They’re preparing to light a fire before they go and save you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo wiped the rainwater off his face and said, “That’s not right. Those people must be fakes. They just can’t be the Grand Preceptor’s men!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned to look at Ning Xiaoluo. </span><i><span style>Did the Grand Preceptor feed this kid a bewitching potion or something? Why is he so convinced that the Grand Preceptor’s a good guy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“They’ve lit the oil on fire!” Oil Lamp squeaked. Ning Xiaoyao turned back to see black smoke pouring out from the inside of the stone tunnel. All of the Grand Preceptor’s retainers had retreated to the base of the rockery.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shoot! </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao suddenly recalled that there were still people in the basement! When she had ran out, it was under the assumption that the Grand Preceptor would never kill his own men. Now reality proved that she’d thought too kindly of the man and his subordinates!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone else’s arrived,” Oil Jar squeaked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A gentleman wearing brocade robes walked into the courtyard while holding an umbrella above his head. Two guards accompanied him on each side with lanterns in their hands. Ning Xiaoyao recognized the newcomer at a glance as one of the Xie sons she’d punished earlier that day, Grand Preceptor Xie’s third son Xie Anshi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve, I’ve seen him before,” Ning Xiaoluo mumbled to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve seen him before too,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “He’s Xie Anshi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black smoke rolling out from the rockery had now changed to red, looking almost devilishly alluring beneath the rainy night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Poison smoke,” Ning Xiaoluo said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao spat out a mouthful of rainwater that had trickled into her mouth. </span><i><span style>Then it’s all over. There’s no saving the people inside the basement now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anshi stood at the foot of the rockery and asked, “The man you’ve brought in today is inside there as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A retainer hastily replied with an affirmative. “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anshi stared at the rock formations, which were now shrouded in a cloud of red smoke. “Once the fire goes out, seal the basement.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned to Ning Xiaoluo and murmured, “Do you still think the Grand Preceptor’s a good guy now?”</span></p>
