 <p>Chapter&nbsp;173: The empress dowager buys people's hearts&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao spun the hairless brush between her fingers as she asked A’Ming, “Then how long do we have to keep going north?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very, very long, oh~” A’Ming replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao asked, “Then how long is very very long?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A’Ming replied, “Very, very long, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>It’s really hard to communicate with you, isn’t it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A’Ming lowered his head to peck at a few rice grains in a basin as he added, “Xiaoyao, if I eat too much of this, I’ll have trouble pooping.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hm?” Ning Xiaoyao’s train of thought were distracted by A’Ming’s words. “Geese like you have constipation problems, too?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black scratched Ning Xiaoyao’s hand and meowed, “Supreme Commander’s big brother, Supreme Commander’s big brother, </span><i><span style>Supreme Commander’s big brother!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t get agitated,” A’Ming said in a slow voice. “Even if you know where your Supreme Commander’s big brother is, there’s no way you can save him right now anyway.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our Supreme Commander’s big brother?” Ning Xiaoyao echoed blankly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A’Ming held his head up high. “I am a wild goose from beyond the Great Wall!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao blinked. </span><i><span style>I see, so this is a foreign goose.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A’Ming nibbled on a bit of salted fish next and added, “It’s not good to eat too much salty things either, your feathers will fall out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so fussy, miaow!” Big Boss Black wanted to bite this goose to death. Ning Xiaoyao grabbed him and held him in her lap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she asked, “Brother A’Ming, can you verify that one slave is Supreme Commander’s big brother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A’Ming replied, “I’ve heard the Wolf King of the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>call him Lou Jing,[1. </span><i><span style>Lou Jing </span></i><span style>(楼璟) - </span><i><span style>Jing </span></i><span style>has an archaic definition that means “luster of jade.”] ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s Lou Jing?” Ning Xiaoyao asked automatically without giving the name another thought. Abruptly, the little flower garden fell silent as all the animals stared at her. Instead of showing his claws this time, Big Boss Black bared his fangs and prepared to bite her until Ning Xiaoyao whapped him on the head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Big Boss Black shouted, “Lou Jing is Supreme Commander’s big brother, ah! </span><i><span style>You ninny!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Realizing that she’d been a blockhead yet again, Ning Xiaoyao was shamed into fury. She shouted back, “I could’ve figured it out on my own without your help!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black didn’t want to talk to Ning Xiaoyao anymore. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A’Ming quietly asked Grandpa Sparrow, “Do you guys really believe that she can save Lou Jing and bring him back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandpa Sparrow suddenly realized that he wasn’t confident enough to nod and say yes... </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, hey,” the hurt Ning Xiaoyao spoke up. “I can hear what you’re saying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A’Ming only lowered his head to keep eating his salted fish. Grandpa Sparrow asked, “Xiaoyao, what are your plans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao folded up the white paper and placed it back in her bag, before saying, “I’ll find a chance to leave for the borders sometime. If the people there won’t tell me where White Wolf Gorge is, I can ask the animals for directions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That works,” A’Ming replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao patted her chest. “I’ll use actions to prove that I’m dependable to you all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop boasting,” Big Boss Black looked askance at Ning Xiaoyao. “You should set a date to travel first. Do you think you can take a step outside the border without killing a scourge like Grand Preceptor Xie first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao clutched her head. </span><i><span style>That’s right, ah. That is a real problem. Unless I kill off that old Xie geezer, I won’t be able to leave without worrying.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone’s coming,” a little sparrow called from the Wutong tree branch above their heads. Ning Xiaoyao raised her head and saw Shadowbolt running her way. The fourth commander of the Dragon Guards saw the wild goose by her side as soon as he entered the gardens and gave a start. </span><i><span style>Isn’t it supposed to be impossible to domesticate that kind of bird?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Fourth Lightning,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “How did the Little Peach Blossom issue resolve itself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale quickly recovered his senses and walked to Ning Xiaoyao’s side. “To reply Your Majesty, this servant delivered Little Peach Blossom to the empress dowager’s palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And Windy?” Ning Xiaoyao was still worried about Shadowgale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt replied, “Big bro went to the palace gates. Your Majesty, I think he’s alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think he’d cry in front of you if he wasn’t?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt was left unable to reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Aiyo,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao fretted. “There are so many things I need to worry about!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt said, “Your Majesty, is there anything this servant can do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help Windy find a wife,” Ning Xiaoyao replied immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt shut his mouth. He couldn’t help with that when he couldn’t even find a wife for himself! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fourth Lightning, have you ever heard of White Wolf Gorge?” Ning Xiaoyao asked suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt shook his head. “Your Majesty, where’s that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sighed. “One of the imperial hunting parks owned by Northern </span><i><span style>Hu’s </span></i><span style>king.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt scratched his head. He had no idea why His Majesty was suddenly concerned with Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>hunting grounds. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently at the empress dowager’s palace, Little Peach Blossom was kneeling in front of Empress Dowager Xie as she trembled uncontrollably. Empress Dowager Xie examined her from head to toe. Here was a girl with peach-like eyes, a slender waist, and clear, lucid eyes. </span><i><span style>Was Shadowgale blind to ignore such a beauty before his eyes?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Little Peach Blossom hadn’t knelt long before she started crying and kowtowing. “Esteemed Empress Dowager, have mercy. This servant really don’t know where things went wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true, ah. This Dowager can’t figure it out, either. His Majesty was actually able to tell that something was wrong,” Empress Dowager Xie raised a hand to help the girl up. A ray of hope shone in Little Peach Blossom’s chest as the empress dowager allowed her to rise. </span><i><span style>She’s not going to kill me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie’s expression was divided between eight parts helplessness and two parts grief. She seemed a completely different person from the woman who had faced off against Ning Xiaoyao earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should leave,” Empress Dowager Xie told Little Peach Blossom. “This Dowager doesn’t want your life, but it’s hard to tell what His Majesty thinks on the matter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“E-Esteemed Empress Dowager,” Little Peach Blossom stammered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were born from an official’s family,” Empress Dowager Xie said. “So you’ll have your share of support after leaving the palace. His Majesty only knows you by Little Peach Blossom, so This Dowager promises that he’ll never find out your true identity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Peach Blossom fell to her knees again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on,” Empress Dowager Xie added. “Just treat everything that happened in the palace as a nightmare. Find yourself a husband outside the palace walls.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>stepped forward with a bundle, and Empress Dowager Xie said, “This Dowager shall reward you with this. It should be enough to last you the rest of your days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Peach Blossom kowtowed her head against the ground three times towards Empress Dowager Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave now,” Empress Dowager Xie murmured softly. “You should go quickly, while This Dowager can still protect your life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>placed the bundle in Little Peach Blossom’s hands and led her out of the palace gates. The other court ladies and eunuchs who saw her crying face could only worry for themselves. Suppose His Majesty really tried to kill Esteemed Empress Dowager one day? </span><i><span style>What would happen to us then?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Lou Zigui had reached the palace gates and dismounted from his horse. He gave the reins of his battle stallion, Little Red, to one of the imperial guards who came to greet him and went inside. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>led Little Peach Blossom towards the exit as she spoke. “Your ancestors accumulated virtue to bless you an escape from death this time. After you leave the palace, you should look out for yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Peach Blossom only nodded in silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have to remember Esteemed Empress Dowager’s great kindness,” the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Little Peach Blossom assented. Her words and expression betrayed nothing beyond her gratitude, but Little Peach Blossom was very clear in her heart that she never would’ve ended up like this if she hadn’t worked for the empress dowager in the first place. </span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the Dragon Guards stationed in the shadows saw the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>lead Little Peach Blossom out and ran to report to Supreme Splendor Hall. Meanwhile, Lou Zigui had run into Shadowgale at the entrance and beckoned for him to accompany him. Then he muttered, “Little Peach Blossom is one of the empress dowager’s agents. His Majesty didn’t know how to break the news to you, so let me tell you instead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale’s expression didn’t change. “Just earlier, Esteemed Empress Dowager brought her to Supreme Splendor Hall, so I already know her identity. His Majesty told me everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s steps stilled. “What was she doing there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale told Lou Zigui everything that had happened in Supreme Splendor Hall in his absence. Lou Zigui couldn’t curse the empress dowager outright, but he only smiled coldly once Shadowgale had finished. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale said, “It was my fault. I’ve met with that court lady multiple times, but I never saw anything off about her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui asked, “Has that court lady ever asked you about His Majesty’s affairs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale shook his head. “No, not even once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She didn’t reveal any weak points, so it’s only natural that you didn’t suspect anything,” Lou Zigui said. “There’s no use over thinking things. She was only a woman, after all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale could only nod in agreement. By the time they and the rest of the Black Frost Cavalry reached Supreme Splendor Hall, they spotted a Dragon Guard running over from the direction of the empress dowager’s palace. Lou Zigui stopped at the foot of the steps and waited until the man had arrived, before asking, “What’s happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guard glanced at Shadowgale before reporting, “Esteemed Empress Dowager has ordered a </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>to bring Little Peach Blossom out of the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui furrowed his brows. </span><i><span style>Empress Dowager Xie certainly knows how to buy people’s hearts. </span></i><span style>“Which door did she leave from?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guard said, “A small door on the southern side of the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale was about to leave when Lou Zigui raised a hand to stop him. He then told the Dragon Guard, “Take a trip outside the palace. Be sure to bring back Little Peach Blossom’s head.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guard replied with an assent and prepare to leave, when Lou Zigui suddenly called out, “Hold it. Don’t go. You---” Supreme Commander Lou now looked towards one of his Black Frost Cavalry generals, “You go instead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The general obeyed and walked away with large strides. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You men are officials of the palace,” Lou Zigui explained to Shadowgale and the other Dragon Guard. “There’s no need for you to create these kind of grudges with the empress dowager.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you guys talking about?” Ning Xiaoyao had strode out from the doors of Supreme Splendor Hall and appeared in front of Lou Zigui in a flash. “Who’s going to create a grudge with the empress dowager?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing,” Lou Zigui said as he pulled Ning Xiaoyao up the steps. Dropping his voice, he added, “We were just discussing about how the empress dowager sent that Little Peach Blossom out of the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao looked over at Shadowgale, who seemed as normal as ever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry about that anymore,” Lou Zigui said. “She was nothing but a court lady, so when will you stop thinking about her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well dang,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Why would I worry about Little Peach Blossom? I’m only fretting over where to find a good girl for Shadowgale. There’s plenty of women in the palace, but how do I know whether they’re agents of the empress dowager?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “The females in the palace are all Your Majesty’s women.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh,” Ning Xiaoyao chuckled. Lou Zigui glanced at her before he remembered. </span><i><span style>Right, this is a girl too…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Did those seven men go back?” Ning Xiaoyao decided to change the topic. It was borderline abuse talking about girls and love with Supreme Commander when he didn’t understand either topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They have,” Lou Zigui said. “Xie Wenyuan didn’t send any men after them like we expected him to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao blinked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I arranged for men to play the role of killers sent from the Grand Preceptor’s estate,” Lou Zigui added as he reached out to stroke Ning Xiaoyao’s face. She shook her head a few times and prepared to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to call me a bad guy again?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao swallowed the words sitting in her throat and said, quite against her will, “No, I was thinking you were really dashing, Supreme Commander. Yay~” Ning Xiaoyao made a victory gesture with her fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Lou Zigui.</span></p>
