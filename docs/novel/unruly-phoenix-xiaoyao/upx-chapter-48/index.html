 <p>Chapter 48: A way to deal with villains&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao walked out of the empress dowager’s palace with her head held high and chest puffed out as she spoke to Shadowgale and the rest, who were still in a trance. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me tell you guys, there’s nothing scary about villains. There’s only one way to deal with them, and that’s bully, bully, and bully again. Make them too scared to act like villains, make them…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui reached out a hand to muffle Ning Xiaoyao and said quietly, “Your Majesty must guard your tongue.” Standing in front of the empress dowager’s palace while ranting about bullying them? Any son or daughter who spoke of their mother this way was in for a bad end. Ning Xiaoyao only made a </span><i><span style>‘che’ </span></i><span style>in response. Was she supposed to wait until the empress dowager bullied her instead? </span><i><span style>In your dreams.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s fuming made Lou Zigui unable to stop himself from pinching her puffed up cheeks. Quietly he said, “Your mouth is so wide that it looks like it’s going to split open. Has Your Majesty gotten your hands on the Imperial Jade Seal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao went (￣￣△￣；). </span><i><span style>Was she that easy to read?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s talk about it in the Imperial Palace, hm?” Lou Zigui smiled as he pinched Ning Xiaoyao’s dazed face again. Ning Xiaoyao covered her cheeks and glowered at Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>What was he playing at? </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui coughed lightly and withdrew his hand. This little lady always made his hands itch to pinch her here and there. He never expected himself to act that way, either. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale and the rest were still too lost in their trance to notice Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou’s ‘defiance’ against the sovereign. He’d smashed the empress dowager’s doors, tore down her side chambers, and even angered her to the point of tears despite the fact that she’d reigned as an evil seductress in all her years as an imperial concubine. The Dragon Guards were still marveling at how manly His Majesty was!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The row of people arrived quickly at the foot of the stairs to the emperor’s Imperial Palace. The little gyrfalcon flew out from the palace and landed on Shadowgale’s shoulder, before chirping a few times at Ning Xiaoyao. “Xiaoyao, I put the Imperial Jade Seal on your bed. I even hid it beneath the covers~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao dug out some stir-fried </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicia_faba" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>broad beans</span></a><span style> from her pocket and said, “Little gyrfalcon, I’m treating you to these.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little gyrfalcon abandoned his owner’s shoulder for Ning Xiaoyao’s and ate the tasty, crunchy beans directly from the palm of her hand. Shadowgale’s feelings were mixed upon seeing his increasingly round gyrfalcon. If His Majesty kept feeding him like this, would he get too fat to fly? What would he do then?</span></p>
 <p><span style>High above the steps to the Imperial Palace, the two eunuchs flanking both sides saw the approaching group and hastened to bow. Lou Zigui followed behind Ning Xiaoyao to walk past the front courtyard and into the winding covered walkways. Only then did he say in a low voice, “Your Majesty, this subject is here and will definitely find a way to take care of the matter regarding the Imperial Jade Seal. This subject asks that Your Majesty refrain from putting yourself into danger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao was stupefied. Hadn’t this person already guessed that she had the Imperial Jade Seal on hand? Why was he telling these things to her now? Did Supreme Commander</span> <span style>have multiple personalities?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui bent down slightly and asked, “Your Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All, alright,” Ning Xiaoyao could only reply. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui kept walking forward as he said, “Your Majesty needn’t worry, this subject will find a way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Ning Xiaoyao scratched her head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve already sent people outside the palace,” Lou Zigui added. “The Imperial Jade Seal can’t be in the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao scratched her palms, feeling that something was off. The walkway turned another corner, changing the scenery from a water scene to a copse of dense bamboo on both sides. Wind whistled gently through the bamboo plants and echoed down the walkway. While Ning Xiaoyao was standing still to look up at the bamboo, Lou Zigui took the chance to signal Shadowgale with his eyes. Shadowgale bowed and turned to leave. The gyrfalcon saw his owner depart, but thought it over before deciding to stay with Ning Xiaoyao and her yummy food. Thus, he stood on her shoulder without moving~ </span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon enough, a head eunuch ran out from the walkway before stopping at the curve as if he was preparing to take a step forward. Shadowgale emerged from the depths instead and recognized him as the head eunuch. “Steward Hu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Steward Hu hastily pasted on a smile. “Is Head Commander planning to head out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale looked towards the courtyard behind Steward Hu, where a few eunuchs and court ladies were standing there like a pile of wood. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just now, this one heard from the young eunuchs at the gate that His Majesty’s returned?” Steward Hu asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If there’s no business, don’t just enter the residences of the main palace,” Shadowgale said coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, yes,” Steward Hu nodded. “This one understands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale glanced at the courtyard again, his eyes like a dagger. All of the eunuchs and court ladies there felt a chill despite standing in the sun. Steward Hu stood at the foot of the steps leading to the covered walkway without asking Shadowgale what he was doing. He kept a cheerful expression all the while. Shadowgale then turned and quickly walked back into the covered walkway. When Steward Hu saw that he had disappeared, his smile vanished. Then he headed for a small cobblestone path in the front courtyard and went towards the western end of the emperor’s Imperial Palace. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A short while later, Shadowgale reappeared by a small path leading to the empress dowager’s palace before ducking into a small copse of trees by the road. In the time it took to burn half a stick of incense, a young eunuch hastily made his way out of the Imperial Palace. He didn’t take the main roads, but kept to the small paths. Once he’d left the Imperial Palace behind hi, this young eunuch ran straight past Shadowgale’s hiding place in the trees to head for the empress dowager’s palace. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ning Xiaoyo returned to the Imperial Palace, she ran to her room and flung aside the covers of her bed. Then she opened up the Imperial Jade Seal box and took out the square-shaped jade seal inlaid with gold. Giving it a kiss, she quickly brought it to Lou Zigui, who had followed behind her, and asked, “Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>take a look. Is this the Imperial Jade Seal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui took the seal into his hands and carefully examined it, before replying, “Without a doubt, this is the Imperial Jade Seal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao clapped her hands and said happily, “Then that’s good, everything’s fine now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui placed the Imperial Jade Seal back in its box and asked softly, “Your Majesty, how did you get your hands on it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little gyrfalcon was very smug as he perched on the table: ︿(￣︶￣)︿ He had a part in it too.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could she say that her animal companions had helped her? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao reckoned that Lou Zigui wouldn’t believe it, so she only laughed and said, “Guess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right,” Ning Xiaoyao turned serious. “Grandpa Ash who lives in the empress dowager’s palace told me where the Imperial Jade Seal was.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s Grandpa Ash?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An old mouse,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. Lou Zigui placed a hand on his forehead, while Ning Xiaoyao tilted her head to look at him. “You don’t believe it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “If Your Majesty doesn’t want to say, then forget it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sighed. She knew things would end up like this. Lou Zigui looked at the Imperial Jade Seal in its box. In his mind, His Majesty must have informers in the empress dowager’s palace just as the empress dowager had informers in His Majesty’s palace. These results had come about from a concerted effort between His Majesty and his subordinates. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty is very formidable,” Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou praised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao puffed up her little chest. She thought she was pretty formidable too, since she’d used a sack of peanuts to trade for the Imperial Jade Seal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hide the facts for now,” Lou Zigui closed the box as he spoke. “There’s still one more day before the small assembly. Let’s see what the Xie father and mother will do first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was startled again. Why was there no end to it? “Isn’t the Imperial Jade Seal in our hands?” she asked, “What else do they plan to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui patted Ning Xiaoyao’s head. “The empress dowager doesn’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the Imperial Jade Seal disappeared after I went to see her, wouldn’t she and the Grand Preceptor figure it out?” Ning Xiaoyao didn’t think that the Xie father and daughter were so stupid. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll make sure they can’t figure it out,” Lou Zigui said as he smiled at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao blinked. She rather liked it when the Supreme Commander smiled, but her IQ couldn't keep up with him. What's to be done about that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black jumped through the window then and walked to the bed before jumping on it. “Miaow, this cat’s returned. Xiaoyao, aren't you going to tell Supreme Commander</span> <span style>how this cat helped out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ning Xiaoyao looked at Big Boss Black, she felt cured again. Who was the real stupid one? Would the Supreme Commander</span> <span style>believe her just because she said so? Just then, she'd tried it out herself and he hadn't believed a word! (</span><i><span style>Author: If you have any more IQ, then you wouldn't have tried in the first place, hey!</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>,” </span></i><span style>Big Boss Black meowed at </span><i><span style>Supreme Commander </span></i><span style>Lou, “I was the one who took the Imperial Jade Seal out of the empress dowager’s bed with my mouth. Please praise me, please hold me, meow~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stared at the cat meowing at him nonstop and asked, “Is he hungry?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao picked up Big Boss Black and threw him onto the grass outside the window. The species and gender were both wrong, so what was this fat black furball meowing for? If there was a chance, she was going to find Jiao Jiao and have a good talk with her. (</span><i><span style>Author: What could you two talk about? </span></i><span style>&nbsp;o(╯□╰)o ) When the little gyrfalcon saw Big Boss Black sailing into the air in a perfect arc, he clutched his stomach and cried out as he rolled around the table. Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou fell silent, but couldn't help but feel that he was missing out on something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>are you hungry?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he heard this question again, Lou Zigui lifted a hand to rub Ning Xiaoyao’s head. “I’m going to plan things out. If Your Majesty is hungry, I'll order someone to tell the imperial kitchens.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you planning out?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Something to make sure the empress dowager and Grand Preceptor won't suspect that Your Majesty has the Imperial Jade Seal,” Lou Zigui replied. “Did Your Majesty forget what we just talked about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Ning Xiaoyao. How was she supposed to remember so many things? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll be back in a bit,” Lou Zigui said as he left the room. Ning Xiaoyao gaped after him. </span><i><span style>What about when he said he was going to call for the imperial kitchens?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black called out then from the window. “Xiaoyao, Grandpa Ash has come again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Ning Xiaoyao heard that name, she thought of Elder Li and trembled as she sat on the bed. She hadn't even prepared the sack of peanuts yet. Grandpa Ash jump in through the window, followed by Oil Jar and another little mouse.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hmm?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Ning Xiaoyao saw this new little mouse, her forehead creased. There was a large tumor growing on the end of his tail that was even larger than the mouse himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao, this is my elder cousin,” Oil Jar shouted as he entered the room. “He's sick, so my auntie told him to enter the palace and find Ancestral Grandfather for ideas. Xiaoyao, can you help my elder cousin take a look?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course there was no problem with that. Ning Xiaoyao jumped off the bed and reached out a hand to grab Oil Jar’s cousin. But as soon as she tried, the mouse hastily went to hide behind Grandpa Ash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My auntie’s very pitiful,” Oil Jar said sadly, “Of all the mice in her litter, only my elder cousin survived. The rest were all eaten by cats.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Oil Jar, could you not drag us cats into everything?” Big Boss Black shouted from the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe you guys were the very ones who ate them!” Oil Jar bared his teeth at Big Boss Black, who felt stifled by the sight. Where had his birth gone wrong so that even a little mouse could bare its fangs at him?</span></p>

 <p><strong>Lou Zigui:</strong> Why is Your Majesty...holding up a flower branch?</p>
