 <p>Chapter&nbsp;121: Who's guilty of throwing the rock?<span class="hidden-text">&nbsp;Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan shook his head, trying to clear his mind after being led in confusing circles by Ning Xiaoyao. Then he knelt in front of her and said, “This subject accepts the decree.” </span><i><span style>Forget about money, I’ll even give him my life right now if he wants it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao helped him up and said, “Accepts the decree? You’re agreeing to lend me money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan replied, “It’s not lending, Your Majesty. Even this subject’s life belongs to Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t say things like that,” Ning Xiaoyao hastily shook her head. “It can’t all go to me. You still have to live a good life with Miss Qin. Don’t you need money to raise a wife and kids? General Qin, you need to learn how to save money, understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan was deeply moved by such words, but he didn’t want to talk any more. </span><i><span style>Just who brought up the topic of money in the first place? Here I am expressing my loyalty while the emperor is telling me how to save up.</span></i><span style> Regional Commander Qin felt that he was getting a figurative face slap. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui grabbed Ning Xiaoyao and pulled her over to his side. “Enough already,” he murmured to her. “You did very well with your first words, but did you have to mention the second half?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought back. </span><i><span style>What did I say in the second half?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan told Ning Xiaoyao, “Your Majesty, if everything goes well, this subject guarantees that I’ll be able to get silver out of those mines within six months.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “So you’ll need half a year before producing silver?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan felt awkward. “What is Your Majesty’s meaning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then half a year it’ll be. You have to pay attention to safety when opening up a mine. Don’t throw your lives away just for the sake of the silver,” Ning Xiaoyao said. Though she wished they could get silver the very next day, she’d be a fool to expect the impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, this subject accepts the decree,” Qin Xuan said again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then leave the capital city soon,” Lou Zigui said. “Are the guards you’ve brought with you reliable?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan nodded. “They’ve served my family for generations. I wouldn’t pick anyone unreliable to be my personal bodyguards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then please go,” Lou Zigui half turned towards the door. In the time it took to burn two sticks of incense, Qin Xuan took Qin Xin and left by the side gates of the palace. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You both have to take care, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll go visit you in Jiangnan. Otherwise, you guys can come to the capital. In any case, we’ll definitely meet again. Goodbye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xin said, “This commoner wishes Your Majesty to take care.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “I’ll definitely take care, ah.” Finally, she was living in a world without zombies. If she didn’t live well, she’d be unworthy to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hyaa!” Qin Xuan urged his horse forward. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful on the road!” Ning Xiaoyao shouted at their retreating forms. While on his horse, Qin Xuan turned around to cup his fist at Ning Xiaoyao. Qin Xin perched against the carriage window and looked at her as well, wearing a teary smile. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao told Lou Zigui and Ji Yuerong, “Who said Miss Qin was ugly? Did you see her smile? That was peerless elegance and intellectual brilliance!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong said, “That’s right, Xie Anyi was completely blind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, and he was an idiot, too,” Ning Xiaoyao cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bastard!” Ji Yuerong added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jerk!” Ning Xiaoyao said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme Commander Lou watched the pair as they cursed, feeling helpless amidst it all. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They’re like a pair of sisters~ </span></i><span style>Shadowthunder thought, before he suddenly shivered and smacked himself on the forehead. </span><i><span style>Am I sick of living? What kind of thought was that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Lou Zigui took Ning Xiaoyao and pulled her towards the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll definitely go see them in Jiangnan,” Ning Xiaoyao said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” Lou Zigui replied absently. “There’ll be chances.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao tilted her head at him. “I can tell you’re humoring me just by looking at your face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui tried to raise his lips into a smile. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s too late to smile now,” Ning Xiaoyao pursed her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Lou Zigui, who was beginning to feel weary again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll definitely visit Jiangnan,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Nobody will be able to stop me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“..........” said everyone else. </span><i><span style>None of us are stopping you. </span></i><span style>Meanwhile, Ji Yuerong stepped forward and gave Ning Xiaoyao a few silver drafts. Ning Xiaoyao glanced at them. Each silver draft was worth 100 taels, with a total of five for 500 taels. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Ning Xiaoyao looked at Ji Yuerong, deeply moved. “Yuerong, are you giving me money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not mine,” At that moment, Ji Yuerong didn’t even think it was wrong for Ning Xiaoyao to call her by name. “Yesterday I went to the justice courts and saw one of the Grand Preceptor’s elderly female servants trying to bribe the jailer. I caught her and took the silver drafts. Your Majesty, you should use them instead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuerong, thank you!” Ning Xiaoyao spread open her arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui grabbed Ning Xiaoyao by the collar and murmured next to her ear, “If you hug her, you’ll have to make her into one of your concubines.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao dropped her arms. She couldn’t afford to make jokes like that. Though she didn’t mind either way, Miss Ji might not be able to take it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t I treat Your Majesty to egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>next month?” Ji Yuerong asked. “I’ll buy all the egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>from that stall.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh!” Ning Xiaoyao was extremely moved. She sniffled a few times. “Yuerong, you’re such a good person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong lowered her head to glance at Shadowgale. “Your Majesty, I won’t forget to bring money with me.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Slap--! </span></i><span style>Shadowgale hadn’t said a word today, but he felt the figurative slap on his face loud and clear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, that’s great! “Ning Xiaoyao nodded her head like a chicken pecking at grain, her eyes curved into grinning crescents. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui suddenly found the presence of Ji Yuerong unsightly. </span><i><span style>Why is she so unpleasant to look at? She’s even competing with me to take her out for egg yolk guoba? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Supreme Commander, you have to be logical sometimes too, seriously--</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s that couple in the jail doing?” Ning Xiaoyao asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing much,” Ji Yuerong said, having worked off all her anger. “When I went, that little white flower was crying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In front of His Majesty, you should refer to yourself by--” Lou Zigui wanted to tell Ji Yuerong to use </span><i><span style>‘this subject!’ </span></i><span style>But both Ning Xiaoyao and Ji Yuerong had huddled together at that moment, chatting as they walked on ahead. Judging by their footsteps, they were in an extremely good mood, enough to jump for joy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They still look like sisters~ </span></i><span style>Second Commander Shadowthunder thought again before slapping his forehead once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps the palace will have another imperial concubine soon,” a Dragon Guard whispered to his companion. Lou Zigui shot a glare at him, his eyes as cold as ice. The Dragon Guard nearly peed his pants in his fear. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>These Dragon Guards have been spoiled to the point of indecency by that Miss Ning, </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui silently cursed. He’d need to settle the score with them later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain ran over at this time with a folded booklet in his hands. “Your Majesty, the Grand Preceptor has sent over a booklet admitting his wrongs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whaa?” Ning Xiaoyao accepted the booklet and opened it to read the contents. She had to admit that Grand Preceptor Xie had very fine calligraphy skills. His words were like miniature paintings. In any case, it wasn’t anything she could write herself. (</span><i><span style>Author: You don’t need to compare yourself to the Grand Preceptor for that!</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Shadowrain said, “The Grand Preceptor is asking for an audience outside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao tried her best to read the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>traditional Chinese characters</span></a><span style> on the paper while trying to figure out what the Grand Preceptor was saying between his numerous literary jargon, classical quotes, and pedantic prose. Ji Yuerong didn’t dare to try taking the booklet from Ning Xiaoyao’s hands, but backed away until she was following five steps behind. Lou Zigui saw that Ning Xiaoyao’s face was quickly approximating that of a meatbun and quickly rushed forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” he asked in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao slapped the booklet into Lou Zigui’s hands. “Just what did he write? I don’t understand it at all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale’s face turned black. “The Grand Preceptor had the nerve to fool around with His Majesty?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Between admitting that the Grand Preceptor was fooling around or confessing that she was illiterate, Ning Xiaoyao would naturally pick the former. “That’s right, that old geezer’s trying to provoke me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong and the Dragon Guards instantly looked to Lou Zigui to see if that was the case. Grand Preceptor Xie had written a very heartfelt letter admitting his wrongs, even blaming himself for accepting imperial favor and showing grief over Xie Anyi’s actions. Lou Zigui read the entire thing from beginning to end without finding any faults in it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just say that the Grand Preceptor’s trying to provoke me,” Ning Xiaoyao told Shadowrain. “And that their Xie Clan doesn’t deserve to have that archway. Have the Xie Clan dismantle the thing and return it to me in pieces, I’ll--”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui pulled on Ning Xiaoyao’s sleeve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not done yet,” Ning Xiaoyao shook herself free.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui murmured, “There’s nothing wrong with the contents of this booklet. You can’t use an excuse like that to take back the Xie Clan’s archway.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Then just what did he write?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stared at Ning Xiaoyao. He wanted to make sure that this girl was just joking with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urk,” Ning Xiaoyao dug her fingers into her palms. “I felt nauseous as soon as I saw his handwriting.” His Majesty Ning had found an excuse for her lack of letters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“..........” said everyone else. </span><i><span style>So His Majesty already loathes Grand Preceptor Xie that much!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Wenyuan admitted his wrongs to Your Majesty,” Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao along as they walked ahead. “He’s asked Your Majesty to exile Xie Anyi and née Wang to the borderlands and forbid them from ever setting foot in the capital again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sucked in a breath. “The Grand Preceptor’s that ruthless?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui closed the booklet with a cold laugh. “He has no need for a useless son.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn’t utter a sound. </span><i><span style>The Supreme Commander and Grand Preceptor Xie had a grudge as deep as a sea of blood! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain said, “Your Majesty, will you meet with the Grand Preceptor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Tell him that Your Majesty is busy. Have him go home and keep meditating upon his mistakes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain accepted the decree and ran off. At that moment, a </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>from the empress dowager’s palace arrive and knelt by Ning Xiaoyao’s feet to tell her how the empress dowager had fainted again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What was the reason this time?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>explained how a rock had fallen out of the skies and broke the clothes hanger to Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Tch</span></i><span style>,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “I’ve told her already, my imperial father isn’t willing to see her right now, but she still insists on being so sentimental!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How am I supposed to report these words back to Esteemed Empress Dowager? </span></i><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>was thinking to herself. </span><i><span style>If I tell her verbatim, will Esteemed Empress Dowager die from sheer rage?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If she’s sick, she should see a doctor,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she detoured around the </span><i><span style>mama. </span></i><span style>“Have her take medicine.” </span><i><span style>That Esteemed Empress Dowager should take lots and lots of pills. She’s too good at acting!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>said, “Esteemed Empress Dowager wants to uncover the culprit who threw the rock.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao asked, “When did it happen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A little less than an hour ago,” the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>answered truthfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her chin in thought. It seemed like she’d kicked a pebble about that time. </span><i><span style>Where had it flown again? </span></i><span style>Thinking back to that moment, Ning Xiaoyao’s expression suddenly twisted. </span><i><span style>It looks like I was the culprit.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you guys investigate around the empress dowager’s palace?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>shook her head. “We’ve looked all around the empress dowager’s palace, but we didn’t find any outsiders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale crept forward and whispered, “Your Majesty, none of the Dragon Guards would’ve dared to do such a thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh,” Ning Xiaoyao chuckled. “Then it must’ve been me who did it. I kicked a pebble from the Supreme Splendor Hall, oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“..........” said everyone else. Although Supreme Splendor Hall was far too far away from the empress dowager’s palace, they all had the inexplicable feeling that His Majesty was indeed the guilty party.</span></p>
