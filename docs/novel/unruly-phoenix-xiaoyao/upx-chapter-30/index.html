 <p>Chapter 30: Little sparrow delivers a golden tooth&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gathered crowd had no idea what a wretched plight ruse was, but they could figure it out after thinking it through. It sounded more or less like a self-injury ruse[1. </span><i><span style>self-injury ruse </span></i><span style>(苦肉计) - </span><i><span style>kurouji, </span></i><span style>a strategy where one inflicts injury to oneself to win the confidence of the enemy.].</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Besides,” Ning Xiaoyao felt her idea was reasonable the more she talked. “What does this have to do with the Grand Preceptor? We’re doing it as a show for the populace, aren’t we?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s true, </span></i><span style>thought the gathered men. </span><i><span style>What does this have to do with the Grand Preceptor? </span></i><span style>When everyone believed them instead, who cares what the Grand Preceptor rambled about?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the Grand Preceptor accuses Supreme Commander</span> <span style>of betraying his country then,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “We’ll box his ears!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... …” replied everyone. </span><i><span style>It seemed like His Majesty had a big grudge against the Grand Preceptor.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Are we going to do it this way?” Ning Xiaoyao asked her companions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do it!” Fang Tang was the first to yell. Everyone else looked at Song Jin. </span><i><span style>How about you come up with an idea?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Song Jin said, “Your Majesty, what should your subjects do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll take Supreme Commander</span> <span style>out to stroll around the streets,” Ning Xiaoyao already had her plan in place. “Meanwhile, Windy takes his fellow comrades--eh, Lil’ Big Bro Fang, you guys go too--in different clothing. We’ll sit around and wait for the northern barbarians to charge us and kill Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>.”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s that simple?” Fang Tang asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how else do you want it to go, Lil’ Big Bro Fang?” Ning Xiaoyao replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go to the Fragrant Storey on West Street,” Song Jin spoke up. “Your Majesty can bring Supreme Commander</span> <span style>there, it was where the late emperor often went to mingle with the people incognito. Northern </span><i><span style>Hu</span></i><span style> won’t be too suspicious if Your Majesty goes. They’ll just assume Your Majesty is taking Supreme Commander</span> <span style>to drive away his cares.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Done,” Ning Xiaoyao clapped her hands. “Then I’ll take Supreme Commander</span> <span style>to the Fragrant Storey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this, Shadowgale raised a question. “Your Majesty, what if Supreme Commander</span> <span style>doesn’t want to go? What do we do then?” Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou didn’t look like someone who was good-tempered, much less easy to convince. But Ning Xiaoyao didn’t worry and just waved a hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine. Worse comes to worst, I’ll carry him over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang and the rest all wore odd expressions on their faces. </span><i><span style>Carry him again?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s split up and prepare,” Ning Xiaoyao stood up and gulped the contents of her teacup. She wiped her lips and said, “Meeting dismissed, we’ll leave the palace on time tomorrow night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why nighttime?” a guard asked Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because Windy and the rest are still injured. It’s no good for them to get up early,” Ning Xiaoyao explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale and the rest suddenly felt touched again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Besides, who’s going to murder someone in broad daylight?” Ning Xiaoyao said. It’s not like they were going to kill zombies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... …” said everyone else. </span><i><span style>Why does it seem like His Majesty’s an expert in such matters?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the corridors outside the main audience hall, two </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>[2. </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> (嬷嬷) - a form of address for an elderly female servant, also a wet nurse.</span><span style>] were kneeling to wait for Ning Xiaoyao. When they saw her walk over with her hands behind her back, one </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> hastily spoke up. “Your Majesty, this servant brought Mute Granny over to help you bathe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mute Granny?” Ning Xiaoyao looked at the </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> kneeling behind the first one. “She can’t speak?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This woman who looked to be in her fifties hurriedly nodded her head, opening her mouth so Ning Xiaoyao could see. She only spotted the remnants of a tongue in the mouth. Empress Dowager Xie really was a prudent type, arranging a mute servant to help with her bathing. This way, even if she knew her body was female, this </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>won’t be able to say a thing. </span><i><span style>Mm, </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao mused, </span><i><span style>this mama is probably illiterate too.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She bent down to help Mute Granny up before telling the other servant, “I’m not bathing. You go arrange for the Dragon Guards and Black Frost Cavalry’s generals to bathe instead. The water has to be hot.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>After accepting the decree, the </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> asked, “Then this Mute Granny?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave her here,” Ning Xiaoyao said. If she chased this one away, wouldn’t Empress Dowager Xie just arrange for a second or a third Mute Granny instead? Why make such a fuss?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>took along Mute Granny and left. Ning Xiaoyao pushed open the door to her rooms. As a person with healing powers, all she had to do was activate her ability all over her body and it’d clean up all impurities from inside out. Ning Xiaoyao didn’t need to bathe at all! Right now, Lou Zigui was still sleeping soundly on the couch. The Spring’s evening breeze was soft and gentle as it lightly brushed against Lou Zigui’s hair. Big Boss Black perched on the window to guard his Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>his green eyes narrowed into slits. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao picked up Lou Zigui princess-style and delivered him to the bed, before putting the covers over him and touching his forehead. She exhaled a breath. He wouldn’t need more than two days before his injuries recovered. Big Boss Black ran to the foot of the bed and scratched at Ning Xiaoyao with his paw again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you planning to sleep with him too?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “Wake up, you’re male. Nothing will come of it if you sleep with Supreme Commander!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black made a determined effort to scratch Ning Xiaoyao’s shins. </span><i><span style>This ninny was insulting his adoration for the Supreme Commander! </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao kicked Big Boss Black aside before jumping out the window into the flower gardens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve made your decision?” Grandfather Sparrow was still standing on the same branch as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sat beneath the tree and nodded. “Mm, we’ve decided. We’ll make our move tomorrow night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandfather Sparrow flew to land on Ning Xiaoyao’s crossed legs. “Then how are you going to tell Northern </span><i><span style>Hu</span></i><span style> that Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>’s </span></i><span style>left the palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao conjured out a mantou from a pocket and fed some to Grandfather Sparrow as she explained. “That’s why I want to ask you, Grandfather Sparrow, to help me out. Can you guys steal something from the northern barbarians?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandfather Sparrow gave a start. Did sparrows steal from humans? Were they sick of living?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys just need to lure a northern barbarian to glimpse a view of Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>that’s all,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “When they see the Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>they’ll definitely come to kill him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black quietly approached Ning Xiaoyao’s side. “Then what should be stolen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anything,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “As long as it’s a treasure of the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu</span></i><span style>, it’ll work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandfather Sparrow pecked a few bites of mantou from Ning Xiaoyao’s hand before giving a sigh. “Supreme Commander</span> <span style>is a good person.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao and Big Boss Black both nodded their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll help you on this matter, Xiaoyao,” said Grandfather Sparrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Grandfather Sparrow!” Ning Xiaoyao raised him up and kissed his little head. Grandfather Sparrow hastily flew out of Ning Xiaoyao’s hands. Males and females shouldn’t be so intimate. Did this Xiaoyao understand or not, ah, </span><i><span style>chirp~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to go tomorrow, too,” Big Boss Black said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to fight, what are you going for?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black showed off his claws. “I can scratch those Northern </span><i><span style>Hu</span></i><span style> to death.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s lips twitched. </span><i><span style>If you have the skills, why not scratch the Xie father and daughter to death? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>From outside the walls, the sound of the night watch carried over. A fine drizzle fell from the skies, so Ning Xiaoyao carried Big Boss Black back into the rooms. She placed him on the couch before lying next to Lou Zigui. Since they had to fight tomorrow, she wanted to sleep a bit. When Lou Zigui rolled over, Ning Xiaoyao was in the middle of self-cleaning herself. Her entire body was enveloped in a soft green light. Lou Zigui raised a hand and tightly hugged Ning Xiaoyao, sighing deeply in his sleep. His lips rested on Ning Xiaoyao’s face as if he’d finally found a lost treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... …” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>They couldn’t accuse her of stealing Supreme Commander’s innocence this time, right? Moreover, wasn’t this guy treating her as a body pillow?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The drizzle fell all through the night and next day until dusk. Ning Xiaoyao spent her entire day eating and drinking as she got familiar with Fang Tang and Shadowgale’s crew. Once it got dark, she watched the Dragon Guards and Song Jin’s men leave the palace in casual garb before yawning and carrying the still sleeping Lou Zigui onto the carriage. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Windy, let’s go,” she told the carriage driver.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The general of the imperial guards looked like he’d swallowed </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptis_chinensis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>goldthread</span></a><span style> [3. </span><i><span style>goldthread </span></i><span style>(黄连) </span><i><span style>- huanglian, </span></i><span style>a type of plant used in traditional Chinese medicine to help with stomach problems. Perhaps a certain emperor is giving the imperial guards stomachaches? ;)] when he saw Ning Xiaoyao stick her head out the carriage window. He couldn’t hold back the Dragon Guards, much less His Majesty, from leaving the palace. But how was he supposed to explain things to the empress dowager if they did go?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>’s </span></i><span style>not feeling very well,” Ning Xiaoyao lied without a change in expression. “I’m taking him out of the palace to find a doctor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The general of the imperial guards hastened to reply, “This soldier understands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale struck out with the whip in his hands, and the two horse carriage galloped out of the palace gates. Ning Xiaoyao had just left when Empress Dowager Xie received the news. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty said that Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>’s </span></i><span style>not feeling very well?” Empress Dowager Xie asked the head eunuch who brought in the report.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” the head eunuch replied while half-bowed. “His Majesty brought Supreme Commander</span> <span style>out of the palace to see a doctor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody dared to speak up. If it was an issue of illness, there were physicians on duty at the Imperial Physician Courtyard all day and night. His Majesty hadn’t summoned an imperial physician but went out to look for a doctor. Wasn't this clearly telling everyone that he didn’t trust the imperial physicians or the empress dowager in charge of managing the palace affairs?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie gave a soft exhale as she waved tiredly for the head eunuch to withdraw. She seemed saddened, but there was a cold smile in her heart. </span><i><span style>Lou Zigui’s been poisoned, so of course his body won’t get any better. </span></i><span style>She’d like to see what her daughter looked like after Lou Zigui died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lou Zigui heard the sound of carriage wheels, his eyes flew open in alert. Why would the palace sound like moving wheels? The vision before him was a smiling face that still carried traces of baby fat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Awake?” Ning Xiaoyao grinned at Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miaow,” Big Boss Black greeted, staring at Lou Zigui as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui sat up and glanced at Ning Xiaoyao, then at the interior of the carriage, before asking in a low voice, “Where are we going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fragrant Storey,” Ning Xiaoyao replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Where?” </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui thought he’d misheard. Why would this woman take him to the capital city’s most famous brothel?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought over her words. There was no mistake, Song Jin had said <em>‘Fragrant Storey’</em> last night. “Fragrant Storey, ah.” Ning Xiaoyao said confidently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ridiculous!” Lou Zigui was angry. Did women talk about brothels?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not going?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, we’re going back,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s expression turned wooden. “We’re going even if you don’t want to. Today we have big things to accomplish. All you have to do is flash your face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui had no idea what was going on. Why couldn’t he understand this person when she talked? “Flash my face? How am I supposed to flash it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It means to show your face,” Ning Xiaoyao felt a bit hurt. It was hard to make connections when your language ran along different systems.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Take him to the brothel to show his face? </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui just couldn’t figure out what Ning Xiaoyao was planning!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Fang Tang’s voice called from outside the window. Ning Xiaoyao hastily lifted the curtains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thieving bird!” a guttural voice cried out from behind the carriage, along with a chorus of laughter. A sparrow flew past the window and loosened its claws, depositing a shiny gold object into the carriage. Ning Xiaoyao picked it up and saw, </span><i><span style>aiyah, </span></i><span style>a golden tooth. Though the shape wasn’t as fine as the ones from the apocalypse, it was a tooth beyond a doubt. Chirping noises came from the sparrows atop a wall encircling a nearby house. Ning Xiaoyao spotted Grandfather Sparrow amongst the crowd.</span></p>
