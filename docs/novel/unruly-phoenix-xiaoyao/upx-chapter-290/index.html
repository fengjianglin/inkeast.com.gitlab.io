 <p>Chapter 290: Grand Preceptor says, this is a woman</p>
 <p><span style>“What if I can’t bring myself to curse him?” Even after getting assured by Ning Xiaoyao and being appeased by his big brother, Third Young Master Ning still didn’t have the courage to face the fierce Grand Preceptor Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Ji Yuerong appeared once again in front of Third Young Master Ning.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ning Xiaoluo immediately went to stand behind his big brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Ji possessed a strong military aura and prowess. She cupped fist at First Young Master Ning before she bypassed him and stood in front of Ning Xiaoluo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was wrong, I’m sorry.” Ning Xiaoluo immediately opened his mouth to apologize.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going with you to see Xie Wenyuan.” Ji Yuerong declared as she cast a glance down on Ning Xiaoluo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pulled Miss Ji to the back. She whispered, “Don’t look at people in such a condescending manner. Give Little Luoluo some respect ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Luoluo?” Ji Yuerong looked at Ning Xiaoluo.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ning Xiaoluo didn’t make a sound, His Majesty was even more savage with his beatings. He couldn’t afford to offend him. （╥﹏╥）</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you appear again?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It has already come to this. They are screaming and shouting violence. How could I still play dead?” After pretending to be sisters, acting out a play, and even getting beaten up together, Miss Ji now considered Ning Xiaoyao as a long-time best friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother, can you go with me?” Ning Xiaoluo tugged his brothers sleeve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t let Xie Wenyuan know I’m in the capital.” First Young Master Ning replied, “You’re that scared of Xie Wenyuan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Shadowgale arrived with a set of dragon robe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Put it on,” First Young Master Ning pushed Third Young Master Ning to Shadowgale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale didn’t even ask if Ning Xiaoluo was willing and immediately helped to dress him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ning Xiaoluo couldn’t resist, he had no choice but to put on the dragon robe. His head remained drooped down, allowing everyone else to watch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head. </span><i><span style>Although she may not seem very emperor-like wearing the dragon robe, at least she didn’t look as bad as a quail ah.</span></i><span style> “Why don’t we think of another solution?” Ning Xiaoyao suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Ji questioned First Young Master Ning. “Is he really your blood brother?” </span><i><span style>Aside from looking completely different, Ning Xiaoluo’s courage was the size of a green bean. He wasn’t a young miss, right? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Lift your head.” Ning Xiaomu commanded. He smacked Ning Xiaoluo’s lower back. “Puff out your chest for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Young Master Ning raised his head and puffed out his chest, improving his appearance by a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are going to be inside the palace, right behind you.” First Young Master Ning slightly bent his body and looked straight into Third Young Master Ning’s eyes. In a low voice, he continued, &nbsp;“Xie Wenyuan definitely will not dare to hurt you. Big brother can guarantee this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong quietly asked the soldiers of the Destruction Prisoner Army. “How old is your third young master this year?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is he thirteen yet?” Ning Xiaoyao added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers of the Destruction Prisoner Army: ...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowthunder was uncertain. “I think he’s either eighteen, or seventeen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai ma, already eighteen years old ah!” Ning Xiaoyao lamented. </span><i><span style>She really thought that this Third Young Master Ning hasn’t reached adulthood yet.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Previously when you two were underground, he never mentioned his age to you, Your Majesty?” Shadowthunder asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He may have mentioned it.” Ning Xiaoyao replied, “But I didn’t believe him, </span><i><span style>Eighteen years old</span></i><span style>!? At eighteen years old, Supreme Commander had to raise himself and a platoon of soldiers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers of the Destruction Prisoners Army could only stay silent. </span><i><span style>Their Third Young Master Ning shouldn’t be compared with Supreme Commander Lou, ok!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like he may be a young miss.” Miss Ji quietly insinuated as she stared at Ning Xiaoyao, who was wearing the scattered flower dress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H-he’s not eighteen yet.” one of the Destruction Prisoner soldier finally couldn’t take it any more and blurted. “Our third young master is seventeen this year.”&nbsp;</span><span style>The rest of the soldiers gave him a look. </span><i><span style>Do you think saying Third Young Master Ning is seventeen makes him lose less face?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the seventeen year old Third Young Master Ning rushed towards his big brother and nodded, “I’ll go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Young Master Ning heavily patted his little brother’s shoulders. “Xie Wenyuan is already at death’s door, so there is no need to be afraid of him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo nodded his again. </span><i><span style>Even if he was afraid, it was of no use ah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty,” First Young Master Ning raised his head to look at Ning Xiaoyao. “Please let the Dragon Guards escort Dongfu to the main palace gates.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, sure ya.” Ning Xiaoyao immediately assented.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo was nudged forward by Shadowgale and the other guards. After exiting the Supreme Splendor Hall, he got onto the sedan and travelled to the main gates of the palace. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They could hear shouts of fighting and killing, weapons clanging, and even the sound of arrows being shot through the air. Ning Xiaoluo asked Shadowgale, “If we go out now, are we helping out with the battle?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale ordered the Dragon Guards to put down the sedan chair. After he helped Ning Xiaoluo get off, he replied, “Your Majesty, when they see you, they will stop fighting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo stared at the dragon robe he was wearing. </span><i><span style>Alright. I’m the emperor now</span></i><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty, they are just behind us.” Head Commander Shadowgale walked ahead of Ning Xiaoluo to protect him. He also whispered, “Third Young Master, you don’t have to be afraid. As long as I’m not dead, I’ll make sure to keep you alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t die.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Shadowgale didn’t think that Third Young Master Ning would be concerned about his life or death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you die, His Majesty would kill me.” Ning Xiaoluo complained. “On the other hand, if I died, my big brother would definitely want to kill you. But His Majesty would be able to stop him. Head Commander,” Third Young Master Ning looked at Shadowgale with envy, “Your life is great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale thought about it, and realized he couldn’t say anything to rebut Third Young Master Ning’s words. Also, since this trash almost looked identical to His Majesty, it made Head Commander Shadowgale very angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo turned his head around. </span><i><span style>Where were the people who said they would be right behind him? He couldn’t even see their shadows from here! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Open the palace gates.” Shadowgale ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo was flustered and ogled at Shadowgale. </span><i><span style>We’re opening the gates now?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When the generals of the Elite Imperial Guards in charge of the palace gates noticed Ning Xiaoluo, their hearts relaxed. </span><i><span style>His Majesty was fine. This meant that the past few days they spent guarding the palace gates weren’t for nothing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>With the opening of the gates, the two opposing factions ceased fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.” Shadowgale nudged Ning Xiaoluo to walk forward.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ning Xiaoluo adjusted the collar of the dragon robe. With the attitude of fighting until the very end, he stepped out of the palace gates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you all not going to kneel after seeing His Majesty?” After Ning Xiaoluo’s appearance, all those outside the palace gates were dumbfounded. Shadowgale reprimanded the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it really His Majesty?” At this moment, Elder Li was also outside the palace gates. After seeing His Majesty walk through the gates alive, the old man couldn’t believe his own eyes and asked his followers, “Is that really His Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li’s followers didn’t reply immediately. The crowd also stared at Ning Xiaoluo and asked themselves, </span><i><span style>is that really His Majesty?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s His Majesty.” Eventually, Elder Li confirmed it with his own eyes. </span><i><span style>He was right! The person who walked out of the palace gates is really His Majesty!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li staggered. He wanted to walk up to Ning Xiaoluo.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Grand Preceptor has arrived!” One of Elder Li’s followers pulled Elder Li back and quietly exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being stopped by one of his followers, Elder Li stood up and stared ahead. By now, Xie Wenyuan was already standing in front of Ning Xiaoluo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just imagine, you almost died in his hands. Don’t you want revenge?” Shadowgale quietly whispered to the trembling Ning Xiaoluo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Young Master Ning: ...</span><i><span style>Thinking of that would only make him more afraid ah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” Xie Wenyuan measured Ning Xiaoluo multiple times before speaking. “After not seeing you for a few days, your Majesty has lost quite a bit of weight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo stiffly faced Grand Preceptor Xie. It was true that his face wasn’t as chubby as His Majesty’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re really His Majesty?” Grand Preceptor Xie asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Presumptuous!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Shadowgale and Ji Yuerong came from behind and angrily retorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie didn’t even acknowledge Shadowgale. He sized up Ji Yuerong and demanded, “Where is Lou Zigui?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I should ask Grand Preceptor whether these troops at the palace gates are the rebel troops you plan to use against us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ji lass.” Grand Preceptor Xie’s gazed chilled as he stared at Ji Yuerong. “This old man wants to know whether your Anyuan group of six states have decided to follow Lou Zigui and rebel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re rebelling just because </span><i><span style>you</span></i><span style> are accusing us of rebelling?” Ji Yuerong sarcastically responded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then with the same logic, Ji lass, this old man is rebelling just because you are accusing this old man of rebelling?” Grand Preceptor Xie rebutted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Ji: ...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Ji is not good enough.” Currently, Ning Xiaoyao was peeking from the palace walls. She muttered to First Young Master Ning, “She can’t verbally win against Grand Preceptor.” First Young Master Ning pulled Ning Xiaoyao back. </span><i><span style>If this girl stretches out her neck further, she will reveal herself.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In front of them, Ning Xiaoluo opened his mouth, “I, </span><i><span style>Zhen,</span></i><span style> didn’t die. What are you guys trying to do?”</span><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie scoffed, “His Majesty has learned to use </span><i><span style>Zhen</span></i><span style> already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, Ning Xiaoluo was startled. </span><i><span style>Could it be His Majesty doesn’t refer to himself as Zhen?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Wenyuan.” Elder Li finally managed to walk towards the palace gates with the help of a follower. He looked angrily at Xie Wenyuan. “His Majesty is clearly fine! What are your motives?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty is already dead.” Grand Preceptor Xie crisply enunciated each word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Ning Xiaoluo shouted. “I’m standing right in front of you and you dare to say I’m dead?” </span><i><span style>This old man ought to be killed! </span></i><span style>Third Young Master Ning was outraged. </span><i><span style>How could a person lie through his teeth like this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li walked in front of Ning Xiaoluo and looked him up and down.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Call him old gramps.” Shadowgale whispered to Ning Xiaoluo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old gramps.” Ning Xiaoluo looked at Elder Li with a wooden expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, why.” Elder Li wanted to ask,</span><i><span style> Your Majesty, why must you torment yourself so much?</span></i><span style> But after thinking about it, this wasn’t the right time for this conversation. So, Elder Li turned back to face Grand Preceptor Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are not His Majesty.” Grand Preceptor Xie looked at Ning Xiaoluo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo was trembling. </span><i><span style>This person could tell he was a fraud?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Nonsense,” Elder Li immediately rebutted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder.” Grand Preceptor Xie was not angry even after getting scolded by Elder Li. Instead, he cried in anguish to Elder Li, “This old man watched His Majesty grow up. Wouldn’t this old man be able to tell if this is His Majesty or not? This old man is His Majesty’s maternal grandfather. Why wouldn’t I wish His Majesty to be safe and sound?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li frowned deeply. “Xie Wenyuan, what exactly do you want to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The person standing behind you is not His Majesty.” Grand Preceptor Xie declared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo then thought, </span><i><span style>should he run while he still could, and just escape without caring?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How laughable.” Ji Yuerong icily laughed, “I could say you’re not Xie Wenyuan. Old thing, who do you think you are? You dare to pretend to be Grand Preceptor Xie?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was squatting and picking up stones by the palace wall. She wanted to smash Grand Preceptor to death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just then, Lou Zigui and his troops entered the capital on horseback. They rushed towards the palace.</span><span style>When the common people on the empty streets saw them, they quickly got out of their way. Those who had homes to return to, rushed home. Those who didn’t have homes to return to, fled to hide themselves. The big battle was about to begin and the common people were scared out of their wits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the palace, Ning Xiaomu helped Ning Xiaoyao up and threw away the stones in her hands. “Your Majesty, don’t be angry. Continue watching.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Ning Xiaoyao displayed her annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside the palace, Grand Preceptor Xie pointed at Ning Xiaoluo who wanted to run away. He accused, “This person is someone Lou Zigui found from an unknown place. This old man claims she’s not His Majesty because she is a woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie’s words caused everyone in the vicinity to fall dead silent.</span></p>
