 <p>Chapter 26: Elite troops loyal to His Majesty Ning&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another burst of night winds rose, lifting the handkerchief from Empress Dowager Xie’s hands. Under the eyes of everyone present, it was blown into a lantern stand about half a man tall, where the linen came in contact with the flames and was reduced to ashes. Ning Xiaoyao grinned. This was good, death of the principal witness had destroyed the evidence. Empress Dowager Xie stood up from the ground to stare at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao knew that the empress dowager wanted to bite her death this very moment, but she wasn’t afraid. If she really had the guts, she should turn into a zombie first, and then bite her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui was still standing with support from two generals as he spoke in a low voice. “It looks like Your Majesty fulfilled the last wish of the dead and took back the testamentary edict.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang and the rest were still speechless. This was the first time they’d discovered their Supreme Commander</span> <span style>had the potential to tell tall tales. The ministers and officials exchanged glances. Everything that had happened here had turned into a joke between the imperial mother and son!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Imperial Father only left </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>this one reminder of him,” Ning Xiaoyao was a typical example of someone who showed off their cleverness even after gaining an advantage. “You should have held on tighter to the imperial edict, it would’ve made a good keepsake. None of the ministers got to see it, so what if they accuse </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>of making up lies to cheat them now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These subjects don’t dare,” the ministers and officials hastened to kneel again. Who would dare to accuse the emperor of lying?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie tasted blood in her mouth as she forced a smile. “Such a thing, Your Majesty should’ve told This Dowager</span> <span style>sooner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Oh, Imperial Father’s death caused </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>too much sorrow. My brain was no good, so I forgot to mention it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie narrowly avoided spitting a faceful of blood at Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Were these still human words?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all right, you can all leave now,” Ning Xiaoyao told the gathered officials. “You’re all still loitering around, do you want </span><i><span style>Zhen </span></i><span style>to invite you out for dinner?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>None of the ministers or officials knew how to reply Ning Xiaoyao’s words. If they said His Majesty was joking, he still looked serious when he spoke. If His Majesty wasn’t joking, which one of them dared to ask him to treat them? Weren’t they sick of living then?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really want me to treat you guys to a meal?” Ning Xiaoyao glared. She still hadn’t eaten anything yet! The gyrfalcon was too lazy to peck Ning Xiaoyao again for using “me.” There was no helping His Majesty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A shrewder minister reacted quickly enough to pay his respects. “This subject takes his leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One after the other, the ministers and officials took their leave. Whether or not the royal court would fall into the Xie father and daughter’s hands seemed up to debate again. Now that Lou Zigui was standing on His Majesty’s side, there would probably be another ugly faceoff at the assembly in three days’ time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie allowed Lai </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>to support her out the doors of the Hall of Punishment. When Lou Zigui died from poison three days later, she’d like to see how Ning Xiaoyao could make any waves with just these three to four hundred Dragon Guards. Ning Xiaoyao didn’t speak as she watched Empress Dowager Xie leave, but ran into the courtyard to loosen the Dragon Guard’s bonds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go help,” Lou Zigui told Fang Tang and the rest while he sat down on a flight of steps beneath the eaves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ning Xiaoyao reached the Dragon Guards, she finally realized why none of them had spoken up. All of their mouths had been gagged with cloth. The gyrfalcon gave a cry and flew to the youth kneeling at the head of the crowd. He nuzzled his head affectionately against the man’s face. Ning Xiaoyao felt a little stifled at the sight. This gyrfalcon had abandoned her so naturally; didn’t he feel any reluctance at all? Was he casting her aside after using her? (</span><i><span style>Author: Can you think of something useful instead?</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get to work,” Fang Tang called towards the eunuchs on the side. How could the few of them untie all 300 plus people?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao took out the gag from Shadowgale’s mouth and tossed it aside before asking in concern, “Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale and the Dragon Guards behind him were all currently muddle-headed and ignorant. Their minds were still reeling from the fact that they were all alright after having one foot in the grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gyrfalcon stood cutely on Shadowgale’s shoulder to express his gratitude. “Your Majesty, thank you. I’ll definitely catch you lots and lots of rabbits.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spare the rabbits,” Ning Xiaoyao whispered. What was the point of carrying around a sackful of rabbits? </span><i><span style>Give me money instead, little falcon brother!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale was at a loss. “W-what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing, haha,” Ning Xiaoyao laughed as she pulled him up and rested her hand on his body. One touch was enough to ascertain that this fellow had been tortured, but the injuries weren’t enough to hurt his bones and muscles. He’d be fine after recovering for a few days. After being hauled to his feet, Shadowgale looked blankly as Ning Xiaoyao helped loosened the bonds of Shadowthunder and Shadowbolt[1. </span><i><span style>Shadowthunder...Shadowbolt </span></i><span style>(影雷, 影电) - </span><i><span style>Ying Lei...Ying Dian. Lei </span></i><span style>is thunder, while </span><i><span style>Dian </span></i><span style>is lightning.] on his left and right. After Ning Xiaoyao pulled up Shadowbolt as well, Shadowrain ran over to kneel with a thump.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao hastily jumped to the side and said, “No need, no need to kneel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain’s kneeling awakened Shadowgale to his senses as he fell on both knees as well. Shadowthunder and Shadowbolt had been pulled to their feet by Ning Xiaoyao, but quickly followed suit to kneel in turn. Shadowgale knocked his head heavily against the ground in kowtow as he spoke, “Servant Shadowgale thanks Your Majesty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guards all followed suit to thank Ning Xiaoyao for saving their lives. With 300 people kneeling towards her at the same time, there was no place for Ning Xiaoyao to escape. She gave an awkward smile before saying, “There’s no need to be polite, i-it’s what should’ve been done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her own mother and maternal grandfather were the assailants here, a fact that made Ning Xiaoyao’s ears turn red as she faced the Dragon Guards who’d narrowly avoided death. As Shadowgale knelt on the ground, he still couldn’t fully control his emotions as his body involuntarily shuddered. Ning Xiaoyao reached out a hand to pull him up, this time using enough strength to lift Shadowgale straight off the ground. Next came Shadowthunder, Shadowrain, and Shadowbolt. When she looked up and saw the mass of Dragon Guards littering the courtyard, Ning Xiaoyao gritted her teeth. Slowly, she’d pull them up. Worse came to worst, she’d get everyone on their feet before going to eat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui sat on the steps as he watched Ning Xiaoyao toil along in low spirits to help up the Dragon Guards one by one. Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou knew that from this point on, these Dragon Guards would have a new master. At the same time, Ning Xiaoyao had gained a battalion of elite troops that would obey her without regard to the Xie father and mother pair. Still, Lou Zigui’s face darkened as he watched Ning Xiaoyao pulling these Dragon Guards up and patting their backs. Didn’t this person know that men and women should keep their distance?</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>With effort, Ning Xiaoyao pulled up everyone from the ground and wiped her face before speaking. “All of you go home and rest. I’ll give you guys three days’ break before you come back for work. Uh, your wages will be as before. How does everyone think of my arrangements?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale was about to lead the crowd to kneel again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t!” Ning Xiaoyao’s sharp eyes caught his intention as she shouted out loud. “If you kneel, I’ll have to pull you all up again. That’s exhausting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Pfft,</span></i><span style>” Fang Tang couldn’t hold back a snicker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rest of the Black Frost Cavalry couldn’t resist laughing as they looked at Ning Xiaoyao. A single command would’ve been enough to let the Dragon Guards rise, but this emperor insisted on helping his men up one by one. It made it impossible for the Dragon Guards to dare and get up on their own. All of them could only remain kneeling until it was their turn to be helped up. Why did His Majesty have to take such pains? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale bowed towards Ning Xiaoyao. “Your Majesty, we servants need no rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That won’t do,” Ning Xiaoyao shook her head. “You can’t go to work with injuries. I still have a tough battle to fight at the court assembly in three days’ time. You’re, you’re called Shadowgale, right?” Ning Xiaoyao asked as she peered at Shadowgale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale hastened to reply. “Yes, this servant was bestowed the name Shadowgale by the late emperor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “So your surname is Shadow?” Did such a name exist in the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Family_Surnames" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style>Hundred Family Surnames</span></i></a><i><span style>?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You idiot!” Big Boss Black ran over to Ning Xiaoyao’s feet with a meow. “</span><i><span style>Shadow </span></i><span style>is the assumed name of the Dragon Guards. These 300 guards all have Shadow</span> <span style>in front of their names. Ninny, why don’t you know anything? Miaow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... …” Ning Xiaoyao was silent. Why was this tubby black furball still hanging around?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gyrfalcon cried out. “My master is the leader of the Dragon Guards. My master’s super tough, my master’s…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut your mouth,” Ning Xiaoyao shouted. Fanboys were the most annoying! All of the people in the courtyard gave a start. Nobody had said anything. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After lifting her leg and kicking Big Boss Black aside, Ning Xiaoyao spoke to Shadowgale again. “Take your fellow brothers to rest. We’ll meet again in three days. Windy[2. </span><i><span style>Windy</span></i><span style>(大风) - </span><i><span style>da feng, </span></i><span style>a nickname for Shadowgale. </span><i><span style>Da Feng </span></i><span style>literally means “big wind,” or a lot of wind.], you have to be obedient. Goodbye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned to continue her quest of hunting for the kitchens. She wasn’t in the apocalypse anymore, but her stomach was still starving. This was unforgivable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Windy?” Shadowrain didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he looked towards his big brother. Ning Xiaoyao had long stepped over the tall threshold of the Hall of Punishment and walked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale’s face was wooden. He was the type of person who remained loyal above all else once he recognized a master. Ning Xiaoyao was his master now, so it was fine whether he was called Windy or Rainy or even Snowy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui slowly stood up from the steps. What used to be an effortless move now cost him endless effort. Song Jin ran forward to steady him as he studied Lou Zigui’s complexion. “Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>are you feeling unwell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui shook his head. “Let’s go,” he said in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale walked by Lou Zigui just then, followed by Shadowthunder, Shadowrain, and Shadowbolt. As the commander of the guards, he gave a deep bow to Lou Zigui and said, “Many thanks to Supreme Commander for your assistance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was His Majesty who saved you,” Lou Zigui said softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale didn’t speak, but gave Lou Zigui another deep bow. His body was riddled with torture wounds, so after kneeling to Ning Xiaoyao and bowing to Lou Zigui, his wounds split open again. However, it was hard to see the blood with his black clothes. Lou Zigui was a man of the battlefields, so he clearly caught the scent of blood from Shadowgale’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice lowered further as he spoke, “Don’t go to the Imperial Physician Courtyard. Head to the Supreme Splendor Hall, there’s an imperial physician there who can treat your wounds. I’ll have Fang Tang and the rest buy medicine outside the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale’s eyes flew up to look at Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Empress Dowager isn’t someone who easily admits defeat,” Lou Zigui raised his hand with effort and weakly patted Shadowgale’s shoulder. “Since His Majesty saved you all, he wouldn’t want you to fall into another perilous situation. Go to the Supreme Splendor Hall. Only be staying alive can you serve His Majesty thoroughly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Shadowgale was moved by Lou Zigui’s words. Their lives were cheap, but since such lives were useful for His Majesty, they had to make sure they survived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui had exhausted most of his strength, but mustered up one last breath to speak. “I’ll go back to the Supreme Splendor Hall with you all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale and the rest of the Dragon Guards had been locked up in the dungeons on the night following the late emperor’s burial via the testamentary edict in Empress Dowager Xie’s hands. They had no idea what had happened to Lou Zigui. When Shadowgale heard that he was coming with them, he gave a start. It was already so late. Was Supreme Commander Lou planning to stay overnight at the Imperial Palace?</span></p>
