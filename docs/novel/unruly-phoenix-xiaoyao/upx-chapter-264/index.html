 <p>Chapter 264: The authentication token of the Chen family head&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The curtains of the sedan chair went up before a noble women with willow-shaped brows and phoenix eyes stepped out and looked in their direction.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“My God,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao muttered with a tremulous sigh. “There’s killing intent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong held Xiaoqiu tighter before telling Erya, “When we start fighting later, Erya, you take Xiaoqiu and run as fast as you can.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erya felt that she’d have no sense of loyalty if she fled on the eve of a battle, so she remained uncertain. Ning Xiaoyao added, “Erya, have you turned into a fool? Which one do you think is more worthwhile, two people getting beaten or all four?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think it’s the one with two,” Erya replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not </span><i><span style>I think, </span></i><span style>it’s </span><i><span style>definitely!” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said. “Big bro Windy and the rest are hiding in the end of the alleyway yonder. You should run away with Xiaoqiu and hide over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Née Xu is coming!” Ji Yuerong warned in a soft voice. Ning Xiaoyao examined Lady Xu as she approached them and discovered that even her way of walking took big steps. It was a very valiant and heroic stride.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao breathed in again before tugging at Erya. “Erya, call for mother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mother,” Erya called out fearfully for Ji Yuerong, her voice trembling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Chen estate servants looked even more fearful at the sound. </span><i><span style>Our general has a daughter, too?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Big sis, don’t be afraid of her,” Ning Xiaoyao told Ji Yuerong next. “You and the general already have children. Why are you afraid of that barren thing at all?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Chen family servants looked at Ning Xiaoyao as if they were watching a dead girl. Née Xu’s steps faltered at the comment before she laughed and kept walking forward. Ji Yuerong shot desperate winks in Ning Xiaoyao’s direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s enough if we get the point across. Aren’t you afraid that woman will beat us to death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t even die if someone stabs me, so why would I fear a thrashing?” Since Ning Xiaoyao had decided to risk everything, she was prepared to be beaten half dead by née Xu as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now née Xu had stopped about ten meters apart from the two tall and small figures. “Which family are you from?” she asked. It was a normal question, but sounded high and lofty when asked from those lips. Both His Majesty Ning and Jie Yuerong felt that they’d instantly shrunk in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This little woman’s maternal clan is the Xiang,” Jie Yuerong managed to force out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maternal clan? Sounds like you’re a married woman,” née Xu remarked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao held up her head and threw out her chest. “That’s right, ah. She even has a daughter and son.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Née Xu asked, “If that’s the case, who was your matchmaker? Do you have a marriage certificate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong and Ning Xiaoyao exchanged glances. </span><i><span style>This is going differently from what we expected. Why is née Xu standing there talking to us instead? Isn’t she supposed to beat us up by now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Looks like you have none,” née Xu waited a while before splitting her lips in a grin. “You must have indulged in those relations without a matchmaker at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whaa?” Ning Xiaoyao didn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A runner is only a concubine, you understand things like that, right?” née Xu asked as she looked as Ning Xiaoyao, who only scratched her head. That didn’t sound like a compliment, but </span><i><span style>a runner is only a concubine? A runner was someone who ran, so is she saying women who run will end up nothing more than concubines?</span></i><span style>[1. </span><i><span style>A runner is only a concubine </span></i><span style>(奔者为妾) </span><i><span style>benzheweiqie, </span></i><span style>idiom that roughly means any man who takes a wife without the approval of a matchmaker, or just for a private affair, cannot have that wife officially recognized by either family. She would at most, only be a concubine.]</span><i><span style> What kind of logic is that? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: If you don’t understand it, don’t think up wild explanations, ahhhh!</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you find me for?” née Xu asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gave up on puzzling out the idiom and shrugged her shoulders instead. “Nothing much. I just wanted to tell you, my brother-in-law---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What gall!” née Xu’s expression abruptly shifted at her words. “Who’s your brother-in-law?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen Lu, ah. Who else could it be?” Ning Xiaoyao wore a </span><i><span style>I know you’re playing dumb with me </span></i><span style>expression as she looked at née Xu. “The Grand Preceptor sent his head steward to tell us that my brother-in-law is in Fangqi Lane, and to have my big sister come over with the children.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor?” née Xu didn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, right. Who said my big sister didn’t have a matchmaker?” Ning Xiaoyao suddenly came to her senses. “The Grand Preceptor was the matchmaker between my big sis and my brother-in-law. The marriage certificate is in the Grand Preceptor’s estate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Née Xu looked at Ning Xiaoyao for a moment before she asked, “Who sent you? You’re trying such meager attempts to sow discord in front of this lady’s face?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ji Yuerong.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We’re screwed. We haven’t even started fighting yet and she’s already called us out.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Cheep.” a little mouse’s cry rose up from Ning Xiaoyao’s feet. She looked down and saw none other than Oil Jar. Noticing the glance, he quickly scampered up Ning Xiaoyao’s leg and climbed onto her shoulder, before opening his mouth. Ning Xiaoyao held out her hand and caught a small copper fish. It wasn’t very big, but it </span><i><span style>was </span></i><span style>very heavy. The eyes of the fish were made out of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysoberyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>cat’s eye stones</span></a><span style>. As Ning Xiaoyao ran her finger down the length of its body, she could feel words etched into its scales.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao,” Oil Jar said as he panted, “This is what my Ancestral Grandfather told me to bring you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao quietly backed up a few steps until she was standing behind Ji Yuerong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Ji Yuerong. </span><i><span style>Is His Majesty leaving me to take on the tigress alone, now that we’ve been exposed?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stood behind her and asked Oil Jar quietly, “What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The copper fish of the Chen Clan,” Oil Jar explained. “Ancestral Grandfather had my uncle on my third cousin’s side take it from Chen Lu. Xiaoyao, this is good stuff, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H-how is it good?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the authentication token of the Chen Clan, oh~” Oil Jar explaiend. “Ancestral Grandfather told Oil Jar that anyone who has this is the head of the Chen Clan in Jiangyin County.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, shoot!” The copper fish seemed to feel even heavier in Ning Xiaoyao’s hands. “This fish sounds super important, ah!” She sighed with feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yep,” Oil Jar nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speaking of which, how did that third uncle get this?” Ning Xiaoyao asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen Lu is staying in my third uncle’s house, ah,” Oil Jar explained. “He took it off Chen Lu’s body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah geez,” Ning Xiaoyao sighed again, impressed. This time the third uncle had taken a huge risk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It wasn’t hard at all,” Oil Jar raised a paw to stroke Ning Xiaoyao’s cheek. “My third uncle said that Chen Lu was sleeping like a dead pig.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao brushed a hand across her twitching lips. </span><i><span style>He’s not sleeping. Great General Chen’s almost dead, so that’s more like a coma.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao, my Ancestral Grandfather said that you’d find a use for this, oh,” Oil Jar continued. “I haven’t come too late, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Ning Xiaoyao cocked her head to one side so her chin could nuzzle against Oil Jar’s face. “When you go back, remember to introduce me to your third uncle sometime.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will there be peanuts?” Oil Jar asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“More than enough,” Ning Xiaoyao said haughtily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, okay!” Oil Jar was thrilled as he hopped a few times on her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erya tugged on Ning Xiaoyao’s hand then and whispered, “Big sister Ji’s about to cry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked up and saw that Ji Yuerong was already suffering a crushing defeat before née Xu’s verbal abuse. She hastily had Oil Jar hide in her sleeve before stepping forward to stand shoulder to shoulder with her partner. “Big sis, stop wasting words with her. Even if you pity her, that woman won’t accept your feelings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong wanted to cry, but had no tears. </span><i><span style>Right now it’s her pitying me, alright?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Née Xu only laughed as she looked at Ning Xiaoyao. “Just what kind of thing are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao quickly stuffed the copper fish into Ji Yuerong’s hands. “Big sis, why are you still talking to her? Take out the thing that brother-in-law gave you so she can scram already!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong stared at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let her see,” Ning Xiaoyao said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong relaxed her hand until the golden loop attached to the fish was dangling from her fingertips. The copper fish that had turned pitch-black with age revealed itself before née Xu’s eyes. Her mocking, superior expression immediately shifted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Looks like this is it. Erya, prepare to run,” Ning Xiaoyao instructed Erya quietly. The girl nervously nodded her head and got ready to grab Xiaoqiu and run for the head commander’s hiding place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible,” née Xu muttered to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When my big sister takes this to enter the Chen estate’s gates,” Ning Xiaoyao said with her nose in the air, “You can beat it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is impossible!” née Xu shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong’s face was cold. “Née Xu, I wanted to meet with you on cordial terms since you’re the great general’s consort, but I never thought you’d treat me like this. I have nothing else to say now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Ning Xiaoyao piped in. “Hurry up and get out of here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Chen family servants couldn’t help but think, </span><i><span style>why do these two sisters look so much like they deserve a thrashing?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s Chen Lu?” née Xu demanded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big sis,” Ning Xiaoyoa tugged at Ji Yuerong. “After this, you should have brother-in-law write divorce papers and cast off that woman!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>After this, divorce papers? In other words, Chen Lu isn’t on his deathbed after all? Then all the sadness and alarm I felt, and my plans to die with him, were nothing more than a joke? </span></i><span style>Née Xu stared coldly at the sisters before her. The older one was stunning and gorgeous, while the young one was lively and cute. These pair of fresh blooming flowers was probably where Chen Lu found solace in feminine warmth and tenderness, right? (</span><i><span style>Author: Your suspicions are too intense…</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go snatch those children,” née Xu ordered coldly. “And beat those two sluts to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Ji Yuerong heard those words, she stuffed Xiaoqiu into Erya’s arms and said desperately. “Hurry, go find your father!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erya hugged Xiaoqiu and fled. The Chen estate servants immediately gave chase. Meanwhile, Ning Xiaoyao stood heroically in front of Ji Yuerong and cried, “Big sis, don’t be afraid! I’ve fought before!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Ji Yuerong could reply, the pair of “sisters” were completely surrounded by the other Chen estate servants on all sides. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Throw away the copper fish,” Ning Xiaoyao muttered while fighting off some servants. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong was dedicated to her act, so she faked being kicked to drop the fish from her hands. Quickly, one of the nannies ran forward, picked up the fish, and took it to née Xu’s hands. Under the lantern light, née Xu inspected the item: cat’s eye stone irises, one purple, one green; the Diamond Sutra carved perfectly into its scales, the historical name of the Jiangyin Chen Clan’s head etched in the high backed fins---none of the essential details were missing. This was indeed the Chen Clan’s copper fish token!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give that back to me!” Ji Yuerong cried out in a sad, shrill voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tigress!” Ning Xiaoyao jumped in front of née Xu and prepared to snatch it back herself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said the servants and nannies by née Xu’s side. </span><i><span style>Where did this shameless girl come from?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Née Xu avoided Ning Xiaoyao’s greedy claws and stared at her coldly. Ning Xiaoyao sensed that she was going to get a beating soon. Née Xu raised her hand, and Ning Xiaoyao stood there stoically before the woman slapped her soundly on the face. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh, God.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes were filling with tears as she cradled her cheek.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That hurts! </span></i><span style>（╥﹏╥) </span></p>
