 <p>Chapter 220: Supreme Commander, hurry up and marry Xiaoyao&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sat there blankly while Big Boss Black and Grandfather Sparrow exchanged glances. Then one perched by Ning Xiaoyao’s feet while the other flew to her shoulder to keep her company.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander said before that he’d give me a proper account in the future.” After a long while of sitting, Ning Xiaoyao took the last sugar bean out of her pocket and munched it up. “Is this the promise you guys were talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandfather Sparrow said, “Then when is this future going to come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought it over. “After we kill Grand Preceptor Xie?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then when will you guys be able to kill off Grand Preceptor Xie?” Big Boss Black asked next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao scratched her palms as she shook her head. “I don’t know, ah. The Grand Preceptor’s really powerful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ninny,” Big Boss Black rolled his eyes at her. “Jiao Jiao’s told me multiple times that she’d have sons with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao overlooked the ‘ninny’ comment and asked, “Then did you guys have kittens together yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.” At those words, both Big Boss Black’s whiskers as well all of his his fur all drooped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s mouth twitched. “Looks like Jiao Jiao’s just as hard to catch as Supreme Commander, ha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandfather Sparrow said, “Xiaoyao, you also need to remember that Supreme Commander has a very, very big grudge against the late emperor, your very own father.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ning Xiaoyao. Here was a heartbreaking fact. It wasn’t just her father, but her mother and maternal grandpa who had grudges with Supreme Commander, ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black whispered, “Xiaoyao, it would’ve been better if you weren’t the late emperor’s son.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re saying that as if I wanted to be that stupid bastard’s son,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Ah peh! What son? It should be daughter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t talk about such pointless things,” Grandfather Sparrow flapped his wings at Big Boss Black.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that’s why you shouldn’t be so docile before you figure out what Supreme Commander’s thinking, you ninny. You’re worrying this cat to death, miaow!” Big Boss Black meowed at her. Ning Xiaoyao narrowed her eyes to look out at the flower gardens and suddenly thought of a problem. </span><i><span style>Why didn’t I just show off some of my green healing orbs instead? Why did I try to rely on Big Boss Black instead? </span></i><span style>She whacked herself on the head and realized she had played the ninny once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you hitting yourself?” Big Boss Black asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stood listlessly to her feet. “No reason. Let’s go back. There’ll be egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>to eat later, that’s worth waiting for.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandfather Sparrow nuzzled against Ning Xiaoyao’s cheek with his head before flying off. Big Boss Black jumped up to wrap himself around Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulders as usual. Ning Xiaoyao walked a bit more before whacking herself on the head again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black’s whiskers twitched. “Are you thinking you’re not stupid enough yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve been all tangled up listening to you and Grandfather Sparrow talk,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “The way you guys put it, it sounds like I’ve already given Supreme Commander </span><i><span style>my </span></i><span style>promise or something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black cocked his head to one side and looked at her. “You mean you’re not Supreme Commander’s waifu? If you don’t pair up with Supreme Commander, who else would you pick?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pursed her lips. “Waifu? Have I even married your Supreme Commander yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Big Boss Black. </span><i><span style>She really hasn’t.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who knows what might happen in the future?” Ning Xiaoyao resumed walking. “Let’s think of ways to survive first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black grew a little afraid at her words. “Xiaoyao, are you going to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All humans die eventually,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “Maybe Grand Preceptor Xie will get rid of me, or that Big Boss Xiang will kill me, or the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>will murder me, or even a carriage will run me over and leave me dead when I’m crossing the road.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black grew blank for a long while before he finally managed to asked, “If you die, what will happen to my Supreme Commander?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her chin in thought. The Earth still spun even when people died. Who hadn’t lost family members, loved ones, or friends in the apocalypse? Didn’t everyone just have a cry and find ways to live on all the same? Following that principle, would Lou Zigui stop living just because there was no more Ning Xiaoyao? She found the idea impossible. After figuring things out, Ning Xiaoyao was much more at ease. She felt like a ninny for feeling so uncomfortable back then. There were so many problems to take care of now, so why waste time considering the future? Whether or not they’d live was still a conundrum, to say nothing of forever and ever. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go back and fill our stomachs first,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she raced towards the main palace with a shout. “Chef Huang, I’m coming!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Chef Huang as he made meatbuns in the little kitchen. </span><i><span style>His Majesty’s already hungry again?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black licked his whiskers. Things had developed differently from what he was expecting. Perhaps Xiaoyao wouldn’t even be with Supreme Commander in the future, ah. Now he began to fret about his Supreme Commander---</span><i><span style>if that’s the case, Supreme Commander still needs to work in order to make Xiaoyao his waifu!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao reached the kitchens in the blink of an eye and sat waiting for Chef Huang’s </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%E4%B8%89%E4%B8%81%E5%8C%85%E5%AD%90&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil-Lnwsv_bAhXi6oMKHUhGBAwQ_AUIDCgD&amp;biw=1327&amp;bih=781" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>tri-stuffing meatbuns</span></a><span style> to come out of the steamer. When she saw the two steamers full of tender white buns and counted all 18 pleats on each one, Ning Xiaoyao forgot all about her worries and cares.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One hour later, Lou Zigui entered the kitchen with a bag of egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>and osmanthus honey candy. Big Boss Black stood in front of him and meowed with all his might. “Supreme Commander, hurry and marry Xiaoyao already. Otherwise, she’ll run away with another man! Supreme Commander, you have to keep going and work hard, ah, miaow~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stared at the constantly meowing black cat and said, “You want to eat these? They’re for your owner.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You’re about to lose your waifu but you’re still thinking of gifting her food? No matter how much food I gift Jiao Jiao, she still won’t have kittens with me! This doesn’t have anything to do with food, alright? You’re worrying this cat sick over you two! </span></i><span style>Big Boss Black anxiously ran in circles around Lou Zigui, hating the fact that he couldn’t speak Human.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui circled around Big Boss Black and went straight for the kitchen door. At the same time, Ning Xiaoyao walked out with a meatbun in each hand. Seeing them, Lou Zigui asked, “You’ve already eaten?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her stomach. “It’s fine, I can eat more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the kitchen, Chef Huang stumbled in his steps. </span><i><span style>Could it be that the late emperor never summoned His Majesty to court because he couldn’t afford to raise His Majesty’s voracious appetite? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Have you heard of any emperors who couldn’t afford to feed mouths? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o )</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Want to eat some meatbuns?” Ning Xiaoyao beamed as she grabbed the oilpaper package of egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>from Lou Zigui’s hands while gulping down her meatbuns. With mouth full, she mumbled, “Sheff Hwang’s meat’uns are really tastee, the stuffin’ duzzn’t just have meat, but pamboo shoods and tch’ken too. Haha, tch’ken’s a kinda meat too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>Of course chicken is a kind of meat, is that supposed to be something funny?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Delicious,” Ning Xiaoyao said seriously. Inside the kitchens, Chef Huang felt a sense of inexplicable pride. What was the happiest thing for a chef? Knowing that others recognized his cooking skills. People like Ning Xiaoyao would definitely be favorite customers for every chef, because she found everything tasty and ate them like the most luxurious foodstuffs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui patted Ning Xiaoyao on the head. “I’m not hungry. Tri-stuffing meatbuns can be saved to eat at dinner, as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?” Ning Xiaoyao was amazed. “I didn’t even say their name yet, but you already knew they were tri-stuffing meatbuns?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme Commander Lou could only laugh secretly. </span><i><span style>You’ve already told me the fillings for the meatbuns, so how couldn’t I guess? </span></i><span style>Every time he talked with this girl, they were always on different pages. He just couldn’t figure out why.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yummy,” Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes squeezed in pleasure as she bit the still warm egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You like it that much?” Lou Zigui couldn’t help asking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black ran over and raised his head to meow at Supreme Commander. “As long as it’s food, the ninny likes them all! She was like this when eating meatbuns too! Supreme Commander, you should marry that ninny!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glanced at Big Boss Black, who was sitting by his feet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Otherwise, the ninny will run away with someone else, meow!” Big Boss Black called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao silently raised a foot and dragged Big Boss Black behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on with that cat?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing much, he says he worships you a lot,” Ning Xiaoyao translated carelessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not it!” Big Boss Black wanted to run towards Lou Zigui, so Ning Xiaoyao simply picked him up and threw him over the walls. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now the world is peace and quiet,” she said to Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, the world would be even more beautiful if the Grand Preceptor didn’t exist,” Ning Xiaoyao added, before tossing some osmanthus honey candy into her mouth. “Candy’s good, too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The topic had jumped from Grand Preceptor Xie to osmanthus honey candy, leaving Lou Zigui unable to reply. Was he supposed to talk to her about Grand Preceptor Xie or the osmanthus blossom scented sweets? </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside Grand Preceptor Xie’s study, a teacup went flying to the ground and shattered into pieces, spilling its contents all over the floor. Everyone sitting or standing in the room didn’t dare to utter a word. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tao Yu,” Grand Preceptor Xie spat as he stared at one of his disciples who worked in the military barracks. “His Majesty ordered Tao Yu to lead the troops to East Ji?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The agent nodded his head before adding timidly, “His Majesty also allowed him to take away his faithful subordinates at the barracks. Prince Fu is accompanying him as well, while the soldiers’ grain supplies are being shouldered by the imperial princes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie kept staring at the man, who quickly grew uneasy. Still, there were things he had to say, so he continued, “This is what Lou Zigui said himself. The imperial decree should be coming out very soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie stared at the table before him, which still held a few teacups ripe for smashing. But, this time he simply rested his hand on the table to lightly pat it a few times. Now wasn’t the time to vent his temper, but to find a solution instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would it be Tao Yu?” an official asked. “Instead of using a readily available Lou Zigui, His Majesty sent Tao Yu instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie smiled coldly. </span><i><span style>Lou Zigui’s being kept at the capital to deal with me. Should I give that girl my thanks for treating me as the more serious threat? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: That’s not what His Majesty thought at all….</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does Tao Yu have the ability?” another official asked suspiciously. “Has he ever led troops or fought a war?” Tao Yu might have experienced the military life alongside Tao Chen in the past, but few people knew how he’d really performed. But after the consort-born son Tao Chen became Grand Preceptor Xie’s son-in-law, Tao Yu was forced to suffer under a yoke. Still, if he was completely useless, would Grand Preceptor Xie need to control him in the first place? But now Tao Chen and his entire family were dead, while the people present now were all part of Grand Preceptor Xie’s inner circle. They couldn’t very well make such blatant assumptions, so they only feigned ignorance about it all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One official looked worriedly towards the Grand Preceptor. </span><i><span style>Now that His Majesty’s favoring Tao Yu, wouldn’t Grand Preceptor Xie be thoroughly discredited if that man makes a name for himself out there?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Should Grand Preceptor meet with Prince Fu?” another official suggested. Tao Yu was sure to be loyal to His Majesty now, but did they have a chance to win back Prince Fu, Ning Guangshun?</span></p>
