 <p>Chapter 211: His Majesty says, I don't know how to scold people&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A eunuch loudly proclaimed that court was adjourned in the Hall of Golden Chimes. Outside, Fang Tang clenched and unclenched his fists a few times before striding towards Xie Anji. Although he thought it was completely idiotic to pick a fight with the man on purpose, Fang Tang didn’t dare to disobey Supreme Commander’s orders. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji had a ghastly expression on his face as he stood thinking to himself. He’d not only lost the chance to become Nine Gates Infantry Commander, but even the opportunity to live at the estate and grow his influence there like Gentleman Xu had suggested. And now? When he saw the various officials trailing out from the Hall of Golden Chimes, his face turned green with discontent. He hadn’t even had a chance to step inside the audience hall! </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grand Preceptor?” one of the Grand Preceptor’s men approached his chair after Ning Xiaoyao had left, his voice cautious. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although Pei Yan took the Nine Gates Infantry Commander position, are we going to forget about Second Young Master Xie just like that?” another official piped up quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need to rush,” stated Grand Preceptor Xie simply as he pinched his brows. </span><i><span style>Before I get a full understanding of Pei Yan’s personality, I can’t send Xie Anji over to the Nine Gates Infantry Commander’s estate. This is the only son I have left to carry my expectations. No harm can come to him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Grand Preceptor’s faction wore long faces. </span><i><span style>It’s still not time to rush? Are we supposed to panic </span></i><b><i>after </i></b><i><span style>the Nine Gates Infantrymen and the military barracks all fall into His Majesty’s hands?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie pretended to not notice everyone’s concern and looked towards the spiritless Tao Shidong on the side. “Your Excellency Tao should come back to the Grand Preceptor’s estate with me. I have something to say to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tao Shidong rallied himself to accept Grand Preceptor Xie’s offer. Aside from following the Grand Preceptor to the end, his Tao Clan was left with no other choices now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go,” Grand Preceptor Xie patted his armrests. Two eunuchs approached his chair and lifted it up. They had to carry him out of the Hall of Golden Chimes before the Grand Preceptor’s own retainers could take over the job. At this moment, Ning Xiaoyao’s steps stopped at the side door to the audience hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned to Lou Zigui, who was behind her, and said, “No good, I still feel depressed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Lou Zigui could react, the Lord Protector had already gulped and choked on his spit. He had just witnessed His Majesty slaughtering his way across the hall to crush Grand Preceptor Xie and Tao Shidong senseless. Yet, why was the emperor still depressed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s keeping you down?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When I tossed those parting words in the hall back there, I wasn’t mighty and impressive enough,” Ning Xiaoyao explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowthunder piped up from the side, “Your Majesty, you were just like a god back then, ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A god?” Ning Xiaoyao echoed. “One dashing enough to pierce the Heavens?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” the second commander of the Dragon Guards dutifully nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Just wait and see,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s cheeks puffed up, making her round face resemble a meatbun all the more. “It just sounds like a little kid declaring war. Second Thunder, when you’re facing off with a enemy, would you ever say </span><i><span style>‘hmph, just wait and see?’”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Shadowthunder. </span><i><span style>Did His Majesty just go ‘hmph?’ Or was it just his tone of voice that sounded like a ‘hmph?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rested a hand against his forehead. He could never grasp the main idea behind Miss Ning’s topics, so he didn’t understand what she was so unsatisfied with now. The Lord Protector only asked in a daze, “Then how does Your Majesty think war should be declared?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao considered the question. Back in the apocalypse, people went straight into battle against the zombies. There were no formal declarations of war, so the sayings were commonplace at most. (</span><i><span style>Author: Why are you even thinking about declarations of war in the first place!? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not very good in the art of scolding people,” Ning Xiaoyao admitted her faults openly. “So I need to think further about this question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone fell silent. </span><i><span style>So in His Majesty’s eyes, scolding others is an art…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao clutched her head as she continued forward. There had clearly been a chance for her to be dashing enough to pierce the Heavens, yet she hadn’t taken advantage of it. That made her unhappy. Lou Zigui walked by her side and noticed her face covered with furrows from thought. Unwilling to see her dissatisfied, he strove to cheer her up. “What do you want to eat for lunch later?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever fills me up is fine,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “I don’t have any requirements.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When her followers heard those words, they all felt their hearts inexplicably ache. Lou Zigui couldn’t help but ask, “When have you never eaten your fill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned towards him before letting out a heavy sigh. People’s lives in the apocalypse were harsh, but how could she describe it in mere words? Lou Zigui only looked at the cares creased into her face and decided to ask her more thoroughly when the two of them were alone.</span><i><span style> Had Xie Wenyuan ever maltreated this girl in the past?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah,” Ning Xiaoyao suddenly clapped her hands. In an instant, the downtrodden, dejected girl had transformed into a brilliantly shining beacon. “I know how to make Grand Preceptor Xie sick of living!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately after that, Ning Xiaoyao turned tail and streaked off like smoke. The ones left behind were stuck standing blankly before the Lord Protector asked Lou Zigui, “How is His Majesty planning to make Grand Preceptor Xie sick of living?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The temperatures surrounding Lou Zigui suddenly plummeted five to ten degrees, causing the Lord Protector to feel a chill. Before long, Lou Zigui also turned and ran back towards the Hall of Golden Chimes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong with him now?” the Lord Protector muttered curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan only sneered. “It’s because he doesn’t know what His Majesty’s planning. Let’s go back and take a look as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector still couldn’t figure it out. </span><i><span style>Just because they didn’t know what was going on, Supreme Commander Lou had turned chilly towards us? What for? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the Hall of Golden Chimes, Fang Tang had ended up standing in front of Xie Anji, who looked up at him before detouring out of the way. In response, Fang Tang shifted to the left and blocked his way again. Everyone else felt that something wasn’t right. </span><i><span style>Fang Tang is here simply to make trouble!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re going back just like that?” Fang Tang asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before coming to court, Grand Preceptor Xie had poured earnest exhortations into Xie Anji’s ears. When the good news came to him at court today, he was supposed to make modest remarks and not show off. If bad news came instead, he had to hold himself in check. Faced with a Fang Tang determined to stir things up, Xie Anji just decided to endure it. Again he stepped to the side to avoid Fang Tang. </span><i><span style>I refuse to believe that he’ll hit me outright.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Once more, Fang Tang moved to bar his way with a ridiculing smile. “You’re panicking because you didn’t become the Nine Gates Infantry Commander? Why do you think of nothing but running away at the sight of me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji shot him a cold glare before trying to bypass him again. As a result, Fang Tang began to curse him. Xie Anji’s face turned green as veins popped out on his forehead, but he still ignored Fang Tang. This was the scene that Grand Preceptor Xie happened upon as the two eunuchs carried him out of the hall. It soothed his ruffled mood somewhat. The talents of his second son were limited and inferior compared to his first and third, but he was the best when it came to following orders. With some time and work, Xie Anji might grow into some talents yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang saw that he was on the verge of cursing Xie Anji’s ancestors, but the man still hadn’t drawn his sword to stab him. Now Young General Fang began to grow apprehensive. </span><i><span style>Did Xie Anji have a personality change? Or did someone castrate him yesterday? </span></i><span style>He asked the very question on his mind. “Xie Anji, why are you acting like a housewife? Did someone castrate your thing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji’s steps halted as his fists clenched. Still, he managed to suppress his temper. Last night, his father had explicitly told him not to let His Majesty get another handle on the Xie Clan. It was a sign of gross disrespect to argue or spar with someone on palace grounds, so His Majesty wouldn’t forgive them if that happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty is here,” one of the Grand Preceptor’s allies hastened to report after chancing a glimpse of Ning Xiaoyao hurrying their way. For some reason, Grand Preceptor Xie’s heart inexplicably clenched tightly in his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao had this idea in mind: wasn’t Grand Preceptor Xie afraid that others would see his swollen body and face-like-a-pig? Then she’d pluck off the black veil shrouding his features so everyone could see. (</span><i><span style>Author: This is your so-called idea to make Grand Preceptor Xie sick of living!? </span></i><span style>╮(╯▽╰)╭)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was out of the Hall of Golden Chimes by now. Just as Ning Xiaoyao spotted Grand Preceptor Xie in his chair, she heard Fang Tang mentioned ‘castrate’ and look over. </span><i><span style>Aiya, looks like Lil’ Big Bro Fang wants to fight with Xie Anji. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sniffed and ran towards Fang Tang instead. </span><i><span style>I can’t miss out on a spectacle like that, ah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd all fell respectfully to their knees as Ning Xiaoyao approached, including a very unwilling Xie Anji. Ning Xiaoyao bid the officials rise in her wake as she neared Fang Tang in a small voice. “What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang got up and replied just as quietly back, “Supreme Commander wants me to enrage Xie Anji.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gave Fang Tang an understanding look, before saying, “No wonder I heard you cursing him out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang grew worried. “But he’s not falling for it, ah. What now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glanced at Xie Anji before spreading her arms out helplessly. “I don’t know how to scold people, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, Grand Preceptor Xie had already ordered the two eunuchs to carry him over as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since court’s been adjourned, what are you lot still loitering around for?” Grand Preceptor Xie addressed the officials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji rose and prepared to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spineless thing!” Fang Tang mocked, “Did they really hack your thing off?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t speak nonsense,” Ning Xiaoyao said seriously. “If someone really did that to him, would he even be able to walk now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang was filled with evil intentions as he replied, “Maybe his had been cut off long ago?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t say that, either,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Then where did he get his sons and daughters from? Is he raising children for other men instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!” Grand Preceptor Xie roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s speaking nonsense,” Ning Xiaoyao pointed at Fang Tang while facing Grand Preceptor Xie. “Grand Preceptor, don’t get mad. I’ll teach him a lesson.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said the crowd. </span><i><span style>Are you sure you aren’t teaming up with Fang Tang to curse Second Young Master Xie together?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why isn’t he answering me?” Fang Tang protested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s in a bad mood, of course,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Five or six of the daughters back home all ganged up to ruin another. Their methods are really quite ruthless, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang glanced at Xie Anji clenching his fists repeatedly and nodded. “This official has heard that news as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His own mother even killed off his big brother’s ‘equal wife.’ Heavens, what kind of family are they? Xie Anji,” Ning Xiaoyao looked at the man as she spoke, “I think it’s impossible for you to change your mother at this rate---it’s too late as well---but you should teach your daughters better so they’re less ferocious. That situation’s still salvageable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji tried his hardest to hold onto his threads of reason. “Your Majesty, my father has already sent those girls to the family worship hall to pray to Buddha for the rest of their days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her nose. “Then haven’t you ever heard of the famous saying, </span><i><span style>‘those nearest to the ink turn black themselves?’</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang stole a glance at Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Who was the one who told me they don’t know how to scold people? With one sentence, he condemned all of the Xie Clan daughters. And you still say you have no idea?</span></i></p>
