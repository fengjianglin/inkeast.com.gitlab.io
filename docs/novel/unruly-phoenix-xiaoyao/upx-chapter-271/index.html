 <p>Chapter 271: Beating up His Majesty’s subject’s wife</p>
 <p>“I’m gonna have a chat with Lady Xu.” When Ning Xiaoyao returned to the Supreme Splendor Hall, she quickly changed back into her male attire. She got up to leave before the seat was warm.</p>
 <p>“You’re not going to have breakfast?” Lou Zigui asked.</p>
 <p>Everyone stared at the empty basket of mantous. <i>Supreme Commander, are you sure His Majesty can stuff more in his stomach?</i></p>
 <p>Ning Xiaoyao had a moment of hesitation but ultimately decided, “Nah, I’m not eating. I’m gonna talk about life with Lady Xu.”</p>
 <p>Some of the dragon guards were concerned. “Your Majesty, would Lady Xu resort to violence?”</p>
 <p>Ning Xiaoyao was unruffled. “If she tries to hit me, I’ll just beat her up!”</p>
 <p>Now, everyone including Lou Zigui, felt at ease. &nbsp;<i>His Majesty (Lady Ning）was an audacious fighter! </i></p>
 <p>Ning Xiaoyao invited Lou Zigui. “Supreme Commander, would you like to join me?”</p>
 <p>Lou Zigui gazed at Ning Xiaoyao with his teacup in hand.</p>
 <p>“Well dang, if you don’t wanna go, I’ll just drag Windy with me. If I fail at our talk, another hot guy can continue the convo. Maybe Lady Xu will reassess her life. Ah!” Suddenly, Ning Xiaoyao smacked the table. “I should drag Second Young Master Pei with me!”</p>
 <p>Lou Zigui put down his cup and stood up. “I’ll accompany you.”</p>
 <p>“Deal.” Ning Xiaoyao placed her hands behind her back and walked out with swag. <i>Second Young Master Pei is handsome, but Supreme Commander isn’t bad himself!</i></p>
 <p>“Supreme Commander,” a general dressed in armour ran out of the palace hall and chased after Lou Zigui. “Supreme Commander, what about the deployment of the troops?”</p>
 <p>“Wait until after I return.” Lou Zigui’s tone was cool. Then, he departed with Ning Xiaoyao.</p>
 <p>The general stood there in a daze. <i>Deploying the troops was something that could wait? Anyone else could’ve gone with His Majesty to see Lady Xu! Why must their Supreme Commander be involved?</i> (<i>Author: General, you’ll understand your Supreme Commander’s heart in the future. </i><i>\(╯▽╰)╭</i>)</p>
 <p>----</p>
 <p>In the meantime, Grand Preceptor Xie was in his study listening to the general in front of him. Last night, all the guards at the city gates were killed.</p>
 <p>“This is ridiculous,” the general was furious, “Logically speaking, this should be the Nine Gate Infantry Commander’s doings. But Pei Yan…”</p>
 <p>“He wouldn’t be in charge of something like this,” Grand Preceptor Xie didn’t let the general finish.</p>
 <p>“This old man knows now. Give me the list of names and take some silver taels from my estate for their relatives.”</p>
 <p>The general knelt down and bowed to the Grand Preceptor.</p>
 <p>“Rise,” Grand Preceptor Xie sighed and personally helped the general up. “This old man will transfer the military barracks to your location. You must be extra careful from now on.”</p>
 <p>The general was suffering from an unspeakable bitterness. <i>Would they be fine if they were extra careful? His brothers must have died under a familiar blade. They died because it was an unexpected attack. Who sent the assassins? In the entire city, who has the ability and dares to go against Grand Preceptor Xie? </i>The general had an idea, but didn’t dare to ask.</p>
 <p>“Don’t make assumptions about His Majesty,” Grand Preceptor Xie told the general. “Just do your job.”</p>
 <p>The general lifted his head and stared at the Grand Preceptor. Grand Preceptor Xie wouldn’t mention His Majesty for no reason. His Majesty wasn’t actually hurt. <i>Could last night’s assassins really be sent by His Majesty?</i></p>
 <p>“Go. Remember this old man’s words. Be careful.”</p>
 <p>The general left the study. When he arrived, he was filled with fury. But now, he was filled with instability. <i>Regardless of ranking, more than half of the military officers guarding the city were Grand Preceptor’s men. Based on that alone, it was enough for His Majesty to send assassins to slaughter them. Who knows if His Majesty plans to kill the rest of them? </i></p>
 <p>“Grand Preceptor,” Xu Yiming came out from behind the screen and stood in front of Grand Preceptor Xie’s desk.</p>
 <p>“Last night, someone from His Majesty’s side must have left the capital,” Grand Preceptor Xie wrote on a piece of paper.</p>
 <p>Assistant Xu also took a brush and wrote on another piece of paper. “It could also be Lou Zigui’s people.”</p>
 <p>“For Fang Tang,” Grand Preceptor Xie wrote back.</p>
 <p>“If they wanted to investigate Fang Tang, why did they kill all the guards at the four city walls?”</p>
 <p>Grand Preceptor Xi shook his head and lifted the brush to write. “They think they’re clever. They don’t want us to predict their moves.”</p>
 <p>Xu Yiming wrote on the paper. “We can’t keep Song Xu.”</p>
 <p>Grand Preceptor Xie’s eyes flickered.</p>
 <p>“The longer he remains in Supreme Splendor Hall, the higher the chances he will mess up. Grand Preceptor, if Lou Zigui is prepared and leaves the capital with His Majesty, we won’t be able to forecast the future.” Assistant Xu’s strokes were flying across the paper.</p>
 <p>Grand Preceptor Xie scratched his finger across the table. <i>If he lets Ning Yu go and says His Majesty is dead and that Ning Yu was a fraud this whole time, who would believe him? He has no concrete evidence.</i></p>
 <p>“Your thoughts?” Xu Yiming wrote on the piece of paper.</p>
 <p>“Send someone to investigate Fang Tang,” Grand Preceptor wrote, “If he has already returned to Auyuan, this old man will need to be vigilant regarding the Black Frost Cavalry entering the capital.”</p>
 <p>Xu Yiming wrote down a “yes” on the paper.</p>
 <p>“As for Song Xu,” At this point, Grand Preceptor Xie’s brush paused in mid air. A few moments later, he continued, “If he dies now, it will arise Lou Zigui’s suspicions. Why would the man suddenly die in the palace? How come this old man knows of Song Xu? Assistant Xu, do not underestimate His Majesty and Lou Zigui.”</p>
 <p>Assistant Xu bowed with his hands held in front. “Grand Preceptor, I stand corrected.”</p>
 <p>“It won’t take longer than five days,” Grand Preceptor Xie gestured Xu Yiming to look at his words, “We have to take the risk and let Song Xu live. If anything slips during these five days, then His Majesty and Lou Zigui are destined to thrive and this old man is destined to fail.”</p>
 <p>Assistant Xu held in his breath and revealed a worrisome expression. Deep down, he couldn’t help but feel uneasy.</p>
 <p>Grand Preceptor Xie gave Xu Yiming a look and wrote another two words on the paper. “Don’t fear.” He pointed at the words.</p>
 <p>Xu Yiming bowed and thanked Grand Preceptor Xie again. He tried to reassure himself. <i>Since this involves the imperial power, it’s normal for a commoner like him to be anxious.</i></p>
 <p>Outside the window, Cousin Magpie was stubbornly waiting on the tree branch. He didn’t believe the evil old man Xie and his subordinate could discuss their evil plans without speaking! &nbsp;（o(╯□╰)o）</p>
 <p>Likewise, Xie Laibao was also trying to eavesdrop on the conversation. But since the two were communicating through writing, he barely heard any dialogue.</p>
 <p>“Head steward,” a pageboy ran to report to Xie Laibao. “Great General Chen is creating a scene. He wants to see Grand Preceptor Xie.”</p>
 <p>Xie Laibao turned his head and faced the doors. “Master, Great General Chen calls for an audience.”</p>
 <p>“Let him wait.” Grand Preceptor’s voice echoed from within.</p>
 <p>“Grand Preceptor!” Chen Lu’s voice could be heard through the courtyard. He was shouting himself hoarse.</p>
 <p>“You should see him,” Xu Yiming urged Grand Preceptor Xie. “Lady Xu is a woman. She lacks experience. Don’t be angry over a married woman, Grand Preceptor.”</p>
 <p>Grand Preceptor Xie pinched the space between his brows. <i>His arrow is already on his bow, but side issues keep arising. How could he not have a headache? </i></p>
 <p>“Grand Preceptor!” Chen Lu was still screaming his head off.</p>
 <p>Grand Preceptor Xie ruthlessly slammed on the table and surprised his assistant. “Let him in.” he coldly stated. After venting on the table, Grand Preceptor Xie appeared calmer.</p>
 <p>Lady Xu stared blankly at Ning Xiaoyao, in disbelief. She gradually stood up from her couch. “Y-you’re…..?”</p>
 <p>“Haha,” Ning Xiaoyao laughed, “It’s me.”</p>
 <p>“You!” Lady Xu sized up Ning Xiaoyao from head to toe. She wished her eyes could bore a hole through the body. “You’re not female?”</p>
 <p>“I-I’m not,” Ning Xiaoyao felt sullen after saying this.</p>
 <p>Lady Xu looked up and noticed Lou Zigui standing next to Ning Xiaoyao. She wanted to back up, but the couch was behind her. She had nowhere to go and fell right back down on her seat.</p>
 <p>“Um, sorry?” Ning Xiaoyao apologized to Lady Xu.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” Lady Xu asked glumly.</p>
 <p>“Me? I’m Ning Xiao……”</p>
 <p>Lou Zigui interrupted coldly. “Lady Xu, you are in the presence of the emperor. Where are your manners?”</p>
 <p>Lady Xu was bewildered. <i>This is His Majesty? He disguised as a woman last night? He joined hands with another woman to pretend to be a pair of beautiful sisters? To fool her? </i></p>
 <p>“Can we have a chat?” asked Ning Xiaoyao.</p>
 <p>Lady Xu pointed her finger at Ning Xiaoyao, trembling.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, “ Ning Xiaoyao first apologized, but then rushed to ruin the Grand Preceptor’s name. “But, Lady Xu, Grand Preceptor Xie revealed his true colours last night! He even wants to lock you up! I think he has plans to *<i>Ning Xiaoyao dramatically makes the hand chop gesture</i>* kill you after he imprisons you at his estate!” she exclaimed.</p>
 <p>“You…! Who was the other woman with you last night?”</p>
 <p>If that person also turned out to be a man in disguise, Lady Xu felt like she might as well jab her eyes out. <i>If she’s blind with open eyes, what’s the point of having eyes? &nbsp;</i></p>
 <p>“That was Miss Ji.” Ning Xiaoyao proudly sold out Ji Yuerong.</p>
 <p>“Ji Yuerong?” Lady Xu asked.</p>
 <p>“Mmhmm.”</p>
 <p>“The imperial bodyguard and the pageboys were also impersonated by Your Majesty’s people?”</p>
 <p>“Supreme Commander was the commander officer. The pageboys weren’t ours. They are really Grand Preceptor Xie’s pageboys. Great Preceptor Xie screwed them over.” explained Ning Xiaoyao. “Also, the fire was started by us. Er, we arranged Pei Yan to come ahead of time too. Is there anything else you wish to know, Lady Xu?”</p>
 <p>Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao behind him. He was afraid Lady Xu will go insane and slap her.</p>
 <p>Lady Xu stared at Ning Xiaoyao and then at Lou Zigui. One was His Majesty and the other one was the Supreme Commander. A General’s daughter was also involved. <i>This group of people actually got together to use such shameless tactics to ruin her relationship with Chen Lu? </i></p>
 <p>“We were wrong,” Ning Xiaoyao continued to admit and ruin Grand Preceptor’s name. “But Grand Preceptor Xie is a bad guy too, agreed?”</p>
 <p>“Chen Lu is innocent,” Lady Xu muttered to herself, dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>“Uh, yeah! Although Great General Chen is on Grand Preceptor’s side, he is very loyal towards you! He’s a loyal dog!” beamed Xiaoyao.</p>
 <p>“You’re calling Chen Lu a dog?” Lady Xu stared at Ning Xiaoyao.</p>
 <p>“Not a dog,” Ning Xiaoyao hastily shook her head, “Lady, you must’ve misheard.”</p>
 <p>Lady Xu stood up from her couch. “Your Majesty?”</p>
 <p>“Aye,” Ning Xiaoyao raised her hand to indicate she’s His Majesty.</p>
 <p>“Do you think it’s fun to play tricks on your subject’s wife?” Lady Xu glared at Ning Xiaoyao.</p>
 <p>“How was I playing tricks?” Ning Xiaoyao looked wronged, “I delivered myself and was beaten up by you.”</p>
 <p>Lady Xu recalled how she had repeatedly punched His Majesty in the mouth last night….</p>
