 <p><span style>“That won’t do,” Lou Zigui shook his head. “Your Majesty’s body can’t be casually moved away just like that. It would be impossible for me to let too many people know of your secret, so this is the only solution: burn down the entire palace with your body in it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glared at him. “Think of another way. I’ve said it before, I’ll live and die with this palace!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not what you said before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A palace is a house all the same. What’s wrong with what I said?” Ning Xiaoyao continued to glare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui knit his brows. “In the future, </span><i><span style>I’ll </span></i><span style>pay for the reconstruction of your palace, how’s that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have money?” Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes widened. “Did you say you couldn’t even afford to raise your own soldiers? Were you lying to me?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui knew he couldn’t admit to that even if he died, so he said, “After getting rid of the Grand Preceptor’s faction and clearing up the courts, I won’t be too poor to raise my own troops.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wore a </span><i><span style>‘are you trying to trick me’ </span></i><span style>expression. “We still have to fight Big Boss Ding and the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>after that. Supreme Commander, are you pocketing the money for those expeditions for yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So tell me, where are you going to get the money?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t have any money,” Lou Zigui was forced to admit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care,” Ning Xiaoyao shook Lou Zigui by the neck as she continued to speak. “You can’t burn down the house. You </span><i><span style>can’t burn down the house. </span></i><span style>Wahhhhhh, you can’t burn my house!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s head hurt. He decided to try another idea, or else this girl would never forgive him for burning her house down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to stop burning it now?” Ning Xiaoyao stopped shaking him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Ning Xiaoyao couldn’t help but worry. The man in front of her was a scheming black belly, after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really,” Lou Zigui wrapped his arms around Ning Xiaoyao. “I thought you didn’t want to be emperor, so you wouldn’t care about this palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does not wanting to be emperor have to do with houses?” Ning Xiaoyao glared at him. “Just because it’s not mine, I don’t have to appreciate it? This is a house, ah! Not a piece of paper, ah </span><i><span style>pah, </span></i><span style>ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui found himself rendered speechless by her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You promised you wouldn’t burn the house, ah. Don’t lie to me,” Ning Xiaoyao added worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As a man, a word once spoken cannot be taken back even by a team of four horses,” Lou Zigui vowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pursed her lips. </span><i><span style>Look at him, talking like he’s never cheated anyone in his life. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui saw the motion and knew that Ning Xiaoyao must be having thoughts about him again. He lifted her chin and asked, “What are you thinking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “In any case, you can’t burn down my house.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I leave your body intact, I </span><i><span style>could </span></i><span style>use that to pressure Xie Wenyuan,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But if you do that,” Ning Xiaoyao replied, “The Grand Preceptor will do his best to burn down my house instead, right?” The best way to cleanly get rid of a corpse was to reduce it to ashes, after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui hugged Ning Xiaoyao in silence. In truth, it would be better for his men to set the fire than the Grand Preceptor’s scouts. While his side would only burn a few of the larger palaces, Grand Preceptor Xie could end up submerging the entire Supreme Splendor Hall in a sea of flames. He glanced at Ning Xiaoyao, who was already anxiously biting her nails, and kept his thoughts to himself. Instead, he took her fingers and said, “Alright, I’ll think of a solution.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sniffed, looking rather pitiful. </span><i><span style>If he says he’ll think of a solution, that means Supreme Commander Lou doesn’t have one right now!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I promise you,” Lou Zigui said as he stroked her head with a caox, “I definitely won’t let Xie Wenyuan burn your house down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You make it sound like you never intended to burn my house down either,” Ning Xiaoyao muttered faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>So now I can’t even coax her properly, either?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If he burns my house, I’ll burn his,” Ning Xiaoyao turned vicious. “I’ll burn down the entire Grand Preceptor’s estate!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Lou Zigui agreed immediately. He didn’t mind doing that at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go back and lie down,” Ning Xiaoyao huffed. This time, she really was sacrificing it all! But Lou Zigui just held onto her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me check your injury.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here,” Ning Xiaoyao tilted her neck so Lou Zigui could see. The wound had recovered further, and most of the skin had healed. Lou Zigui felt it with his fingers before lowering his head to softly blow on the spot. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s good that you’re fine,” he said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you ages ago that I was fine,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she looked at him. “Supreme Commander, don’t you trust in my powe---urk, my medical skills?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I trust them,” Lou Zigui laughed. Reality was right before his eyes. Why would he still doubt the truth?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander,” Shen Mu called from outside the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The palace gates are swarming with people. Should this soldier shut the gates?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Has the military barrack’s soldiers arrived?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not yet,” Shen Mu said, “But Elder Li and Xie Wenyuan are standing together and talking about something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut them,” Lou Zigui said simply. Meanwhile, Ning Xiaoyao realized that she’d forgotten yet another detail---to tell Elder Li their plans ahead of time! Completely floored, she couldn’t help but wonder: </span><i><span style>will old gramps beat me to death after he finds out the truth?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander,” General Shen Mu called, “Should you come to the palace gates yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need,” Lou Zigui replied. “After the military barracks soldiers show up, you can send someone to tell me then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Shen Mu obeyed. After a pause, he still asked, “Supreme Commander, how are His Majesty’s wounds?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui didn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing nothing but silence, Shen Mu didn’t dare to ask any more, but simply turned and left. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re doomed,” Ning Xiaoyao said wretchedly once Shen Mu was gone. “Will old gramps bite me to death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He won’t,” Lou Zigui said as he fixed her hair. Ning Xiaoyao’s bun-tying skills were never up to par in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should drop old gramps a word,” Ning Xiaoyao suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need,” Lou Zigui replied. “If we want to convincingly trick Xie Wenyuan, the less people that know about you the better.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s true. So now he’s even hiding the truth from his own subordinates. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyoa rubbed her nose. “Then are you just going to watch old gramps team up with the Grand Preceptor? Let me tell you, ah, old gramps has a strong fighting spirit too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui chuckled and shifted Ning Xiaoyao until he was princess carrying her back to the inner chambers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t regret it when old gramps bullies you,” Ning Xiaoyao warned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui smiled. “He wouldn’t go so far as to hit me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He would have to be able to beat you first,” Ning Xiaoyao was very unsatisfied with Lou Zigui’s current attitude. “Supreme Commander, old gramps is </span><i><span style>fierce </span></i><span style>when he yells at people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not afraid of being yelled at.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If he’s not afraid of that, then Supreme Commander Lou has nothing to worry about, </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao mused silently. </span><i><span style>In any case, it’s not like old gramps can beat him in a fight.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui set Ning Xiaoyao on the bed before sitting next to her. “You should move to a different place to live.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I’ll live and die with my house,” Ning Xiayao sat up and crossed her legs, glaring back at him. “Don’t worry. If it really catches on fire, I’ll escape the flames.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s voice dropped. “Then wouldn’t others see you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll cover up my face,” Ning Xiaoyao said seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s gaze trailed downwards. </span><i><span style>Who else in Supreme Splendor Hall is as short as you? Or runs as fast as you?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked down at herself too, then looked back at Lou Zigui with a ferocious glare. “What do you mean by </span><i><span style>that? </span></i><span style>Are you trying to say my short, flat-chested self is easy to recognize at a glance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui shook his head. </span><i><span style>Although this girl really is short, and her chest not very….never mind. </span></i><span style>He said instead, “I’m only thinking how I have no reason to stay here at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao harumphed. </span><i><span style>He’s obviously trying to humor me. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t want to leave?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not leaving,” Ning Xiaoyao said resolutely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then don’t go,” Lou Zigui followd up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao tugged at her clothes. </span><i><span style>It’s not like I can’t grow taller, either. If I used a little less of my powers, I could grow to staggering heights. You can just look at my own mother. Her genetic makeup is right there as proof. </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: So now of all times, you’ve decided to recognize Empress Dowager Xie as your mother? </span></i><span style>(￢_￢) )</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re not small,” Lou Zigui suddenly spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked up. Instead of being coaxed into a good mood by Lou Zigui, she felt even more depressed. “I know you’re trying to make me feel better, but you can’t take me to be blind, you know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still young, so they’ll still grow,” Lou Zigui could only reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh,” Ning Xiaoyao chuckled. “And if they don’t?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That won’t happen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So if mine don’t grow, you’ll find someone with assets like that Ji Clan girl?” Ning Xiaoyao looked askance at him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What does this have to do with Ji Yuerong? </span></i><span style>Supreme Commander Lou felt another headache coming on. “Nothing like that will happen.” He patted Ning Xiaoyao’s head and said rather ingeniously, “I like you like this. Whether or not you grow, I’ll still like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stopped glaring at him and broke out into a grin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Lou Zigui was feeling a little awkward after admitting his feelings. He hesitated briefly before stating, “I’ll go out and see if the Lord Protector and his brother’s here yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a woosh, Ning Xiaoyao rushed forward and gave him a kiss. “You said it yourself, ah. No matter what I grow into, you can’t go back on those words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui gave a start before breaking into Ning Xiaoyao’s favorite type of smile. “Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar and the sparrow Wheat were both perched on the windowsill when they saw Lou Zigui lower his head to kiss Ning Xiaoyao again. Oil Jar asked Wheat, “They’re about to break out into a fight at the palace gates, so how could Supreme Commander still have time to flirt and romance Xiaoyao?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat was very serious. “Because Xiaoyao is more important, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.” Oil Jar understood. </span><i><span style>Of course kissing Xiaoyao on the lips is more important than the fighting at the palace gates! </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Hey! That’s not a proper comparison!</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The atmosphere is so good,” Ning Xiaoyao said somewhat dizzily. “Why don’t we do it once together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s body stiffened as he released her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao murmured in disappointment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re injured,” Lou Zigui stood up as he said in a soft voice. “I’ll owe you one for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ning Xiaoyao watched Lou Zigui walk away with quick steps, she couldn’t help but pout. </span><i><span style>That’s the first time I’ve heard of anyone owing ‘that’ kind of thing! There sure are a lot of customs I don’t understand in this world. </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Only your Supreme Commander has a custom like that…</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander,” the young Dragon Guard on duty at the door quickly bowed as Lou Zigui emerged. “The Lord Protector and His Excellency Pei have arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good,” Lou Zigui replied. “I’ll go see them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guard hurried to lead the way. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao,” Oil Jar and Wheat each ran or flew to pounce on Ning Xiaoyao once Lou Zigui was gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re here, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao opened her arms to accept them both. “Wheat, why did you enter the palace today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat said, “All the people in the city are saying you’re dead, Xiaoyao. I came to take a look, </span><i><span style>chirp~”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>I’ve only died recently. How come news spreads so fast?</span></i></p>
