 <p>Chapter 203: You might not care, but I do&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So how about it?” Ning Xiaoyao offered her hand to Tao Yu, who simply hung his head and said nothing. Ning Xiaoyao’s hand waited and waited. Supreme Commander Lou had forced this man to a point of no return, so where else could Tao Yu go, if not with her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tao Yu slowly lifted his head and looked at Ning Xiaoyao. “Does Your Majesty still want to use someone who’s betrayed his master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Betrayed his master?” Ning Xiaoyao was astonished. “You’re a general of Yongning. Does betraying the Grand Preceptor count as betraying your master? Hey, hey, General Tao! Can’t you show some respect to an emperor like me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Tao Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although I don’t have the means to kill Grand Preceptor Xie now, he can’t kill me either, right?” Ning Xiaoyao said. “And what’s more, let me remind you of this, general. When you hit someone, don’t go for the face. We’re all aware that plenty of people take the Grand Preceptor as their master, but that’s something we can keep in our hearts. Give this Majesty a bit of dignity and don’t say it out loud, will you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, Lou Zigui had hurried back to the palace and stopped right out the room in time to catch this conversation. Beyond the half-open door, he could see Ning Xiaoyao sitting next to Tao Yu on the same bed, a scene that made his expression turn black. Inside, Tao Yu wanted to laugh at Ning Xiaoyao’s words, but felt that would be inappropriate. They were talking about serious subjects, after all. Ning Xiaoyao had heard Lou Zigui’s footsteps stop by the door, but didn’t turn to look at him. She only stared at Tao Yu because he was more important right now. Sesame Speck and Wheat, who had spotted Lou Zigui arrive from their perch on the window, now chose the time to quietly fly away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scaredy cat,” Big Boss Black muttered from the headboard he glanced with disdain at Sesame Speck and Wheat. </span><i><span style>Is my Supreme Commander really that scary?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tao Yu grasped Ning Xiaoyao’s hand. He had no choice. If he didn’t want to die or become a fugitive pursued by Grand Preceptor Xie’s forces to the end of the world, he could only follow His Majesty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aye,” Ning Xiaoyao grinned. “That’s what I’m talking about! Shake hands, we’ll be good brothers from now on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui knocked once on the door before stepping into the room. Tao Yu gave a start and quickly lifted his head. When he saw that it was Lou Zigui, he immediately glanced at Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Lou Zigui can have an audience with the emperor without being announced ahead of time?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Relax,” Ning Xiaoyao patted Tao Yu’s shoulder. “Supreme Commander’s here to see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stood in front of the bed and stared at the two holding hands before asking, “How long are you guys going to stay like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao was still clueless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black meowed, “How can you hold hands with another man? You’re not guarding your wifely virtues!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui picked Ning Xiaoyao off the bed and set her on a chair somewhat further from Tao Yu before asking, “Why is there blood on your body? Are you injured?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope,” Ning Xiaoyao glanced at her clothes. “It’s not my blood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s your outer robes?” Lou Zigui asked next.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I used them to cover Zhao mama’s corpse. </span></i><span style>When she recalled Zhou </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>again, Ning Xiaoyao’s face fell. The old woman had committed suicide after the empress dowager forced her to her limits, but it was Supreme Commander Lou who’d sent Zhou </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>into the empress dowager’s hands in the first place. She looked up at Lou Zigui, who was standing in front of her, and said, “Zhou </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui had predicted Zhou </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>death amongst his calculations. She was a loyal servant of the empress, so she’d either die from torture or suicide. But when Ning Xiaoyao said it out loud, he felt unwell. Subconsciously, he hadn’t wanted Ning Xiaoyao to see that side of him---his darker self.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there anything you want to tell me?” Ning Xiaoyao asked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s talk outside,” Lou Zigui pulled at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stayed put. “General Tao is one of our people now. Speak what you will.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui couldn’t budge Ning Xiaoyao, so he simply bent down and picked her up in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, dang,” Ning Xiaoyao raised her fists. “I don’t want to go out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui suffered through multiple painful punches from Ning Xiaoyao, but as long as his bones didn’t break, he would still take the abuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Put me down!” Ning Xiaoyao shouted. But Lou Zigui simply calmly walked out of the room with her in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Tao Yu, who’d been left behind. </span><i><span style>Isn’t there something wrong with that picture?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black wanted to chase after them, but suddenly realized that there’d be no one to watch Tao Yu if he left. Thus, he kept his perch on the headboard. His Supreme Commander had expended supreme effort to scheme this man to their side, so he couldn’t let him escape. (</span><i><span style>Author: Enough, you…</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui carried Ning Xiaoyao all the way to the courtyard before setting her down. Ning Xiaoyao leaned against the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulmus_pumila" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>elm tree</span></a><span style> behind her and crossed her arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao,” Lou Zigui strode forward a few steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph,” Ning Xiaoyao snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can explain about Zhou </span><i><span style>mama,” </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui began.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the use of your explanations if she’s already dead?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “Did you have to do it that way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>hates you,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know she doesn’t like me,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “What of it? If it’s not gold, jewels, or money, I can’t love them at first sight, either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You knew?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn it, Zhou </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>looked like she wanted to rush over and bite me to death every time I saw her,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “I’m not blind, why wouldn’t I be able to tell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But you still wanted to keep her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does everyone who hates me have to die?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “Then why isn’t Grand Preceptor Xie dead yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do you want me to do?” Lou Zigui asked.“Zhou </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>already dead. Do you want me to pay for her life with my own?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Ning Xiaoyao glared at him. “You want to threaten me with your suicide now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then Xiaoyao, what do you want to say to me?” Lou Zigui asked in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her nose as her expression twisted. “That’s right, what am I supposed to do with you? What </span><i><span style>can </span></i><span style>I do? It’s not like I can hit you or kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the Grand Preceptor hadn’t surrounded Iron Buddha Temple with his soldiers, the empress and Zhou Junqi wouldn’t have come to beg you for help,” Lou Zigui took off his outer robes and draped them across Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulders. “They’ll think of running away to General Xu Feiyu’s troops.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let them run, ah. My original idea was to let the empress reunite with her General Xu,” Ning Xiaoyao said. That was her ultimate goal. Had she inadvertently made a mistake instead?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about you?” Lou Zigui asked Ning Xiaoyao. “Once they’re home free, what will you do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao blinked. “I’ll keep on fighting against Grand Preceptor Xie and his faction, ah. What else can I do? If the empress and General Xu want to help me, they’re welcome to. If they hate me and don’t want to help, then I’d just drop the matter. You think you can force others to help?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Drop the matter?” Lou Zigui smiled, but his expression was cold. “How can we just drop the matter like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’re you getting at?” Ning Xiaoyao grew a bit nervous. </span><i><span style>Is Supreme Commander planning to off the empress after he’s offed Zhou mama?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If you fulfill their desires, will they accept your good intentions?” Lou Zigui asked in a low voice. “How many truly loyal officials to their sovereigns exist in this world?” If Yongning had its share of them, would the country be reduced to its current state? It was swaying in the midst of a tempest, its common people struggling to even survive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “What you’re saying is, </span><i><span style>‘this isn’t a matter of whether or not we drop the matter, but whether they’ll lead troops to rebel against us instead?’” Please no, I can’t hold off an attack like that!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao,” Lou Zigui said. “Née Zhou married you, then secretly conceived a child with Xu Feiyu…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m the one who’s first at fault,” Ning Xiaoyao cut him off. “I’m the wrong gender to begin with, so we couldn’t be a real husband and wife pair.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re only thinking about that?” Lou Zigui asked. “Alright, let’s not talk about right and wrong. When those lovers did that, where did they put you in their eyes? After entering the palace, née Zhou discovered that she was pregnant. All she thought about was how to protect the baby and lie to you and the rest of the world so her and Xu Feiyu’s baby could be born with surname ‘Ning!’”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s mouth twitched. </span><i><span style>That sounds about right.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s never considered for your sake,” Lou Zigui said as he looked at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not like I’m her true love. Why does she need to consider for my sake?” Ning Xiaoyao shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I have to consider for your sake,” Lou Zigui suddenly spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao opened and closed her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve said it before, I’ll protect you,” Lou Zigui said. “Whether it’s as a man of honor or a base and shameless wretch, I’ll be it all. As long as it can protect you, I don’t care.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was originally in a mood to battle, but Lou Zigui’s words left her absolutely floored. No one was around, so Lou Zigui wrapped Ning Xiaoyao into his arms, his chin restly lighting against her head. In a soft voice, he murmured, “You have to trust me, Xiaoyao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sniffed. Lou Zigui’s body carried the faint, clean scent of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleditsia_sinensis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>Chinese honeylocust</span></a><span style>. “I didn’t </span><i><span style>not </span></i><span style>trust you,” she mumbled back. “But I don’t like it when you hide things from me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I won’t hide anything from you in the future,” Lou Zigui promised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm.” Lou Zigui looked down and kissed her on the forehead. “Don’t be angry anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I,” Ning Xiaoyao wanted to say that she wasn’t mad, but after some thought, decided she couldn’t tell a lie. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui kissed Ning Xiaoyao on the lips as she leaned against the old elm tree. Moonlight cascaded down through its leaves, forming dappled patterns against Lou Zigui’s body. A light-headed Ning Xiaoyao could only think hazedly that summer was really coming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You might not care about some things, but I do,” Lou Zigui whispered by Ning Xiaoyao’s ear. </span><i><span style>That’s why I’ll kill people like Zhou mama again in the future even if you value human lives. </span></i><span style>He hugged Ning Xiaoyao to himself, not expecting her to read between the lines and understand his meaning. There were some things one simply had to do, that’s all. With his back to the moonlight, the figure in his arms was covered in shadows. He couldn’t help but tighten his hold on her as if that would turn her lively again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Mama </span></i><span style>still isn’t back,” Empress Zhou once again returned from outside, her expression growing frightened as she looked at Zhou Junqi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps she met with His Majesty and he’s currently thinking of ideas,” Zhou Junqi had the empress sit as he consoled her. “His Majesty couldn’t possibly think of a solution so quickly when it comes to dealing with Xie Wenyuan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know how much effort His Majesty will expend to save us,” Empress Zhou was still panicky after she sat down. “Will he?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He will,” Zhou Junqi replied. “If he wants the Zhou Clan soldiers, he has to make sure you don’t die, little sister.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Zhou’s hands hugged protectively over her stomach. After a while, she suddenly blurted out, “Let’s still try to find some way to contact A’Xu. I, I don’t, I don’t trust His Majesty very much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to Ning Yu, the empress had more faith and desire to rely on Xu Feiyu. When she saw her brother nod at her, she finally felt calmer. </span><i><span style>If A’Xu can come, then my big brother, the baby, and I will all be free. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Junqi could only inwardly shake his head at his sister. </span><i><span style>If Xu Feiyu really had a way to save us, why would he make you promise to stay by His Majesty over these years?</span></i></p>
