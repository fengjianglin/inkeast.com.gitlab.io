 <p><span style>“Little Gao, did you go to the restroom already?” Ning Xiaoyao asked form the bed. </span><i><span style>He said he wanted to but he still hasn’t gone, isn’t he afraid of peeing his pants?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao didn’t dare to glare at Ning Xiaoyao, so he glared at Chef Huang instead. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to go the restroom, why are you glaring at me?” Chef Huang asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to go anymore,” Imperial Physician Gao said as he continued to glare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can decide whether you want to or not for things like that?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao finally turned towards Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Is now the time to worry about my bathroom preferences?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Hiss~” </span></i><span style>A’Ruan and A’Liang both stuck out their tongues at Imperial Physician Gao, who backed up a healthy distance as he stared at the snakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, he told Ning Xiaoyao, “Your Majesty, this subject will take his leave first. This subject wants to use the restroom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah? Oh, okay,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao turned and fled. Chef Huang wanted to go to the restrooms too, but he still lacked the strength to stand right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That little imperial physician’s afraid of us, </span><i><span style>hiss,” </span></i><span style>A’Ruan told Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao finally understood. Imperial Physician Gao hadn’t wanted to go to the restroom at all. He had just been scared into peeing his pants. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang suddenly pointed outside the window and said with a trembling voice, “Y-Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned and saw Yellow Great Immortal perched on the windowsill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A yellow weasel,” Chef Huang exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao smiled. “That’s Yellow Great Immortal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Chef Huang. </span><i><span style>Looks like His Majesty’s raising this animal too.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright now,” Ning Xiaoyao blew two kisses at Yellow Great Immortal. “Tonight I’ll treat all the little pals to a meal!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow Great Immortal nodded before jumping off the ledge and leaving. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He can---he can understand what Your Majesty’s saying?” Chef Huang stammered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Foolish Fatty,” A’Liang looked scornfully at Chef Huang. “Why shouldn’t we be able to understand human speech?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s why he’s a Foolish Fatty, </span><i><span style>hiss,” </span></i><span style>A’Ruan chimed in with his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That there,” Ning Xiaoyao’s mouth twitched as she petted the snakes’ heads. “Humans really don’t know, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, what are you saying?” Chef Huang asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Foolish Fatty,” A’Ruan mocked Chef Huang before he rose up to nuzzled against Ning Xiaoyao’s cheek. “Xiaoyao, A’Liang and I will be leaving now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmkay,” Ning Xiaoyao nuzzled him back. “Remember to come back with Little Liang Liang tonight for the feast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t call me Little Liang Liang!” A’Liang grew unhappy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, Little Liang Liang,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said A’Liang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang looked woodenly at Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>His Majesty’s talking to poisonous snakes. I didn’t see wrong, His Majesty really </span></i><b><i>is</i></b><i><span style> talking to poisonous snakes! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A’Ruan and A’Liang crawled out the window just as Lou Zigui stepped in. “Supreme Commander,” Ning Xiaoyao waved at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you still wearing those bloodstained clothes?” Lou Zigui walked to the bed and stroked her head, his gaze trailing down towards her neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pursed her lips. “I’m wearing them so the empress dowager could see, ah. Why did you bring her over here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is your neck injury alright now?” Lou Zigui bent down and lifted Ning Xiaoyao’s head for a better look at her neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao tilted her head to one side. “It’s fine, look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skin around the stab wound was still a little red, but it was much better than the hints of pink flesh Lou Zigui had seen before. He gently touched the spot before asking softly, “Does it hurt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head. Lou Zigui straightened up and finally saw Chef Huang sitting on the side. The man wore a bitter expression as he spoke. “Supreme Commander, this one’s legs feel like jelly right now. I can’t---I can’t move.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was stunned. “You’re scared? A’Ruan and A’Liang don’t bite people, ah. Moreover, they’re already gone.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But what’s the difference between Esteemed Empress Dowager and another poisonous snake? </span></i><span style>Chef Huang didn’t dare to voice his thoughts, so he kept quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the future, stay in the little kitchens and don’t come out as you please,” Lou Zigui told him. “If the empress dowager discovers the truth, I don’t need to tell you the consequences. You should know yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang really lost all strength to stand then. </span><i><span style>Then Esteemed Empress Dowager will not only take my life, but grind my bones to dust!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You can leave,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao tugged on his clothes. “Chubs Huang can’t move right now, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui didn’t speak, but simply looked at Chef Huang. Although his gaze was calm and bright without a trace of hostility, a nameless air emanated from his being. Somehow, Chef Huang managed to jump out of his chair and mechanically bow to Ning Xiaoyao before preparing to bolt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui added, “If you see the empress dowager in the future, just know that you’ll be His Majesty’s respected master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang’s legs grew weak again as he almost bowed to Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>You mean to say there might be a next time?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you remember my words?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will our Chubs Huang run into the empress dowager again?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just in case,” Lou Zigui turned back to look at her before patting her head again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang said hastily, “This one will </span><i><span style>never </span></i><span style>let Esteemed Empress Dowager see me again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you do, just tell her that you like to cook with His Majesty,” Lou Zigui said. “A man skilled in martial arts could also be good at cooking, isn’t that right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang wanted to cry, but he had no tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true, hah,” Ning Xiaoyao was suddenly enlightened. “Skilled martial artists can be divine chefs too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This one understands,” Chef Huang replied. Without a chance to struggle free, he could only yield to his fate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Make something for His Majesty that will enrich his blood,” Lou Zigui said, “You’ve worked hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang really did feel that he’d put in massive effort, but he still used self-deprecating words to reply. “This humble one hasn’t worked hard at all. This one will go to the little kitchens promptly and make His Majesty some nourishing soup.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, sure!” With food on the horizon, Ning Xiaoyao could only feel happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang walked out of His Majesty’s bedroom and stared at the courtyard full of summer flowers before his legs gave out beneath him. He plopped on the ground. </span><i><span style>O Heavenly Father, just what did I do, ah…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the rooms, Lou Zigui opened the wardrobe and took out some clean clothes for Ning Xiaoyao to wear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s the bath you promised to draw for me?” Ning Xiaoyao asked while she stripped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui glanced at her undone shirt before quickly turning aside. Ning Xiaoyao stopped stripping. “Are you embarrassed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because things were urgent at the empress dowager’s palace, I went there first just then,” Lou Zigui coughed once. “I’ll go fetch hot water for you now. You should clean yourself up before changing into new clothes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need,” Ning Xiaoyao began, “My body is…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui turned and walked towards the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...already clean,” Ning Xiaoyao finished by the time he was out of the inner chambers. She flopped back onto the bed and pursed her lips. </span><i><span style>All we did was sleep together twice. Does he have to be so shy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black ran in without a word. The first thing he did after jumping on the bed was to inspect Ning Xiaoyao’s neck. Ning Xiaoyao tossed a few more sugar beans into her mouth and said, “The skin’s grown over it already, I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little White went to the empress dowager’s palace to spy on her,” Big Boss Black said as he settled next to her head. “Chubby Yellow and the rest went to the palace gates to keep their eye on Grand Preceptor Xie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Ning Xiaoyao replied, “I’ll treat them to a big feast tonight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine,” Big Boss Black replied, “They had nothing else to do anyways.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hm? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned over and looked at Big Boss Black. “Then you guys aren’t coming to the feast tonight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course we are, miaow!” Big Boss Black said fiercely. “You want to go back on your word again!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Ning Xiaoyao deflated before turning to sprawl on her back again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao, what are you going to do next?” Big Boss Black extended a paw to gently scratch her face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next I’ll have to keep playing dead, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Until Supreme Commander’s Black Frost Cavalry arrives. Then Supreme Commander will kill off the Grand Preceptor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is that Black Frost Cavalry now?” Big Boss Black asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know,” Ning Xiaoyao admitted. “Supreme Commander didn’t say.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you didn’t think to ask him?” Big Boss Black asked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This world doesn’t have Internet or cell phones, so I bet Supreme Commander doesn’t know where they are either. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao scratched her head in thought. “Supreme Commander shouldn’t be sure, either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So are you two just going to wait until the mouse comes out of its hole by itself?” Big Boss Black asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whaa?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t play dumb with this cat,” Big Boss Black grew stern.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That there, Supreme Commander and I would never do something we’re not sure of,” Ning Xiaoyao replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But you don’t know where the Black Frost Cavalry is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where else </span><i><span style>could </span></i><span style>they be? They must be on the road to the capital city,” Ning Xiaoyao said carelessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And if they’re not?” Big Boss Black challenged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then isn’t there the empress and her beloved General Xu’s Zhou Clan troops?” Ning Xiaoyao still didn’t care.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black swished his tail. “The empress hates you so much, would she ever help you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t that because we haven’t talked it out yet?” Ning Xiaoyao’s heart skipped a beat when she recalled how the empress had stabbed her neck with that dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So will the empress still hate you after you’ve talked things out?” Big Boss Black kept asking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t say anything, can you?” Big Boss Black looked disdainfully at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned over again. It was very possible that the empress wouldn’t forgive her even if she died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What now?” Big Boss Black asked. “Maybe you should discuss things with Supreme Commander again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Black Tubby, is there any way to find out the whereabouts of the Black Frost Cavalry?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black licked his paws. “I’ll ask around the city and see if there’s been any cats who’ve come from Anyuan lately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you also find A’Ming’s group as well?” Ning Xiaoyao cupped her hands at him. “He and those wild geese always fly south to north and north to south, they must have plenty of news on them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black scratched Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How come you’re scratching me again?!” Ning Xiaoyao fumed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A’Ming’s group are the geese that fly farthest north,” Big Boss Black said. “They left before summer, didn’t you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao fell silent. </span><i><span style>That’s true. After it gets warm, the geese will all go back north. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This cat has no hopes of you getting any smarter!” Big Boss Black’s fur stood on end at the sight of Ning Xiaoyao. “This cat will take care of things, so you can keep playing dead here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at Big Boss Black. </span><i><span style>I’m always being looked down on by cats for my IQ. Could it be that I’ve really gotten dumber since dying and transmigrating again? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m off.” Big Boss Black jumped off the bed and ran towards the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And the feast tonight?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This cat will be present at the gathering!” Big Boss Black called back.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s just a meal, what’s with ‘present at the gathering?’ </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt the corners of her mouth twitch again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui came back with a giant wash tub. When he saw Ning Xiaoyao, he walked over and drew the covers over her body. “Wait for me a bit longer, I’m going to get some water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmkay,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded docilely. “Can you also bring back a bag of sugar beans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Lou Zigui said softly as he reached out to gently stroke her hair.</span></p>
