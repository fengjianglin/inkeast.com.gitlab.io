 <p><span style>After the sun set and Xie Anyi finished speaking with the imperial physician that was looking after his father, he quickly returned to Grand Preceptor Xie’s bedroom and stood in front of the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father,” he called in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did the person who went to scout for news return?” Grand Preceptor Xie didn’t even ask for his diagnosis, only for updates from the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s back,” Xie Anyi replied. “Half of Prince Zhi’s side courtyard’s been burnt up. The imperial clansmen accompanied Lou Zigui to drink tea at the Tender Fragrance Teahouse.[1. </span><i><span style>Tender Fragrance Teahouse </span></i><span style>(茗香楼) - </span><i><span style>Ming </span></i><span style>means tender tea leaves.] It was impossible to find out what they were talking about, but Prince Zhi has since settled down in his side courtyard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie tugged at his collar, short of breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anyi timidly added, “In other news, His Majesty took the Ji grandfather and granddaughter pair to the Drunken Immortal. His Majesty also captured a woman--father’s mistress.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie’s eyes flew open, and Xie Anyi hastily lowered his head. After a long time, the Grand Preceptor murmured, “Both the Black Frost Cavalry and the Ji Clan soldiers are far away from us. What are you afraid of?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anyi quickly shook his head. “Father, your son isn’t afraid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Xuan will arrive at the city in three days’ time,” Grand Preceptor Xie suddenly changed the topic. “You’ll pick him up personally outside the city then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anyi immediately turned reluctant as he murmured, “Young </span><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/nee" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>née</span></a><span style> Wang is going to the temple in three days’ time to fulfill her vows. She’s still pregnant right now, so son wants to accompany her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie stared at Xie Anyi without saying a word. The eldest son of the Xie Clan couldn’t even hold out for a second before he nodded. “Son understands. I’ll pick up Qin Xuan in three days’ time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty took away all the things in the storehouse,” Grand Preceptor Xie said, “We cannot have any more problems with our businesses in Jiangnan. Don’t offend Qin Xuan during this period.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anyi’s voice was very small. “He’s been docile and obedient all these years, he…” Xie Anyi swallowed the rest of his words when Grand Preceptor Xie kept staring at him. The Grand Preceptor waved his hand to dismiss his eldest son, then sighed as the door closed behind him. He wore an utterly exhausted expression. The current political situation was completely out of his grasp, a constant uncertainty that made him ill at ease. </span></p>
 <p><span style>About an hour later, the Grand Preceptor’s own wife, Lady Wang, came personally to his rooms with medicine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give some things to my eldest daughter-in-law,” Grand Preceptor Xie said after drinking some medicine. “Make sure they’re good things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, this wife understands,” Lady Wang agreed in a low voice. She already knew of the Grand Preceptor’s mistress outside the estate, but she couldn’t show her dissatisfaction in front of him. Her and her Wang Clan all depended on this man’s protection, so no matter how discontent or uncomfortable she felt, she couldn’t let him see.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You may leave,” Grand Preceptor Xie waved his hand as usual. Lady Wang left the bedroom and soon met with her niece from the Wang Clan. This niece was none other than Xie Anyi’s equal wife[2. </span><i><span style>equal wife </span></i><span style>(平妻) - </span><i><span style>pingqi, </span></i><span style>a man’s second wife with the same supposed status as his first and proper one.] younger née Wang. Her stomach was round from her pregnancy, and two servant girls supported her on both sides as she walked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?” Lady Wang quickly had née Wang stop walking and approached her instead. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Young née Wang looked like a fragile, delicate type. Despite this, she glanced at Lady Wang before saying, “Just then, Eldest Young Master told me that he can’t accompany me to the temple three days later. I came to tell mother[3. </span><i><span style>mother </span></i><span style>in this case refers to Lady Wang, who’s her mother-in-law in the Xie Clan despite being her aunt in the Wang Clan.] that I won’t be going, either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Wang patted née Wang’s hand and said lightly, “Endure it for the next few days. That foster son from the Qin Clan’s coming back to the capital city. The Grand Preceptor still has to use him. Do you understand what mother means?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Qin Clan. </span></i><span style>Née Wang lowered her head until the loathing in her eyes faded away, before looking up with a smile. “I understand. Don’t I honor and respect big sister Qin everyday? I can’t force elder cousin to like her if he doesn’t want to, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What ‘elder cousin?’” Lady Wang rebuked née Wang. “You have to call him your husband.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Née Wang stuck out her tongue. Even though she was clearly a married woman and pregnant, she still acted like the young Miss of a household. A </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>in charge of household affairs came by just then to stand respectfully in front of Lady Wang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take some rolls of cloth and gift them to eldest young madame,” Lady Wang said, “Just say that it looks like summer’s around the corner, so she can make a few summer dresses with them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>accepted the command and withdrew, while née Wang lowered her head and refused to speak. Lady Wang lightly stroked young née Wang’s cheek. “It’s only a few rolls of cloth. Why the long face?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Young née Wang immediately changed her expression into a docile smile. “That’s not it. I was just thinking that big sister Qin dresses plainly all year. It’s right to make her a few colorful sets of robes. That way, she’d look more cheerful too, won’t she?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Wang gave a cold snort. The two servant girls waiting on née Wang both understood. Their mistress was nitpicking eldest young madame’s faults in front of Lady Wang again. What kind of mother-in-law liked seeing a daughter-in-law who was gloomy all the time, like she was keeping vigil over a grave? After she finished getting angry at eldest young madame, Lady Wang looked at little née Wang by her side and sighed. If they didn’t have to control the Jiangnan navy, this girl of her Wang Clan would never be an ‘equal wife.’ Equal this, wife that--the name sounded well enough, but what difference was one from a concubine? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll have someone give you some hair ornaments later. There’s a set made from jadeite in the capital and another set that the empress dowager sent to our home. Only two sets exist in all the capital, so mother will give them both to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Young née Wang replied, “I can’t take those. Mother, you should wear them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give them to you,” Lady Wang turned to order her own female servant, “Go to my rooms and take that set of hair ornaments to Cuiyun’s[4. </span><i><span style>Cuiyun </span></i><span style>(翠云) - “jade cloud, emerald green cloud.”] rooms.” This daughter-in-law of hers might lack status, but Lady Wang had always treated her kindly in other matters. Little née Wang wore a tranquil smile. She was filled with delight, but she’d never reveal the fact that she was a shallow, snobbish type who loved wealth. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ning Xiaoyao was in the bedrooms of her own palace, looking over a map. She carefully studied the southern coastline on the map before asking Shadowgale, “So you’re saying that the Xie Clan’s doing business in Jiangnan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao asked, “Then where’s the Jiangnan navy stationed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale pointed at a few locations on the map. Ning Xiaoyao looked over the places before she murmured, “What kind of business is the Xie Clan? How can they afford to raise armed forces numbering in the tens of thousands?” After making some inquiries, she’d found out that the total number of soldiers in the capital city and its environs numbered to 40,000 strong. Even if the Xie Clan got a high salary from the government, they couldn’t raise 40,000 soldiers on that pay alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale shook his head. “This servant doesn’t know. Should we ask Supreme Commander?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need. Have him concentrate on interrogating that Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>woman instead,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “That’s right, has she said anything yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale shook his head again. If the woman had spoken, Supreme Commander would’ve left the torture chambers by now. Ning Xiaoyao studied the map some more. Just then, Shadowgale had pointed out seaports for her. </span><i><span style>Doing business, </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought as she rubbed her chin. </span><i><span style>The Xie Clan probably wouldn’t have any partnerships in their business. Maybe they’re actually smugglers?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” Shadowgale saw that Ning Xiaoyao had spaced out while staring at the map, and shouted at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Windy,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “Three days later we have to grab Qin Xuan and take him into the palace before the Xie Clan does.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This servant understands,” Shadowgale obeyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If he doesn’t want to come,” Ning Xiaoyao added, “Just ask him, </span><i><span style>‘Do you still want Miss A’Xin to find happiness?’ </span></i><span style>I think General Qin will definitely be willing to follow you then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Shadowgale. </span><i><span style>What kind of subject would dare defy a summons from His Majesty? Why do I have to waste words with Qin Xuan? And also, if I say Miss Qin’s name just like that, won’t Qin Xuan beat me up?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, we can’t call a lady directly by her name,” Shadowgale lectured Ning Xiaoyao quietly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao blinked. </span><i><span style>What’s the logic in that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“A lady’s name can only be used by her family members and husband,” Shadowgale added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So I can’t say ‘Yuerong?’” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Shadowgale nodded.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The heck. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wore a </span><i><span style>damn it all </span></i><span style>expression. </span><i><span style>Do women even have human rights here?! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale backed up a step, feeling as if he’d hurt His Majesty’s feelings. After thinking it over, he asked, “Your Majesty’s set your heart on Eldest Miss Ji?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wanted to spit up blood. </span><i><span style>The gender’s all wrong, how am I supposed to have a love affair with her? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale continued, “If Your Majesty takes a fancy to Eldest Miss Ji, you could take her into the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough, don’t say any more,” Ning Xiaoyao raised a hand to stop Shadowgale. If he kept going, she’d spit up blood for real. “You’re a bachelor yourself, so stop worrying about my love life,” she retorted. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Struck in his weak spot, Shadowgale couldn’t say another word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander’s almost beaten that Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>woman to death, miaow!” a cat meowed from outside the window. Ning Xiaoyao turned to see the fat, long furred cat called Little White reporting to Big Boss Black on the situation in the torture chamber. Big Boss Black jumped off the window ledge and ran away. He didn’t want ninny to think that Supreme Commander was a cruel and savage man. Ning Xiaoyao simply turned back to her map. She’d say she’d leave the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>woman to Supreme Commander for interrogating, so what was there to worry about?</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the torture chambers of the Hall of Punishment, Lady Xiang’s skin was covered in injuries. She’d lost consciousness from the torture until a splash of cold water woke her up again, making her let out a wretched cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak,” Lou Zigui said from his seat on the chair. “Does the Grand Preceptor know you’re Northern </span><i><span style>Hu?”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s dog eat dog,”[5. </span><i><span style>dog eat dog </span></i><span style>(狗咬狗) - </span><i><span style>gouyaogou, </span></i><span style>literally “dog bites the dog,” a saying used to insult two opposing sides by claiming they’re both equally vile. In this case, Lady Xiang is equating Grand Preceptor Xie to the likes of Lou Zigui.] Lady Xiang spat at Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Mother,” </span></i><span style>Fang Tang cursed from behind Lou Zigui. “You’ve still got a stubborn mouth? Keep beating her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Treat her wounds,” Lou Zigui said instead. “We’ll stop today’s interrogation here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang grew anxious. “Supreme Commander!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rose to his feet and slapped a hand on Fang Tang’s shoulder, telling him to be quiet. One of the eunuchs in charge of the torture ran out to find a doctor. Lou Zigui walked in front of Lady Xiang and said coldly, “If we let you die, wouldn’t it simply be a release for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Xiang struggled in her bonds, her body already exposed beneath her clothes. She smiled and said, “Supreme Commander’s been staring at my body the entire time. What do you think of my looks?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui smiled back. “Any body that can satisfy the Grand Preceptor’s lower body is naturally a good one. A pity that it’s too dirty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Xiang’s smile faded from her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of the high-status women from Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>would demean themselves to be a spy, much less one who serves the enemy with her body,” Lou Zigui lifted Lady Xiang’s chin and stared into her eyes. “We’ve caught so many spies already, but I never expected a fish to escape our net. Do you think the Grand Preceptor can protect you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what does Supreme Commander want?” Lady Xiang asked. “You want me to testify that Xie Wenyuan’s colluding with the enemy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Would you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha…” Lady Xiang laughed out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll see you again tomorrow,” Lou Zigui released her and told the eunuchs on one side, “From now on, don’t let her get a wink of sleep. Keep her conscious for me the entire time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” the two eunuchs obeyed immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lou Zigui!” Lady Xiang shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme Commander Lou left the torture chambers without turning back.</span></p>
