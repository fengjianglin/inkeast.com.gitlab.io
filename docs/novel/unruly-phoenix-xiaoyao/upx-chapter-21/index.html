 <p>Chapter 21: Supreme Commander and the fatuous ruler&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, Lou Zigui had downed half the bowl of ginseng lily soup into his stomach. Now Ning Xiaoyao was satisfied. She quickly wiped his lips and said, “Do you feel better after eating something? When you’re sick, you have to listen to others.” So speaking, Ning Xiaoyao raised the bowl and polished off the other half herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatuous ruler,” the fearless Lou Zigui gritted his teeth and cursed Ning Xiaoyao again after knowing he’d been played for a fool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An embarrassed Ning Xiaoyao awkwardly lowered her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui felt a warm sensation rise up from his stomach to his chest. Immediately afterwards, he felt his body turn hot and a certain place down there swell until it hurt. “What did you give me to eat?!” Lou Zigui grabbed Ning Xiaoyao’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao’s lost her grip on the bowl as Lou Zigui grabbed her hand. The empty bowl clattered to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the space of these two sentences, Lou Zigui’s entire body felt like it’d been lit on fire. Even his eyes were burning red. Ning Xiaoyao was completely floored. </span><i><span style>This shouldn’t happen! </span></i><span style>Wait, why did she feel like she was burning up?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though Lou Zigui had been matched up with six potential marriages, the first three girls had been born from old, established families and either died from sickness or unnaturally violent deaths. Following that, his next three matches were from ordinary families so that the fourth son of the Lou family could at least have a concubine or two. But all of those girls had sickened and died before the wedding day as well. After the death of the sixth, no families beyond those wanting to sell their daughters for profit were willing to marry into the Lou family. Because the Lou family disdained those families with calculating schemes, and because none of the good families wanted to marry their daughters over, and also because the Lou father and brothers all died on the battlefield before their wives passed away in succession, this Supreme Commander</span> <span style>of Anyuan County had never tasted the flavor of conjugal love between a man and woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui only felt that his body was caught in the midst of a roaring fire that was burning him alive. This wasn’t much better than being sliced to death with a thousand cuts. Feeling hot and dry, Lou Zigui raised his hands to scratch at his own skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t,” Ning Xiaoyao hurried to press his hands down. No matter what happened, he couldn’t flay himself alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood streamed out of Lou Zigui’s nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the middle of treating herself, Ning Xiaoyao hurried to treat Lou Zigui’s “poison” as well. But the spread of the poison was too fast, so her legs collapsed beneath her before she fell on top of Lou Zigui. Pale green light flickered in her palms as Ning Xiaoyao put up a last-ditch effort. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s that scent of grass and trees again, </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui thought as he held onto Ning Xiaoyao. More importantly, as far as Lou Zigui was concerned, he’d held onto the scent that had enchanted him before. He turned over and pressed Ning Xiaoyao beneath his body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s done for...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>These were the last three words to appear in Ning Xiaoyao’s mind before she lost all rational thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>The beaded curtains hanging over the dragon bed changed from violent motion to silent stillness in the amount of time it took to drink half a cup of tea. Ning Xiaoyao listened to the sounds of Lou Zigui’s heavy breathing and foolishly spoke a few words from her medical experience. “Don’t let it weigh on your heart. It’s easy to get excited the first time, but it’ll last longer when you have more experience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s eyes were fixed on Ning Xiaoyao, his drug-ridden red eyes slowly fading back to black. Once the pressure upon him had been relieved, his sluggish expression turned into a mixture of alarm and anger. Ning Xiaoyao boxed herself in the ears. </span><i><span style>Was now the time to talk about how long he lasted?! </span></i><span style>In the apocalypse, any person who took a fancy to another could find a place for them to roll in the sheets together. Humans that existed in a world where death was imminent lived hedonist lifestyles and found joys where they could. Ning Xiaoyao hadn’t found anyone who caught her eye during her 18 years there, but neither had she embraced any high moral principles before. She didn’t think that sleeping together was a big deal. In any case, she didn’t find the sight of Lou Zigui annoying either, and was more preoccupied with how to explain to him about her gender. After finding out she was female, would he just kill her directly?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s gaze shifted from her face downwards before he pulled at her clothes. As they ripped, Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou violently shrank back. </span><i><span style>How could this be?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao scrambled up and prepared to flee. Since she couldn’t fool around anymore, she might as well escape! But Lou Zigui reached out a hand and held her in place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, you’re a female?!” He didn’t dare say it out loud, but asked her in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao darted a glance at Lou Zigui’s naked lower body. Lou Zigui followed her gaze to see the spots of blood on the dragon bed, before his face turned ghastly pale. He then promptly grabbed the covers and wrapped her up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pointed at Lou Zigui’s shoulder and said, “Your shoulder’s bleeding again.” Though their actions just then were short-lived, it was as violent as a battlefield. Even now, she’d yet to close her legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be quiet!” Lou Zigui hissed in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.” Ning Xiaoyao shut her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui spaced out as he lay down. After that bout of self-satisfaction, he currently felt like falling apart. Ning Xiaoyao got off the bed while wrapped in bedcovers and went to look for clothes in a chest. Her pants were dirty and her shirt was torn. Even the bindings across her chest had been ripped in half by that guy on the bed. Ning Xiaoyao rejoiced that Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou had only torn her clothes and not her actual person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui slowly turned his head to look at Ning Xiaoyao. Right now, it was already dark outside the window, and the lamps in the room weren’t lit. Ning Xiaoyao stood in a mass of darkness as she clumsily put on her clothes, trembling in a way that made Lou Zigui feel pity for her sake. After his mental collapse, he’d forced himself to calm down. There were some secrets that only need to expose a thread before the discoverer could use it to weave a cocoon and find out the whole story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Yu [1. </span><i><span style>Ning Yu </span></i><span style>(宁玉) - name of the original owner of Ning Xiaoyao’s body.] was a premature baby born at the Grand Preceptor’s estate from Empress Dowager Xie after she’d asked for permission to leave the palace and visit her parents’ home. A senior monk had asserted through fortune-telling that she and her baby should keep their distance, so the late emperor had left Ning Yu to grow up in the Grand Preceptor’s estate. Before he became emperor, he’d never taken a single step into the palace. Now that he thought back, Concubine Xie had been seven-months pregnant when she used all sorts of ways to get out of the palace and see family despite the risk to her body. Then she had a premature birth, fell severely ill, and gotten her fortune told by a senior monk. In the end, all of this was just a play by the Xie father and mother pair so they could change their imperial daughter into an imperial son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could a female become emperor? Even if Ning Yu could reign for a while, as soon as Ning Xin grew up, she’d become a useless chess piece. Could the Xie father and mother pair allow such a calamity to exist then?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui knitted his brows. If he threw Ning Yu out and exposed her now, he could ruin Empress Dowager Xie and the entire Xie Clan, thus getting revenge for the crown prince. But he hesitated after seeing that lone silhouette moving in the blackness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>After putting on her clothes, Ning Xiaoyao didn’t dare to turn around and look at Lou Zigui, but mumbled, “I want to leave and find some peace and quiet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Lou Zigui didn’t hear her clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was in front of the window within a few steps. She opened it up and jumped outside. Now that Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou knew she was a girl, he’d feel even more strongly that the crown prince had died unjustly. If she didn’t want to be beaten to death, she had to run away!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... …” As Lou Zigui saw Ning Xiaoyao jump out the window like a rabbit, he couldn’t help but feel shortchanged somewhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The ninny changed her clothes!” Wifey Magpie saw Ning Xiaoyao from her branch and spread open her wings to cry out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She smells like she just did naughty business,” Big Boss Black shouted. “This ninny bullied my Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“... …” Ning Xiaoyao was speechless. Did that black furball think he was some loyal dog? </span><i><span style>Wait a minute, </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stared at the four cats in the flower bed. </span><i><span style>What did that long-haired cat say in the side hall? The two bowls were different colors? Cats can only see black, white, and gray, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Is the ninny going to be Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>’s </span></i><span style>wife?” a little sparrow asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black glared hatefully at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned to jump back in the window. In front of Lou Zigui’s stunned stare, she found the dropped bowl that had rolled beneath the bed. It hadn’t broken, so she grabbed it before leaping out the window again. The four cats were still crouched in the flower beds, except now all four were glaring hatefully her way instead of just Big Boss Black.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak,” Ning Xiaoyao gave the bowl to the long-haired white cat. “What color is this bowl?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without the slightest hesitation, the white cat said, “Red.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Life is hard enough as it is, don’t burst my bubble!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao smashed the indigo-blue bowl. She’d actually fallen to ruin via a colorblind cat! Startled by her actions, the cats rushed into the flower clusters. Though they didn’t think much of Ning Xiaoyao’s IQ, they knew as cats that humans were dangerous. Ning Xiaoyao hung her head as she walked out of the courtyard. She might as well find something to eat first and fill her stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When her figure had disappeared, the little kitten asked Big Boss Black, “Will Supreme Commander</span> <span style>marry the ninny?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why does Supreme Commander</span> <span style>have to marry a ninny? Miaow!” Big Boss Black expressed his disapproval. Ever since Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou had saved him from being trampled beneath a horse five years ago, Big Boss Black had treated Supreme Commander</span> <span style>as his benefactor and the best person in the world. Even Jiao Jiao, the female Persian cat in the Ministry of Work’s high official’s estate, wasn’t a good enough match for Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>. </span></i><span style>This ninny Ning Yu wasn’t even as attractive as Jiao Jiao, nor as intelligent, nor as competent. So a ninny like her was even less of an ideal match!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the weasel who had been keeping quiet the whole time spoke up. “Haven’t any of you realized?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Immortal, what do we need to realize?” Big Boss Black asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow Great Immortal blinked his bean-like eyes and said, “The ninny can understand our speech. Just then, she was talking to Little White.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the little animals in the courtyard went &nbsp;Σ(△ °|︴, that really seemed to be the case!</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty.” Fang Tang stood before the doors of the bedroom and knocked, a food box in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the dragon bed, Lou Zigui pinched the area between his eyebrows. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After calling </span><i><span style>‘Your Majesty’ </span></i><span style>a few times without reaction, Fang Tang cried, “</span><i><span style>S</span></i><span style>upreme Commander</span><i><span style>?</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui forcefully covered himself with the covers and sniffed the air. Seeing that the distinctive smell about the bed had faded somewhat, he answered, “Come in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang couldn’t hear the activity that had gone on in the room was preparing to charge in when Lou Zigui spoke. He hastily pushed open the door and stepped inside. Lou Zigui looked up as he stood by the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang held the food box as he examined Lou Zigui’s complexion. “Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>His Majesty’s not here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He jumped out the window,” Lou Zigui replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young General Fang fell silent. </span><i><span style>Why did His Majesty jump out the window?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang quickly raised up the food box for Lou Zigui to see. “Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>the imperial kitchens cooked porridge for you. They even specially stewed sweet soup.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s eyebrows twitched. Sweet soup currently left him with nothing but bad impressions!</span></p>
