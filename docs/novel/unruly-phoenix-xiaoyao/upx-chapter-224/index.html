 <p><span style>At this moment, a gray pigeon flew over Supreme Splendor Hall. When it saw the crowd below him, it resorted to circling the air above them as it called towards Ning Xiaoyao, “Xiaoyao, Wheat told me to pass on a message. Xie Anji’s going to leave by the north gate, </span><i><span style>coocoo~”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao blew a kiss up at the gray pigeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My name is A’Meng,”[1. </span><i><span style>A’Meng </span></i><span style>(阿蒙) - this is also the Chinese spelling for Amon, the Egyptian deity. By itself, </span><i><span style>A </span></i><span style>is a common prefix for nicknames while </span><i><span style>Meng </span></i><span style>means “ignorance, illiteracy, drizzly, hide the truth.”] the pigeon introduced itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sent A’Meng a few more flying kisses in succession. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said everyone else. </span><i><span style>Is His Majesty raising this pigeon as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black couldn’t bear to watch the show of affection anymore and scratched Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bad cat!” the gray pigeon A’Meng cursed him before flying off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rolled her eyes at Big Boss Black before turning back to Shadowgale and the Sect Head. “Let’s head off. That brat Xie Anji’s leaving from the northern gates.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty is certain of this?” the Sect Head asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impudence!” Shadowgale scolded. </span><i><span style>Is His Majesty someone a mere commoner like you can doubt?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s get along now, let’s all get along. Don’t fight each other,” Ning Xiaoyao pulled Shadowgale to stand behind her, before adding to the Sect Head, “Don’t use poison on your own allies, ah. With me here, none of them will work anyway.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said the Sect Head. </span><i><span style>I wasn’t going to use any poisons.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go!” Ning Xiaoyao shouted at the Dragon Guards. Everyone formed a row to face the setting sun as they left the palace on horses headed toward the north city gates. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Xie Anji had left the Grand Preceptor’s estate, where he stopped to kneel down and kowtow three times in front of Grand Preceptor Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go with care,” Grand Preceptor Xie told him. “Remember your father’s words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji stood up. He thought of how defenseless his mother would be now without him at the estate, and braced himself to say, “Father, this son doesn’t know when he’ll come back again. Mother’s health isn’t well, so I ask father to look after her more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie’s expression was cold. “The estate’s full of people. You’re still afraid that your mother will be mistreated?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji was left speechless by his father’s words, so he simply turned to board his carriage. Grand Preceptor Xie watched until the guards and horses were out of sight before telling his steward, “Go send people to follow him until he’s safely out of the city. If anything happens, they should hurry back and report to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The steward accepted the orders before taking along a few retainers to follow Xie Anji’s group on horseback. Grand Preceptor Xie’s two pageboys picked up his chair and turned him back towards the house, just as Madame Mo and her two servant girls approached him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Grand Preceptor Xie asked coldly as he ordered his pageboys to halt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Mo smiled and walked to his side with a bow. “Her ladyship heard that second young master was going to pay a call to a family friend for Grand Preceptor’s sake and wanted to see him one last time. What are your thoughts, Grand Preceptor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie stared at Madame Mo until the smile on her face grew strained, before replied, “Don’t you know that Xie Anji’s already left?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This concubine…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop your petty schemes,” Grand Preceptor Xie said coldly. This concubine was simply telling her that née Wang was making a row about wanting to see her son, thus smearing her name. The minor struggles and plots between jealous women to vie for favor only seemed loathsome to Grand Preceptor Xie now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Mo was left feeling thoroughly embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If anyone else disturbs the peace of this house,” Grand Preceptor Xie said ruthlessly, “This old man will take her life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Mo lost all strength in her legs and crumpled to her knees. The two pageboys carried Grand Preceptor Xie into the estate with his servants following in his wake, leaving Madame Mo behind. Once they were completely gone, she had a servant girl help her to her feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Madame?” another servant girl whispered, “What about her ladyship?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Mo straightened out her hair before replying, “I can only give an answer to her ladyship, what else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, née Wang had already moved from the main courtyard in Grand Preceptor Xie’s estate to a small, no-name residence at the southern end of the estate. The gate to the courtyard wasn’t locked, but the one to her rooms were. Four old female servants sent by Grand Preceptor Xie also took turns in pairs to stand guard over her. When Madame Mo arrived at the courtyard, she simply stood in front of the locked door. None of the servants moved to unlock it for her, but only slid open a slot near the top and announced, “Your ladyship, Madame Mo is here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Footsteps sounded from inside before née Wang’s face appeared at the slot. “Where’s second young master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Mo bent one knee for a bow before replying, “Your ladyship, second young master has already departed. For the sake of passing on your words, this concubine was also scolded by Grand Preceptor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Wang pounded a fist against the door as her voice grew shrill. “He’s already left?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Mo replied simply, “This concubine asks your ladyship to take pity on this concubine and stay at ease in your quarters to nurture your health.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You,” </span></i><span style>Lady Wang could plainly hear the mocking in her tone. “Just </span><i><span style>who </span></i><span style>do you think you are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Mo turned towards the two female servants guarding the door. “If her ladyship has any further business in the future, you should tell the Grand Preceptor directly.” She then turned and left with her servants without waiting for their answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Née Mo!” Lady Wang shouted from inside the house. Madame Mo ignored her shrieks and quickly left the courtyard. The two old servants glanced at Lady Wang through the door. Her clothes were still clean, but the hair she’d combed this morning was already disheveled, and there was a bit of grime on her face. As she stood in front of the door and pounded on the wood, they could hear her cursing Madame Mo while begging Grand Preceptor Xie for forgiveness. But soon enough, née Wang’s speech had devolved into incoherent mumbling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two servants exchanged worried glances. </span><i><span style>If they keep her locked up like this, her ladyship might really go insane.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Madame, will there be trouble for you in the future after talking to her ladyship like that?” the servant on Madame Mo’s left asked quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Mo only smiled. “Her ladyship won’t resign herself to her fate. She thinks that I don’t know that she’s already sent for help from her maternal clan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two servant girls gave a start at the news. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then the Wang Clan?” the servant girl on her right quickly questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Mo only grinned and shook her head, her voice soft. “She’s a woman who even murdered her own niece. Would the Wang Clan come save her just to see her hurt their own family members again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two servant girls fell silent at the words. Although Lady Wang was pitiful now, even pathetic people had their hateful sides. When her ladyship was in power, many had suffered under her hands. Meanwhile, Madame Mo kept walking towards her courtyard. Lady Wang had given birth to three sons, but now only Xie Anji, the most useless one, was left. Perhaps Heaven had finally opened its eyes to her. Although her own son was concubine-born, he would still have a chance to rise if Xie Anji couldn’t support the family on his shoulders. Then their days could only improve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the study, the Grand Preceptor’s aide, Xu Yiming, bowed as he reported, “Grand Preceptor, the people in the army have already been arranged. Does Grand Preceptor want to see him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir has explained everything to them?” Grand Preceptor Xie asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Yiming replied, “Only the routes that the troops will take. That wasn’t very difficult.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie nodded. East Ji was full of mountains, so as long as the rebel bands set strategic ambushes for General Tao Yu’s army along the way, they’d be sure to win.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does the Grand Preceptor want to grant him an audience?” Xu Yiming asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait until after Anji leaves the city,” Grand Preceptor Xie said. “As long as he can make it out safely, this old man will be free to act as I like.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grand Preceptor is still worried that something might go wrong?” Xu Yiming asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie’s face broke into a bitter smile. “Too many things have gone wrong recently. This old man isn’t sure whether this time will go the same way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Second young master departed in complete secrecy. If he hadn’t passed by her ladyship’s courtyard to kowtow, she never would have known he was leaving,” Xu Yiming replied. “It’s impossible for His Majesty to know, either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie believed the same thing, but he still couldn’t be absolutely </span><i><span style>certain. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hour later found Ning Xiaoyao and her men blocking the public road outside of the north gates as Xie Anji’s caravan departed the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” Ning Xiaoyao stuffed the last pieces of her apple into her mouth before puffing out her cheeks. “Just where are you lot all going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Grand Preceptor’s men saw Ning Xiaoyao as their expressions turned blank. </span><i><span style>Why is he here?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji emerged from his carriage and felt his vision start to go black at the sight of Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Isn’t this Xie Anji? Hello, second uncle.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Screw you and your ‘second uncle!’ </span></i><span style>Xie Anji wanted to curse, but he knew he was no match for Ning Xiaoyao’s words if even his father couldn’t beat him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve seen His Majesty, but you’re still not kneeling?” Shadowgale yelled at Xie Anji.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Grand Preceptor estate’s men didn’t even know what to do at this moment, so all of them looked towards Xie Anji. Yan Hong took this chance to move closer to Ning Xiaoyao and murmured, “Your Majesty, there are denizens of the </span><i><span style>jianghu </span></i><span style>in that crowd. Their martial skills aren’t half bad, so Your Majesty needs to be careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned towards Yan Hong. The woman wasn’t very tall, but she noticed the female’s perky chest at first glance. </span><i><span style>Damn it, how did she grow them? </span></i><span style>A flash of jealousy rose in her breast before Ning Xiaoyao said, “No worries, I can fight, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yan Hong only looked at Ning Xiaoyao with an indulgent smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, stop grinning,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Don’t try to seduce me with your smile.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Yan Hong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speaking of which, how’d you get a chest that big for your height?” Ning Xiaoyao cocked her head at Yan Hong as she murmured. “Can you tell me about it?” If she knew the secret, she could try it out herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yan Hong was an experienced woman of the world, but Ning Xiaoyao’s words were enough to turn her face red. She never thought His Majesty could be so lecherous despite still looking like a child. (</span><i><span style>Author: She’s asking for her own sake…</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t say?” Ning Xiaoyao pressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This young woman was born this way, ah,” Yan Hong finally managed to answer.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Born that way? It was all natural?! </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s jealousy towards Yan Hong suddenly rose to fever-pitch. </span><i><span style>Ning Yu didn’t eat badly at all, so why wasn’t </span></i><b><i>she </i></b><i><span style>born that way?! </span></i><span style>“That can’t be right,” Ning Xiaoyao suddenly came to a realization. “You must be fooling me. What kind of baby looks like that when they first come out of the womb? Wouldn’t that make them a freak?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, Yan Hong had grown used to Ning Xiaoyao’s hoodlum ways, so she quirked her lips into a charming smile. “Your Majesty, this young woman grew and grew until she turned into this. Wouldn’t that count as being born this way, too?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dangit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt that the world was completely unfair in that moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Shadowgale from the front, where he and the others had already drawn their swords. </span><i><span style>What time is it now for His Majesty to be fretting over Yan Hong’s chest size? Just what was the point of our trip this time?!</span></i></p>
