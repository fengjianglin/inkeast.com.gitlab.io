 <p>Chapter 226: I have you and you have me&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao walked forward and picked up the box before shaking it. There was obviously something inside and it smelled of blood as well as limestone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, be careful!” Yan Hong came back this time with Little White Fatty. When she saw Ning Xiaoyao about to open the box, she had to give her a reminder. “Just in case it has poison.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to fear,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she opened the box. The human head inside faced her head-on. Because it had been placed in limestone, much of the moisture had been sucked from the sky, distorting its facial features. But Ning Xiaoyao recognized it as Zhou </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>all the same---the woman who had served by the empress’s side. Last time, she’d seen her corpse by the edge of the city walls. Why was her head now in this box?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?” Ning Xiaoyao knelt down by the man as she held the box in one hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man lowered his head, refusing to look or speak to Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is Zhou </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>head in your hands?” Ning Xiaoyao lifted the man by his chin. “It’s fine if you don’t tell me. I’ll just send you to the Hall of Punishment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man opened his mouth a few times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know what they do at the Hall of Punishment?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, the man opened his mouth but didn’t make a sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’ll change you into a eunuch,” Ning Xiaoyao blathered on with her nonsense. “Come on. For the sake of keeping your manhood, you should tell me the truth. What’s going on here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the man spoke. “Aren’t eunuchs created in the silkworm room?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao slapped the man upside the head. “You knelt as soon as you saw me, so you know who I am. If I say the Hall of Punishment is where you’ll be a eunuch, then it’s where you’ll be a eunuch. Do you have any objections?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said the man. </span><i><span style>What kind of objections could I even have now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on here?” Ning Xiaoyao made the man stare at Zhou </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>head. The man knew he couldn’t afford to aggravate His Majesty, but what about aggravating the empress dowager? He was about to lose it. </span><i><span style>How did I get discovered by a cat of all things?! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao saw that the man still wouldn’t speak even after she’d made things very clear, so she took out the dagger hidden in her sleeve and waved it in front of the man’s eyes. “Won’t speak until you’re dead? Fine, I respect you as a real man. I’ll change you into a eunuch this instant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She moved the dagger towards the man’s little brother, her expression deathly serious. Seeing this, the man almost peed his pants from fear. He collapsed to the ground and rolled away just as Ning Xiaoyao’s dagger passed through the place where he’d been kneeling seconds before. Yan Hong approached him and half-knelt with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty is personally carrying out the sentence, yet you dare to run away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said the man. </span><i><span style>If I don’t run, am I supposed to turn into a eunuch for real?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yan Hong’s guileless smile remained on her face even as her fingers flashed. In an instant, a dagger had appeared in her hands. “Why would we need His Majesty to do these things? This young woman will break you from your root.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao walked toward and folded her arms, standing by Yan Hong’s side. She chuckled at the man and said, “This girl’s skills aren’t as fine as mine. Think it over carefully. If I did the deed, you might be able to live. But if Miss Yan Hong performed the cut, you could die, oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Yan Hong. </span><i><span style>Does castration actually require any special skills?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I, I’m only a messenger,” the man stammered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yan Hong’s dagger drew a line across the man’s chest. “A messenger who recognizes His Majesty on sight? Is his heavenly countenance something that everyone’s seen before?” Blood bled from her cut, soon staining the man’s entire chest area red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Castrate him,” Ning Xiaoyao ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yan Hong thought it over before lightly pressing against the man’s lips. Ning Xiaoyao’s sharp eyes picked up the black pill she stuffed into his mouth. Not more than a minute later, the man began to roll on the ground as he clutched his stomach. A strong and strapping man was soon reduced to sweat-soaked clothes as he cried out in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Do all members of the Poison Sect carry poisons on them at all times?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yan Hong looked at the man and said, “If you don’t want your intestines to rot away, you better answer everything His Majesty asks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man thrashed about on the ground, his fingernails digging into the dirt as he dug multiple holes. Ning Xiaoyao’s heart softened before she whispered, “Isn’t this too cruel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yan Hong smiled at her. “This young woman believes that Your Majesty isn’t the soft hearted type.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao fell silent. </span><i><span style>But I’m feeling soft hearted right now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yan Hong then continued, “What’s the loss if a man like this dies?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little White Fatty left Yan Hong’s feet to move towards Ning Xiaoyao instead. </span><i><span style>My master is still better.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sighed before walking up to pat the man. “Enough. If you don’t want to speak, then don’t say anything.” She could just &nbsp;ask Big Yellow from the city gates about the details since that area was his turf. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The man had been in excruciating pain before, but his stomach suddenly stopped hurting. He looked up in astonishment at Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>His Majesty used an antidote on me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Does it still hurt?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good, then,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “You can run along. If we meet again in the future, let’s just pretend we don’t know each other.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yan Hong’s face revealed nothing, but waves were crashing in her heart. </span><i><span style>How did His Majesty cure my poisons?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The man looked blankly at Ning Xiaoyao. “Your Majesty is letting me---letting this servant---go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you’re not leaving, are you expecting me to treat you to a meal as well?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man assumed he didn’t understand Ning Xiaoyao’s way of thinking because his life experiences were limited. </span><i><span style>He’s letting me go just like that? Without asking a single question?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of hoofbeats began ran out from the distant lane. Yan Hong grew alarmed again and asked, “Are those the Grand Preceptor’s men?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stood up and narrowed her eyes down the lane, before stating, “It’s Supreme Commander.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yan Hong could only hear the hoofbeats but didn’t see any people. </span><i><span style>Just what kind of eyes does His Majesty have?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You should really hurry up and leave,” Ning Xiaoyao told the man. “If you land in Supreme Commander’s hands, you’re done for. He’ll beat you to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man only looked at the wooden box in Ning Xiaoyao’s hands. </span><i><span style>How am I supposed to leave without this thing?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui soon reached Ning Xiaoyao on horseback and flipped onto the ground, where he quickly looked her over. “Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao raised an arm and flexed it. None of the others knew what she meant, but Lou Zigui did. He rested a hand against his forehead and said, “Yes, no one is a match for Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Anji?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captured,” Ning Xiaoyao said, before complaining, “That jerk even wanted to kill me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s face instantly fell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But he couldn’t beat me,” Ning Xiaoyao added smugly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked at the box in her hands and asked, “Whose is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhou </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>head,” Ning Xiaoyao said instead as she offered the box to him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui furrowed his brows before ordering his men, “All of you, withdraw.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The imperial guards all shifted back. Yan Hong also retreated to an ample distance so she couldn’t overheard what the two would talk about. Lou Zigui looked at the man still sprawled on the ground and asked, “You’re delivering this box to Iron Buddha Temple?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man only trembled in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whaa?” Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes widened. “This is for the empress?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Besides the empress, who else would care about this </span><i><span style>mama?” </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui patted Ning Xiaoyao on the head. “She’s one of the empress’s people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao lowered her head to look at the messenger. “Well dang, why didn’t I think of that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man was currently kneeling on the ground, too afraid to answer her question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does the empress dowager wish to tell the empress?” Lou Zigui asked the man coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Lou Zigui had already guessed what he was doing, the man had nothing more to hide. He quietly repeated the empress dowager’s words. Ning Xiaoyao dug her nails into her palms and whispered, “What a liar.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui squeezed her hand and replied in a low voice, “Don’t be sad. Since ancient times, the imperial clan has always been heartless. You have me.” His expression was exceptionally gentle as he spoke these words, his voice slightly husky and hoarse. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at Lou Zigui and wanted to say she wasn’t sad at all, but after second thought she simply nodded and said, “Mhm, I have you so I won’t be sad. You shouldn’t be sad if you run into anything, either, alright? You have me, too you know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moonlight shone upon them softly as Lou Zigui smiled and touched Ning Xiaoyao’s face with a nod. Ning Xiaoyao grinned back, showing all her teeth even as her eyes shrank into twin crescents. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” went the man on the ground. </span><i><span style>Why does something sound off about those words between those two?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do we do with him?” Ning Xiaoyao swung Lou Zigui’s hand as she asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui finally looked back at the man and said, “You should send him off to Iron Buddha Temple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” “Whaa?” Both the man and Ning Xiaoyao exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao to her side and said quietly, “I’ll explain things to you later.” Then he looked at the man and said, “Repeat the empress dowager’s words exactly as they are to the empress.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Then wouldn’t that make the empress hate me to death? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The man was looking at Lou Zigui blankly as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t want to work for the empress dowager all of a sudden now?” Lou Zigui asked. “Or do you want me to kill you right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man quickly muttered an assent to Lou Zigui’s previous orders and crawled to his feet. Lou Zigui took the wooden box from Ning Xiaoyao’s hands and placed it in the man’s arms. “You didn’t see His Majesty at all tonight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man looked at Ning Xiaoyao, who was still at a loss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man was still standing there spacing out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao began, “That’s not…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing her speak, the man seemed to suffer a jolt to his senses and bolted away. Ning Xiaoyao was confused and asked Lou Zigui, “Why is he running?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui waited until the fleeing figure was far away before replying. “He’s afraid that you’ll change your mind and take his life right here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want his life though,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Now it’s the empress dowager who wants mine. Supreme Commander, are you worried that the empress doesn’t hate me enough, either?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui brought Ning Xiaoyao to a more secluded spot before muttering back, “The empress dowager wants to use the empress to hurt you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao panicked. “Then we can’t let the empress dowager succeed. Supreme Commander, why did you let that man deliver Zhou </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>head to Iron Buddha Temple?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even without a head, the empress dowager can still find other ways to make the empress hate you,” Lou Zigui smoothed out the hair by Ning Xiaoyao’s temples as he spoke. “But if the empress hurts you now, it’ll be her man kneeling by your feet to beg mercy on her behalf in the future. He’ll even plea for the chance to serve you as compensation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought over Lou Zigui’s words for a long time before she said, “Leaving aside all the mistakes the empress has already made, I now have to wait for her to make a mortal error, then forgive her or punish her, so she’ll take the initiative to come to our side. Is that what you mean, Supreme Commander?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“....” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>No matter how much you look like a flower when smiling, I still think you’re wicked to the extreme, Supreme Commander!</span></i></p>
