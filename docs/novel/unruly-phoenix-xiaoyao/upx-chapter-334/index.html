 <p>Chapter 334: Fifth Young Miss took poison</p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, so it turns out that they’re Feng Muhai’s family.” Ning Xiaoyao had a ‘I understand’ expression. “Old Gramps, you don’t understand the matters of the army right? Come come, Windy,” Ning Xiaoyao yelled for Shadowgale, “Introduce this Feng Muhai to Old Gramps.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li commented, “Your Majesty, this subject knows who he is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao: … </span><i><span style>But I don’t know, ah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Feng Muhai’s maternal aunt is Xie Wenjing’s official wife,” Windy explained. </span><span style>Ning Xiaoyao knew about Xie Wenjing. He was Grand Preceptor Xie’s brother and he was killed by the Empress’ true love on a public road. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Out of the thirty-six barracks in the capital city and its environs, Feng Muhai is in charge of three barracks. He is regarded very highly by Xie Wenyuan,” Shadowgale added. Deep down, Head Commander Shadowgale was certain that His Majesty knew nothing of Feng Muhai aside from his name. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did Xie Wenyuan decide to rescue Feng Muhai?” Elder Li asked while looking at Ning Xiaoyao. Ning Xiaoyao suggested, “Perhaps General Feng still has usable troops in his hands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is impossible,” Elder Li shook his head firmly. </span><span style>“Oh, then I don’t know.” Ning Xiaoyao shrugged her shoulders. This made Elder Li choke. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really don’t know.” Ning Xiaoyao was also getting anxious. </span><i><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie is plotting to destroy the world right now and she has no way to stop him because she can’t find this fellow, ah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li didn’t speak to Ning Xiaoyao anymore. Old Gramps picked up the memorial from Yan City’s governor and looked at it again. He scrutinized each and every word, causing Ning Xiaoyao to wonder whether the memorial possessed some hidden profound meaning she was unaware of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One of Feng Muhai’s young grandsons is still alive,” Shadowgale informed Ning Xiaoyao. </span><span style>“Okay, so the young infant didn’t die.” Ning Xiaoyao wasn’t concerned about this. She just wanted to know where Grand Preceptor Xie was hiding now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Feng Muhai must be useful to Xie Wenyuan,” Elder Li reckoned. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao asked, “In what ways?” </span><span style>Elder Li replied, “This subject doesn’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The subject doesn’t know, the emperor also doesn’t know. We’re even finding ourselves at a loss because we were caught unprepared, ah.</span></i><span style> Ning Xiaoyao hugged her head. Suddenly, she felt like finding something to eat in the kitchen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li departed with the memorial from Yan City’s governor. There was nothing fruitful from discussing with Ning Xiaoyao so Old Gramps decided to return to his residence to have a discussion with his disciples instead. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stood up and told Shadowgale, “Let’s go have a meal in the kitchen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale: … </span><i><span style>How could he still be in the mood to eat?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“At any rate, regardless if we eat or not, we can’t come up with any ideas.” Ning Xiaoyao said like a hoodlum, “In that case, we might as well go and eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No one from the Xie Clan has looked for Fifth Young Miss,” On their way to the kitchen, Shadowgale suddenly mentioned to Ning Xiaoyao in a soft voice. </span><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stopped in her tracks and turned her head to look at Shadowgale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The elderly Buddhist nun at the nunnery said that she has no fate with Buddha and was unwilling to shave her head for her,” Shadowgale added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s going to be your wife. That means that she’s destined to have no fate with Buddha, ah.” Ning Xiaoyao knitted her eyebrows and stared at Shadowgale, “Windy, why do I feel that you want to use Fifth Young Miss to find Grand Preceptor? I don’t think you should do that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale didn’t reply. “Don’t worry about this anymore.” Ning Xiaoyao patted Shadowgale’s shoulder. “Grand Preceptor even abandoned his own wife. How could he possibly dispatch people to look for Fifth Young Miss? That’s impossible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m currently by Fifth Young Miss’ side,” Shadowgale lowered his voice, “Your Majesty, since I am one of your personal Dragon Guards, Xie Wenyuan will most likely use this as an opportunity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao lost all her appetite. </span><i><span style>There is no doubt about this. Putting feelings aside, Windy is staying beside Fifth Young Miss to use her.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Shadowgale continued, “If people from the Xie Clan come to look for Fifth Young Miss, I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Windy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Shadowgale justified, “I don’t want to do this either. But we want to see how Xie Wenyuan will deal with this matter, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao asked, “Then what do you want to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty can summon her once into the palace,” Shadowgale elaborated, “If Xie Wenyuan’s people are monitoring her, then Xie Wenyuan will definitely find out about this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if Fifth Young Miss wants to kill me?” After being silent for a long time, Ning Xiaoyao finally asked Shadowgale this one question. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll kill her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao: … </span><i><span style>This can’t turn out well anymore. How can they have a romantic relationship if he’s heartless enough to kill her? He might as well be a stranger, ah. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, I know exactly what I’m doing.” Shadowgale looked at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then just don’t give Fifth Young Miss the opportunity to kill me. Isn’t that the solution?” Ning Xiaoyao felt emotionally exhausted, “That way, Grand Preceptor can’t make use of her either, right? Windy, let us not torment ourselves like this, ok?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I must do this in order to test &nbsp;Xie Duoying’s character.” Shadowgale shook his head. “I have ruminated over this matter. May Your Majesty graciously grant me the permission to proceed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t we go find you another young lady?” Ning Xiaoyao proposed. Shadowgale looked at Ning Xiaoyao. He smiled for a moment but didn’t respond.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That means it’s out of the question.</span></i><span style> Ning Xiaoyao felt emotionally drained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I disappoint Your Majesty for the sake of a woman, then I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, don’t say anymore.” Ning Xiaoyao walked towards the kitchen with heavy footsteps. </span><i><span style>She can’t let him continue the conversation. If he keeps going, she may even conclude that Windy has fallen in love with her.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me think for a moment. You can’t be careless when it comes to feelings!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale asked, “What does this have to do with feelings?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I say it’s related, then it’s related.” Ning Xiaoyao fiercely stated, “I’m the emperor, you have to listen to me.” </span><i><span style>If two people like each other, then they should be together. If they don’t like each other, then they should say goodbye and part amicably from each other. Even if they can’t be friends when they meet again, they also shouldn’t become enemies. What is this all about, making use of each other? On one hand, they date and express their affection for each other. On the other hand, they wait for the other to expose their evil true colors? What is this! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sat down to eat two bowls of white rice. Her mood didn’t improve at all, it was still extremely terrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty.” Shadowgale accompanied Ning Xiaoyao to eat one bowl of rice. When he saw Ning Xiaoyao place the empty bowl down, he wanted to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t talk, let me think about it more.” Ning Xiaoyao stood up and left. </span><i><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie is really the bane of people!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao avoided Shadowgale for the entire day. When it reached nighttime, Ning Xiaoyao was sitting behind the desk and writing a letter to Lou Zigui. After writing about what had transpired in Yan City, Ning Xiaoyao also wanted to write about Shadowgale and Fifth Young Miss Xie. She had just written a ‘Xie’ character on the letter when Shadowrain’s voice could be heard from outside the door. “Your Majesty, something bad has happened!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s hand trembled, causing a few drops of ink to drip onto the letter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, there is an old nun outside the palace gate saying that something has happened to Fifth Young Miss Xie,” Shadowgale entered the palace chamber to report to Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The old nun said that Fifth Young Miss has taken poison.” The brush in Ning Xiaoyao’s hand fell onto the desk. </span><i><span style>Did Fifth Young Miss discover Shadowgale’s plans? So now she has given up all hope towards love, and decided to commit suicide?! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, what are your thoughts on this?” Shadowrain asked Ning Xiaoyao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You seem very composed.” Ning Xiaoyao looked at Shadowrain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s good about the Xie Clan’s daughters?” Shadowrain started grumbling to Ning Xiaoyao, “Any random woman on the streets would be a better catch than the Xie Clan’s daughters, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was stupefied by Shadowrain’s complaint. </span><i><span style>So it turns out the identity as Xie Clan’s daughter really annoys people, eh? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Not to mention, Windy is a Dragon Guard. How can he get together with a daughter of the Xie Clan?” Shadowrain continued to complain, “Right now, she is even causing more trouble by committing suicide. What exactly does she want?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go take a look at her.” Ning Xiaoyao stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!” Shadowrain exclaimed. </span><i><span style>They have been going back and forth. Is His Majesty even listening to what he’s saying? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“She was chased out by the Xie Clan,” Ning Xiaoyao scowled at Shadowrain, “Xie Wenyuan is my maternal grandfather so my biological mum is a Xie Clan daughter too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A terrified expression briefly appeared on Shadowrain’s face. He lowered his head and no longer spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You suggest finding a random woman on the streets,” Ning Xiaoyao jabbed Shadowrain’s head with her finger, “Are those young ladies as pretty as Fifth Young Miss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain couldn’t say anything. </span><i><span style>True, they weren’t as pretty.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s Windy?” Ning Xiaoyao asked as she stood by the palace chamber’s door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain replied, “He went to see Fifth Young Miss.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“We should go too.” Ning Xiaoyao walked outside the corridor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two hours later, Ning Xiaoyao stood outside the entrance of the Buddhist nunnery. Looking at the four-roomed nunnery before her eyes, Ning Xiaoyao told Shadowrain, “Isn’t this place a little too small compared to the Iron Buddha temple?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain didn’t reply. </span><i><span style>What is there to compare?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was about to walk towards the nunnery when a barking sound could be heard from behind. “</span><i><span style>Woof woof</span></i><span style>, Xiaoyao!” It was a mournful shrill that was harsh to the ear. </span><span style>Ning Xiaoyao hastily turned around to look. She realized Big Yellow was barking while shaking its head at her nearby. Big Yellow was a dog from the south side of the capital. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, I’ll go chase the stray dog away.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment.” Ning Xiaoyao held onto Shadowrain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are people in the woods,” Big Yellow shouted, “They want to burn you to death! There is also something on top of the walls. Xiaoyao, you should take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao hastily turned around to examine the courtyard walls of the nunnery. The courtyard walls were smeared with plaster. At first, Ning Xiaoyao couldn’t detect anything wrong with the wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain saw Ning Xiaoyao staring fixedly at the wall and hastily grabbed a torch from a Dragon Guard. However, despite carefully scanning the wall with the torch, Shadowrain didn’t find anything suspicious. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are people hidden in the woods across from us,” Ning Xiaoyao instructed Shadowrain softly, “Third Rain, bring people to outflank them from behind. Strive to capture them alive this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Shadowrain’s hand instinctively touched the sword at his waist. </span><span style>“Yes.” Ning Xiaoyao reached out to knock the wall with her hand. The layer of plaster fell off and revealed a black wall. It was even emitting a smell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oil?” Shadowrain’s face turned ghastly pale. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, they used oil to brush the walls. Damn it, they don’t lack money,” Ning Xiaoyao cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain rapidly turned around and stared at his surroundings. “If we approach them head on, wouldn’t these people just run?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep down, Ning Xiaoyao calculated the maximum shooting range of the bows and arrows from this world. She exercised her wrists a little and told Shadowrain, “Then don’t outflank anymore. Let’s cancel this battle tactic. Instead, I’ll hurl the wall over. Third Rain, when you see the wall fly, charge over there with the bros and kill them.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain: … </span><i><span style>Hurl the wall?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gripped the wall and hollered, “Big Yellow, run to me!” </span><span style>Big Yellow immediately dashed to where Ning Xiaoyao was standing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao exerted the strength in her hands and lifted half of the wall. She turned around and directly hurled it according to the distance she had calculated in her mind. </span><span style>The Dragon Guards were dumbstruck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Shadowrain had no time to be dumbstruck. He pulled out the sword from the sheath and commanded his brothers, “Seize the assassins!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half of the wall landed squarely in the middle of a tree and snapped it in half. Those hiding at the top of the trees fell to the ground, while those hiding underneath the tree failed to flee in time and were crushed head-on by the broken tree and brick rubble. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao!” Big Yellow hadn’t reached Ning Xiaoyao yet when he barked, “The leader is still by the pool in the woods.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.” Ning Xiaoyao resolutely made a prompt decision. “Big Yellow, lead the way. Later, I’ll feed you meat and bones until you’re full.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Yellow turned to dash into the woods again. That leader appeared very fierce and looked like he had killed many dogs. However, for the sake of the meat and bones, Big Yellow decided to go all out!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao ran faster than Big Yellow. It only took her two steps to catch up to him. So, she simply carried the dog and ran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain saw Ning Xiaoyao running past himself. By the time he was able to react and wanted to give chase, there was already no sign of His Majesty.</span></p>
