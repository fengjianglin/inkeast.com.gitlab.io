 <p>Chapter 267: For the sake of world peace&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on here?” Grand Preceptor Xie asked the doctors. None of them could offer an explanation, because all of them still felt like they were dreaming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak!” Grand Preceptor Xie’s tone grew severe then. The terrified doctors all backed away to opposite sides of the bed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the older ones finally piped up, “The Great General’s wounds, Grand Preceptor, you---you’ve seen them with your own eyes a-as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Many others have, too,” another doctor spoke up. “None of us would have dared to hide this from you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie walked to Chen Lu’s bedside. He had indeed witnessed the man’s injuries, but now he was completely healed just like that? How could that happen? While he was puzzling over the impossibilities and shaking his head, the image of Ning Xiaoyao suddenly appeared in his head. </span><i><span style>It’s not like this hasn’t happened before…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Aside from you, who else has the abilities to bring someone back from near death?” Lou Zigui asked. “Xiaoyao, Xie Wenyuan can figure out that you were the one who saved Chen Lu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shrugged her shoulders carelessly. “The Grand Preceptor’s always wanted to bite me to death. If he finds out, he’ll just want to bite me even more. What’s so scary about that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui raised a hand to rub her head. </span><i><span style>What she says makes sense for once.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Née Xu,” Grand Preceptor Xie attempted to explain himself, but Lady Xu never gave him the chance to finish.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked at Chen Lu and said, “Weren’t you on death’s door?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I,” Chen Lu began, “I ran into the Lord Protector Pei Yi during the day. He--he wanted to kill---no, his men shot me with arrows, then he hacked me with his shoulder on my shoulder. I remember I was…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard your injuries were severe,” Lady Xu continued. “Tell me, where are your arrow wound and sword injury? If the Lord Protector dared to kill you, I’ll kill him in turn!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Lu looked down at his body again before sending a pleading glance towards the Grand Preceptor. This was all too incredible for him to take in. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie said, “His Majesty has a miracle doctor at his side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neither the doctors nor Lady Xu took kindly to his words. </span><i><span style>Could any doctor heal an almost dead man in the blink of an eye?</span></i><span style> That wasn’t a miracle doctor, but an outright immortal! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Lady Xu said simply. She didn’t look at Grand Preceptor Xie, but stared at Chen Lu instead. “So there was a miracle doctor. His Majesty tried to kill you, then sent his doctor to save you. Just what is His Majesty doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Lu was still looking towards Grand Preceptor Xie. </span><i><span style>Just what is His Majesty doing?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally, to win his goodwill,” Grand Preceptor Xie replied easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goodwill,” Lady Xu echoed. “Why would His Majesty want a man who couldn’t even defeat the Lord Protector in combat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said everyone else. </span><i><span style>You might as well call Great General Chen a useless good-for-nothing directly instead. Going around in circles like this is tiring to hear.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Young lady, ah,” Grand Preceptor Xie sighed, “You’re Xu Jing’s daughter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Xu finally looked at Grand Preceptor Xi. “So it’s this consort who hurt Great General Chen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, that’s not what the Grand Preceptor meant,” Chen Lu waved his hands at née Xu so she could stop talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s the copper fish?” Lady Xu asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Lu looked around the bed, then at Grand Preceptor Xie. </span><i><span style>Where’s the Chen Clan copper fish I keep hidden on my person?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who was in charge of changing clothes for Great General Chen?” Grand Preceptor Xie asked the servants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The servants exchanged glances before discovering that the two pageboys in charge of waiting on Great General Chen had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It must have been His Majesty,” Grand Preceptor Xie muttered. There was no question. Ning Yu must have sent someone to kidnap the pageboys. </span><i><span style>But what does she need them for?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s gone, ah,” Lady Xu said while looking at Chen Lu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Lu only felt jumpy as he faced his wife with a sheepish smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Xu said, “This consort has to congratulate the general for having both a son and daughter now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Chen Lu was flabbergasted. </span><i><span style>Where did this come from? </span></i><span style>If they had a son and daughter, would they have spent the last few years asking doctors for medicine to treat her body?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The née Xiang sisters, ah,” Lady Xu said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W, what née Xiang sisters?” Chen Lu asked Grand Preceptor Xie again. </span><i><span style>Did something happen while I was unconscious?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did these née Xiang sisters come from?” Grand Preceptor Xie asked Lady Xu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor was their matchmaker and even has the marriage certificate in your estate,” Lady Xu said as she smiled at him. “You can’t forget a pair of flowers like them so easily, Grand Preceptor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie’s mind spun fast before he finally realized what was going on. “Lass, don’t fall for others’ attempt to sow discord. Think about it yourself, His Majesty---the rest of you, withdraw,” He stopped halfway to address the crowd in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The doctors and all of the Grand Preceptor’s servants immediately left the bedroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no née Xiang,” Chen Lu flared up. “I don’t know any woman surnamed Xiang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Xu only smiled coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie said, “Lass, think it over carefully. His Majesty ordered men to kill the pageboys, then stole Chen Lu’s copper fish. What use does this fish have for him? You and Chen Lu are both here, so he can use it to support another member of the Chen Clan with the authentication token. Anyone with the fish will be recognized as the head of the Jiangyin Chen Clan members, yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Lu suddenly said, “Didn’t something happen to His Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie only lowered his voice. “Nobody saw what happened. It’s hard to verify whether anything really did.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Chen Lu. </span><i><span style>Could there be anything fake about the death of an emperor?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Xu didn’t reveal her thoughts beyond staring at Grand Preceptor Xie. “Then it’s still His Majesty who wants to break apart the relations between me and the general?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As long as you understand, that’s good,” Grand Preceptor Xie said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, Ning Xiaoyao whispered a few words in Lou Zigui’s ear. Then the two of them flew off the roof to land in the flower gardnes, where they untied the pageboys and undid their gags. Ning Xiaoyao patted them both once to wake them up. At the sight of Lou Zigui, both boys prepared to scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re actually slacking off by napping here?!” Lou Zigui beat them to it. “Damned things, you deserve to die. Aren’t you afraid of the Grand Preceptor beating you to death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two pageboys were stunned into silence. They exchanged glances, neither of them clear on how they’d ended up in the flower gardens in the first place. Before this, they were clearly waiting in front of the general’s bed. Seeing their silence, Lou Zigui was certain the two didn’t recognize him by appearances alone and added, “If you want to live, then come with me and don’t say a word.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, Lou Zigui was dressed in the guard costume of the Grand Preceptor’s men, so the two pageboys only stared at him before one asked, “Why do you want to help us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Five taels of silver,” Lou Zigui replied. “Give me the money and I’ll tell the Grand Preceptor that you went to the kitchens to help Great General Chen boil some hot water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“B-but nobody ordered us to do that,” the pageboy stammered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then add in 15 more taels,” Lou Zigui said, “And I’ll help you two bribe a doctor.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>20 taels of silver. </span></i><span style>For a servant, these were monumental sums. The two pageboys looked at Lou Zigui with expressions of despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to keep the money or your lives?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course their lives were more important. The pageboys felt their hearts dripping blood with pain as they nodded in agreement. Ning Xiaoyao only watched Lou Zigui cheat the pair out of 20 taels of silver with her eyes nearly popping out of her sockets. </span><i><span style>That works too?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui began to bring the two to the door of the courtyard. The two pageboys inspected themselves and found no injuries, just a few splotches of mud on their clothes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y-you’re the one who tricked us?” one of the them asked Lou Zigui. There was no way they’d run to the flowerbeds for no reason. </span><i><span style>This man must want our silver, so he knocked us out and brought us there! </span></i><span style>At this, the pageboy suddenly wished that Lou Zigui could die right that instant!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui only kept walking without looking back. “Do you want to keep the money, or your lives?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re only servants and don’t have much money, ah,” the more docile-looking of the pair spoke up pitifully. “We really don’t have any at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you want to keep the money,” Lou Zigui said simply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said the two pageboys.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui brought the two pageboys to the exit before suddenly adding in a small voice, “If anyone asks you in the future, just say the people sent to wait on Great General Chen already died. Got it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two pageboys felt lightheaded at his words. </span><i><span style>What’s this all about? Why haven’t we made heads or tails of it from the beginning to the end? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui brought the pair far away before a few of the Chen Estate servant girls and nannies rounded the corner from a different direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did that guard mean?” one of the nannies murmured. “Nobody died, but they have to insist that someone did?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We should tell her ladyship about this, right?” a servant girl piped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few of the nannies exchanged glances. Yes, they’d have to do that. Something about it didn’t feel right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the bedroom, Grand Preceptor Xie was doing his best to coax Lady Xu while Ning Xiaoyoa eavesdropped from the window. The more she listened, the more sick at heart she felt. </span><i><span style>This old man’s too gifted with his gab! It feels like Lady Xu’s going to revolt and find me for revenge at any second!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, one of the Chen Estate nannies approached the entrance to the room and silently called for Lady Xu. She walked out and mistress and servant began to talk in the covered walkway outdoors. The nanny repeated Lou Zigui’s words to Lady Xu, then added, “Mistress, this is more complicated than it appears.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two little pageboys?” Lady Xu asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nanny nodded. “And a guard was leading them in the front. It looks like he holds some status in the household, probably as one of the Grand Preceptor’s personal men. The two little ones were nothing buy pageboys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This nanny had followed Lady Xu from her clan to the Chen household, so she was extremely loyal to her mistress. The reality of the situation was that no matter how well your birthright might be, or what position you held in the Chen Clan, even as head mistress, that née Xiang had already birthed a son and daughter to the general. Behind her was even the support of the almighty Grand Preceptor. How was her mistress supposed to face off against such a woman? Leaving aside the possiblity of a concubine, those two children were definitely of the Xiang Clan. Once the general grew old, wouldn’t they end up as the new masters of the household? Who would they favor then? A dead husband passed on his holdings to his son. Her mistress would only suffer in the days to come, ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Xu’s voice was cold. “Call everyone inside. If Chen Lu doesn’t give me a proper explanation by today, this isn’t over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mistress, what are you planning to do?” the nanny asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since it’s Chen Lu’s offpsring,” Lady Xu said, “It naturally falls to me to raise them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nanny exhaled. </span><i><span style>Looks like my mistress hasn’t lost her wits despite her anger. She knows what she has to do first. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stuck her hand inside her mouth. </span><i><span style>God, she’s even planning to steal the children away! That’s brutal!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The nanny obeyed Lady Xu’s orders before going to call for the other servants. Once they were all assembled, Lady Xu looked at them with a disdainful eye. </span><i><span style>Worthless things. </span></i><span style>Both the doctors and the Grand Preceptor’s servants were only bewildered by her flare. </span><i><span style>Did we offend her ladyship somehow?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao brought Oil Jar back to the rooftop, where she pushed aside another tile to peek into the hall. Finally, the battle was about to begin. She mentally lit a candle in memory of Chen Lu. As for Grand Preceptor Xie---she was only anticipating how that Lady Xu could beat him to death instead!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>For the sake of world peace, do your best, heroine!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao saw Lady Xu walk into the room before clenching her hands into a fist pump.</span></p>
