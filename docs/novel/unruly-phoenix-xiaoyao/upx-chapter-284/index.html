 <p>Chapter 284: Extra 30,000 troops</p>
 <p><span style>After the storm, it took half a day for the sky to go back to normal. But by the afternoon, the sky was dark again and the burning sun was blocked by thunderous clouds. Although the sun was blocked, the air was incredibly still. The decreasing air pressure made it difficult for people to breathe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The escaping elderly stood by the city gates, looking back on the city sighing, “There’s going to be another storm ah.” At the same moment, Ning Xiaoyao sat on the roof of the Supreme Splendor Hall and muttered, “The silence before the storm.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Still hugging a bag of sugar beans, Ning Xiaoyao sat on the roof with Big Boss Black lying on his left and Little White Fatty crouching on his right. Oil Jar was on her shoulder. Just like that, Ning Xiaoyao remained on the rooftop for a day, two days, then three days. It wasn’t until the morning of the fourth day that she received news of Grand Preceptor Xie’s army reaching the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are close to 70,000 troops and horses,” reported Shadowrain. &nbsp;He had gone out of the city to seek information. Third Commander’s face was pale. Nearly 70,000 troops were on the way. This number far exceeded Lou Zigui’s predictions. It was also beyond the comfort zone of Shadowrain and the others. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander didn’t say there would be so many troops ah!” Shadowrain complained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at those standing before her. “I've said this before, Grand Preceptor Xie is Supreme Commander’s unlucky star. This is fate. With matters pertaining to Grand Preceptor Xie, Supreme Commander can’t win.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what did Supreme Commander say?” Shadowthunder urgently asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain looked at Ning Xiaoyao and revealed, “Supreme Commander said with him around, there’s no need for His Majesty to worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are almost 70,000 troops here and he’s telling His Majesty not to worry?!” Shadowbolt shouted. Deep down, he seriously wondered if Supreme Commander wanted to ruin His Majesty ah?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Calm down. Fourth Lightning, we have to calm down,” Ning Xiaoyao pushed him down to sit. “When it comes to war affairs, Supreme Commander is more knowledgeable than us”. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!!!” The three commanders Shadowthunder, Shadowrain and Shadowbolt exclaimed at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, it doesn’t matter how many people they have. If I want to run, I still can,” she coaxed the three, “Don’t worry! We can’t panic before the battle. Come come, take deep breaths.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three commanders were in no mood for deep breathing exercises. They were almost worried to death!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Wenyuan hasn’t left the city,” said Shadowrain, “Your Majesty, the old traitor is so certain you won’t kill him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I’m still here too.” Ning Xiaoyao sat down and popped a sugar bean in her mouth. “I can’t help but feel that Grand Preceptor Xie is up to no good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He has rebelled ah!!” Shadowbolt shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, are you going to leave the capital to meet Supreme Commander?” asked Shadowrain, “This matter can’t simply be resolved with a simple ‘</span><i><span style>He’s here and all will work out</span></i><span style>’ right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt added, “Yeah! There are still so many people in the city that have no places to go. Once the battle starts, we can run, but what will happen to the common people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowthunder and Shadowrain glared at Shadowbolt. </span><i><span style>It’s already difficult enough for us to escape in this situation and you still want His Majesty to save all the common people in the city?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt blinked quickly at his two brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain immediately realised that His Majesty did not care about other things and would only feel anxious when it concerned the common people. He then stopped Shadowthunder from saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, Ning Xiaoyao couldn’t sit still and thought to herself, </span><i><span style>with so many enemies, I’ll be fine but what about the common people in the city?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’d better go look for Supreme Commander,” she stood up preparing to run off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain quickly blocked her path with his hand. “You’re just going like that? Elder Li and his men have closed all the doors in the palace ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao spun on her heels thinking, </span><i><span style>oh yeah! Elder Li and the rest also have yet to be sent out of the city.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Should we tell Elder Li and his men the truth?” asked Shadowthunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sighed. </span><i><span style>If she could, she would already have</span></i><span style>. “I’m going to hide my face. I will discuss these matters with Supreme Commander. You all can wait for me in the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she turned and ran while Shadowrain and the others frowned unhappily. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to follow her, but with His Majesty’s speed, the wouldn’t be able to catch up even if they ran with their lives!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao ran back to her new bedroom and took a veil to cover her face. But after looking out of the window, she thought, </span><i><span style>wouldn’t covering her face on a normal day bring about more attention? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After thinking carefully, she took out the flowery skirt and dressed as a lady with a veil. </span><i><span style>In this day and age, this is more acceptable ah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Giving herself a ‘</span><i><span style>like</span></i><span style>’, Ning Xiaoyao changed into the dress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a military tent outside the South Wall, Lou Zigui finished his breakfast and placed down the empty bowl before speaking to the generals before him. “What is 30,000 extra men? The greater the number, the bigger mix of good and bad soldiers. Wouldn’t that make this battle much easier?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The generals of the Black Frost Calvary were not worried about rushing into battle. “We are just worried after they have attacked our capital, our horses and men wouldn’t be able to enter the city,” Deng Rong said, “Supreme Commander, that extra thirty thousand troops will deter thirty thousand of our own troops ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is why I have decided to station a troop in the city,” Lou Zigui replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The generals looked at each other thinking, </span><i><span style>did they still have anyone available to go in and out of the city freely?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xu Feiyu will arrive today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s bringing the troops personally?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He still has the audacity to come?!” Deng Rong and Shen Mu replied simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked at the two of them. “At this juncture, there are some matters that we should not mention anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s finish this battle first,” another general said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In Xu Feiyu’s message, he said he’s bringing all of the Zhou Family’s troops,” Lou Zigui said quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s not afraid of Xie Wenyuan knowing?” a general asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Things have already reached this point, so what if Xie Wenyuan knows?” Lou Zigui pushed the empty bowl aside. “It’s not like we’ve never gone to war. Has gathering here caused all of you to panic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The generals would never admit that they were panicking. They’ve already fought many wars with the Northern Hu people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the land of the Emperor,” Deng Rong reminded Lou Zigui, “Not the lands outside Wushuang City ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“War is war no matter where it’s fought, you guys...” Lou Zigui was cut off when he heard a very familiar voice outside the door shouting, “Supreme Commander?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a second, there was silence in the military tent. A few generals then shouted loudly, “Who?!” </span></p>
 <p><em><span style>They have heard the voice of the door guard and this voice did not belong to him!</span></em></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough, stop yelling,” Lou Zigui quickly walked out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Has Xue Feiyu arrived?” a general asked, stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xue Feiyu’s voice sounds like that? You can’t tell if it’s a woman or a man?” Deng Rong was unconvinced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Based on Supreme Commander’s expression, it’s obviously not Xu Feiyu,” another general said, chasing after him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other generals agreed. </span><i><span style>Their Supreme Commander would never run to receive Xu Feiyu</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!” Lou Zigui walked out of the tent and was shocked when he saw Ning Xiaoyao in the flowery dress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander,” the door guard stammered, “She… she suddenly appeared. This inferior one didn’t have the time to announce.” </span><i><span style>He didn’t watch the tent properly. Would Supreme Commander punish him according to the military punishments ah?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui waved his hand to the guard and looked at Ning Xiaoyao. “Why did you come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She tugged on her collar. “I’ve come to find you for some matters ah. Ai, this hot weather is killing me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!” Lou Zigui could hear the generals rushing out from inside the tent. He looked at Ning Xiaoyao’s exposed collar showing her slim neck and clavicle. Lou Zigui immediately took off his outer robe and wrapped her up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m warm…” Ning Xiaoyao wanted to shout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop yelling,” Lou Zigui covered her mouth with his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the generals who exited the tent were stunned. </span><i><span style>Their Supreme Commander was actually hugging a lady! And his outer robe was actually on this lady! Not only that, his hand was covering her mouth! Did their Supreme Commander finally find a girl while they weren’t paying attention?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you, leave to do your own thing,” Lou Zigui ordered while pulling Ning Xiaoyao back towards the tent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander,” Deng Rong stood in front of him and stared at Ning Xiaoyao saying, “Who is this lady ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wasn’t afraid of being seen by Deng Rong and the rest. After all, this wasn’t her first time wearing a dress. But Lou Zigui did not let go of her mouth. Since he wouldn’t allow her to speak, she could only play dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui frowned and icily glared at the curious men before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Rong and the others retreated. Lou Zigui was displaying his icy face. This meant that Supreme Commander was giving them a warning. </span><i><span style>It’s best not to provoke him, or who knows what he would do to you.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After the generals left, Lou Zigui glanced at the door guard and soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers lowered their heads and wished that they could bury themselves underground. Supreme Commander was actually not fierce and quite polite to them. However, for reasons unknown to them, they were very afraid of him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers have privately discussed this amongst themselves and concluded that Supreme Commander Lou probably killed too many people. In addition, he was also the star of misfortune. Hence, his killing intent was too strong. (</span><i><span style>Author: Hey! Don’t be like that ah!</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao into the tent.&nbsp;</span><span style>She looked at all the empty porridge bowls. “You’ve eaten la.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s still one mantou, do you want it?” Lou Zigui pointed to the plate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gulped down her saliva. “No, I'm not going to eat. Supreme Commander you’re about to fight a war, you eat it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui smiled, pulling Ning Xiaoyao to sit. “What brings you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taking off the outer robe, she replied, “There are 70,000 of Grand Preceptor’s troops on their way here. I’ve come to ask about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui reached out and buttoned up Ning Xiaoyao’s collar. He murmured, “Since you’re already here, just stay outside the capital then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re talking about the 70,000 troops,” Ning Xiaoyao said seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Almost 70,000.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, almost 70,000. Supreme Commander, can we really win this war?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Wenyuan is only a scholar,” Lou Zigui took the mantou from the plate and placed it in Ning Xiaoyao’s hands. He lightly explained, “There are only less than 30,000 elite soldiers. With nearly 70,000 horses and men, I only need to ambush one of his battalions and his army would be defeated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really???” Ning Xiaoyao was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In a battlefield, the biggest concern is to have deserters,” Lou Zigui said while pouring her a cup of water, “That is because deserters will cause chaos within the army. This time, Xie Wenyuan’s soldiers are invading the city. They are rebelling. The soldiers would definitely feel uneasy to begin with. If a military ambush occurs, his troops would be finished.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought Supreme Commander Lou’s words made sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“War is not only about competing in numbers,” Lou Zigui smiled briefly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao bit into the mantou, </span><i><span style>This isn’t as good as the one made by Chef Huang</span></i><span style>. Deep down, she still felt uneasy. For some reason, she felt like something bad was about to happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao,” Lou Zigui walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going back, your beauty trap is useless against me,” Ning Xiaoyao pushed the beautiful face that was in front of her. Ning Xiaoyao was suddenly feeling very restless. </span><i><span style>It looks like I’ll have to make a trip to the Grand Preceptor’s estate to investigate my enemy’s plans.</span></i></p>
