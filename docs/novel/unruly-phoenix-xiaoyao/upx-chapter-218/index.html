 <p>Chapter 218: Prince Fu wants to die together&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“General Tao, prepare to depart with my uncle. Supreme Commander, take care of transferring the troops,” Ning Xiaoyao said before spreading her hands at Elder Li. “Old gramps, look at this. We didn’t need the Grand Preceptor after all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li asked, “Before moving the troops and horses, we’ll need grain and grass for them first. This subject respectfully asks Your Majesty how that is to be arranged?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at Prince Fu, who had thoroughly lost his temper. “This prince is already dividing up my family property. What else does Your Majesty want this prince to do?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Prince Fu’s eyes, he’d already given up so much. Anyone who had a sense of tact would know to stop demanding more things. But much to his disappointment, Ning Xiaoyao was completely tactless. She shrugged and said, “But I don’t have any money, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Prince Fu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your wife and children are both at Fenglin City, oh,” Ning Xiaoyao shrugged again with a sigh. “What to do? The Grand Preceptor has money, so maybe you could talk with him, uncle?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu wanted to kill Ning Xiaoyao more than anyone else, but now Grand Preceptor Xie was the second. “This. Prince. Has. No. Money!” he emphasized word by word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s decided,” Ning Xiaoyao told Lou Zigui and Tao Yu instead. “General Tao will set out tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tao Yu went on his knees without waiting for Prince Fu to protest. “This subject accepts the decree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rise,” Ning Xiaoyao said. She couldn’t help him up personally because Lou Zigui was holding her back, so she only made a lifting motion with her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go back to the military barracks,” Lou Zigui told Tao Yu after he stood up. “And assemble your subordinates there. Have them accompany you to East Ji.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Tao Yu hastily looked towards Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>I can even take my subordinates with me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought it over before nodding. “Mm, take them. I’ll worry less if you’re fighting with your brothers by your side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tao Yu’s eyes grew red with tears as his voice rose into a trill. </span><i><span style>“Your Majesty.”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I have experience with this,” Ning Xiaoyao said seriously. “I fight people a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui wanted to tell her that fighting wasn’t the same as war, but ultimately decided to keep quiet. </span><i><span style>Whatever makes her happy. </span></i><span style>Moreover, he could tell by Tao Yu’s state that he’d swallowed up all of Ning Xiaoyao’s words despite being the standoffish type of man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on,” Ning Xiaoyao wanted to pat Tao Yu on the shoulder, but Supreme Commander Lou pulled her back before she could reach him. She could only encourage the man with a wide grin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty will prepare the decree to transfer the troops and give you the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu_(tally)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>tiger tally</span></a><span style> by tonight,” Lou Zigui told Tao Yu. “You should make preparations first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tao Yu nodded, but suddenly fell on his knees again to reverently kowtow three times to Ning Xiaoyao. Then he rose and strode out of the audience hall with large strides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A real man,” Ning Xiaoyao told Lou Zigui as she pointed at Tao Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui just smiled. “Your Majesty has done very well in trusting your men and using them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu said, “Your Majesty, this prince hasn’t agreed to anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao simply looked at him until his face started turning shades of green. She sniffed, then said, “You have to do it even if you don’t want to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu took a large step back and raged, “Are you planning to be completely unreasonable?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh,” Ning Xiaoyao chuckled. “Were you being any more reasonable when you claimed all of East Ji’s grain for yourself?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That was because, that--” Prince Fu stuttered, before finding an excuse and spitting it out. “The late emperor always knew, but he never said this prince couldn’t do so!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You call him the late emperor too,” Ning Xiaoyao glanced at him. “Who’s the emperor now? It’s me, alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“....” said Prince Fu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have to have money,” Ning Xiaoyao folded her hands behind her back as she circled around Prince Fu. “When my father’s father was emperor, you were already Prince Fu. Now my father’s already been buried, but you’re still Prince Fu. How much money did you make just from selling grain all these years?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean, ‘my father’s father?’” Prince Fu wanted to change the subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not the point,” Ning Xiaoyao wasn’t fooled. Money and grain were the main points now, while everything else was irrelevant! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu fell silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Huh, you wanna fight me by keeping silent? You heartless, faithless bastard! Your big and little wives and your sons and daughters are all waiting for you to save them, but you’re not willing to part with your embezzled funds?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Th, those aren’t embezzled funds…” Prince Fu sounded very unconfident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh,” Ning Xiaoyao chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, that’s not it. This prince isn’t heartless or faithless…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh,” Ning Xiaoyao said again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You,” </span></i><span style>Prince Fu sputtered. “Can’t you spare a single coin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh,” Ning Xiaoyao looked towards Prince Fu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu grit his teeth. “Will you stop </span><i><span style>‘heheh’</span></i><span style>-ing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh,” said Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn your ancestors!” Prince Fu finally snapped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li and Lou Zigui didn’t even have time to rebuke him before Ning Xiaoyao’s mouth smirked. “Hey hey, we’re part of the same clan. Uncle, just what are you doing? Can you keep up like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I---this prince---ahhHHHHHHhhhh----” Prince Fu clawed at his head as he fell apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop making a row,” the Lord Protector looked at Prince Fu with a heavy heart. “If you keep scratching yourself like that, you’ll draw blood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu stopped, feeling as if his head was really bleeding. He looked at Ning Xiaoyao and debated whether he should die together with the wretch. Ning Xiaoyao formed a fist and said, “Uncle, ah, let me remind you: you can’t beat me in a fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector suddenly felt sorry for Prince Fu. </span><i><span style>His Majesty’s utterly ruthless when it comes to stepping on others.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Besides, what do you mean by can’t I spare a single coin?” Ning Xiaoyao added. “Who do the soldiers belong to? Who’s sending out the troops? Won’t a battle take lives or cause injuries? I’m sending out all those good men. Uncle, you should calculate the costs yourself. How much is the worth of a single human life?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu wanted to say that the lives of soldiers were worth utter crap, but he didn’t dare in the face of Ning Xiaoyao’s fist. That brazen bastard was fully capable of beating him up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have some shame,” Ning Xiaoyao sighed. “It’s already bad enough that our country has that unrepentant Grand Preceptor. Uncle, can’t you show some humility? Tell me, would the rebel bands have beaten East Ji so thoroughly if it wasn’t for your actions? The hearts of the people can,” Ning Xiaoyao paused to think, then looked towards Lou Zigui. “Can what again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The hearts of the people can support and oppose,” Lou Zigui finished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want me to talk more about life with you?” Ning Xiaoyao asked Prince Fu next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu’s face was burning. But if he gave away everything this time, how would he live his days once the rebel bands were gone? Now this bastard Ning Yu was telling him to do as he liked and blackmail him. If he ended up as a poor, powerless prince, wouldn’t Ning Yu be free to kill him whenever he wanted? (</span><i><span style>Author: Actually, prince, His Majesty has the guts to kill you even now, if she wanted to. </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o )</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of this prince’s money is at Fenglin City,” Prince Fu put up his final protest. “I have no way to bring out the cash or grain right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even rabbits have three dens. Would you really put all your money at Fenglin City?” Ning Xiaoyao looked at him with a </span><i><span style>do you take me for an idiot </span></i><span style>expression. “Uncle, if you keep acting like this, we might as well stop fighting for Fenglin. Whoever wants it can take it.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You,” </span></i><span style>Prince Fu pointed a finger a Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miaow!” Big Boss Black meowed loudly. Prince Fu saw the fat black cat by Lou Zigui’s feet and quietly withdrew his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That there, Your Excellency Pei, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao found Pei Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He bowed in response. “This subject is here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’d like to trouble you to take a walk with my uncle and withdraw all the money he has in the capital’s private banks,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Then move away all the grain from the shops of he and his relatives here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This prince has no grain shops in the capital!” Prince Fu yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you just have money stored here, then?” Ning Xiaoyao glanced at him. “You have both. Don’t think I can’t see through your greedy ways. You think about money birthing money even in your dreams.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A droplet of sweat rolled down Prince Fu’s forehead. </span><i><span style>When did this shameless wretch get so astute?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao silently gave Big Boss Black a thumbs up. She had pals that flew in the air, swam in the water, ran on the ground and dug in the earth. As long as she had questions, she would get answers. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on,” Ning Xiaoyao pointed at the doors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan took this chance to ask, “Your Majesty, are we taking grain from the other imperial clansmen’s shops as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Just say that my uncle’s borrowing it from them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu’s legs grew weak as he collapsed onto the ground. </span><i><span style>How am I supposed to live amongst the clansmen now? If we take all the grain from their stores, won’t they eat me alive?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Not just grain,” Ning Xiaoyao added after some thought. “Take away anything you can find. None of them are as poor as me, anyways. That’s what we’ll do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan glanced at Prince Fu, who was sitting on the ground, before falling to his knees before Ning Xiaoyao. “This subject accepts the decree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector felt like he was in a dream. </span><i><span style>When did our family’s second eldest start treating His Majesty with such respect? Isn’t this all too sudden?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Should I ask a few of the Dragon Guard big bros to come with you?” Ning Xiaoyao asked Prince Fu as she bid Pei Yan rise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu had to crawl multiple times before he staggered to his feet. “Isn’t Your Majesty afraid of the clansmen kneeling outside the palace and shouting at you to take back your decree?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Ning Xiaoyao was even too lazy to chuckle back. She simply rolled her eyes at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Prince Fu. </span><i><span style>I suffered that eyeroll for nothing. Of course, why would this wretch care about things like that at all?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Prince, if you please.” Pei Yan approached Prince Fu and gestured to him to go ahead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the Nine Gates Infantry Commander,” Ning Xiaoyao introduced Pei Yan. “He’s an important official of the court, so you have to respect him, uncle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu simply turned on his heel and stalked outside. </span><i><span style>Me, a prince, respecting a Nine Gates Infantry Commander? </span></i><span style>He felt like he never wanted to see Ning Xiaoyao again in this lifetime. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring along Windy and the rest,” Ning Xiaoyao whispered to Pei Yan. “They have experience moving things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Second Young Master Pei’s mouth twitched at that. </span><i><span style>Did they get that experience from moving away Xie Wenyuan’s things?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao exhaled in relief once Pei Yan and Prince Fu were gone. “Ah geez, it’s finally over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Over?” the Lord Protector gave a start.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “We’ve got soldiers, a general, the general’s pals, money, and grain. Lord Protector, is there anything else we need to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector shook his head. </span><i><span style>There really isn’t anything left.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked towards Elder Li and said, very respectfully, “Old gramps, you can go home and eat now, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li stared at Ning Xiaoyao with a complicated gaze, causing her body to stiffen. </span><i><span style>Does he still want to find me for something else?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li couldn’t help but think to himself how everything had been resolved. </span><i><span style>His Majesty actually pushed out Prince Fu to get rid of the problem before us?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao scooted behind Lou Zigui and whispered, “Why is old gramps looking at me like that? Does he want to bite me to death? What’s going on?” </span><i><span style>(Author: Just how much do you fear that old gramps, ah? What has he ever done to you?</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
