 <p><span style>“What do we do?” Imperial Physician Gao asked Ning Xiaoyao. Shadowrain was looking at her blankly, too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Third Rain, Supreme Commander didn’t tell you what to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain shook his head. Big Boss Black took this chance to scurry out from under the bed while holding something in his mouth. He meowed at Ning Xiaoyao, who looked down and saw the blood bag she’d taken from her robes between his jaws.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry, meow!” Big Boss Black urged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glared at Imperial Physician Gao before she declared, “Little Gao, you’re not even as smart as my Black Tubby!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Imperial Physician Gao. </span><i><span style>You make it sound like you had some grand plan yourself when you were just as clueless as me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black jumped onto the bed with the blood bag and knelt by Ning Xiaoyao’s side. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“My clothes, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao lamented over the fact that she’d changed to fresh ones already before slapping the bag against her body. Once again, the scent of fresh blood filled the room, and Ning Xiaoyao plopped back down on the bed, pretending to play dead again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain asked uncertainly, “Is this enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao opened one eye to glare at him. “Then what else you do want me to do? Stab myself again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain hastily shook his head. If His Majesty really stabbed himself in front of his guard, then his big bro and the rest would definitely stab him as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Rain, Little Gao, both of you should get out,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “When you see the empress dowager, just stand there wiping away tears. If you can’t make yourself cry, at least make your eyes red. Little Gao, you can just pretend that I’m your---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao spun on his heel and left. </span><i><span style>He still wants to take advantage of me. My father at home is perfectly fine!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Take your acting seriously,” Ning Xiaoyao made a fist pump at Shadowrain to encourage him. Shadowrain rubbed his eyes in response. </span><i><span style>Fine, I’ll alright. As a follower of His Majesty, I should be able to do anything!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Once Shadowrain had left as well, Ning Xiaoyao met eyes with Big Boss Black, who scooted forward and licked the wound on her neck. “It must hurt a lot, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not too bad,” Ning Xiaoyao breathed. “Any pain was only fleeting at most. The empress really was brutal when she stabbed me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want me to bite her to death?” Big Boss Black asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao just sighed. “Black Tubby, let me remind you again. You’re a cat. Can’t you be a cute little kitty instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black wanted to claw her, but seeing that she’d just been injured, he held back. “The empress is a villain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn’t answer, but she patted his head silently. He’d never understand if she tried to explain things like human nature to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the length of time it took to burn a stick of incense, Empress Dowager Xie’s carriage stopped before the entrance to the courtyard of the main palace. She raised her head and peered at the grand sleeping quarters of Yongning’s generations of emperors and empresses. When the Yuanzong Emperor was still on the throne, she used to come here often. </span><i><span style>But now, </span></i><span style>she thought with a mocking smile, </span><i><span style>This place has turned so foreign that I don’t even recognize it, just with a change in masters. It’s as if I’ve never been here before.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain stood expressionlessly by Lou Zigui’s head and gave a slight nod. Lou Zigui told Empress Dowager Xie, “Esteemed Empress Dowager, His Majesty refuses to meet anyone, so we subjects can only wait here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie took a step towards the stairs. Outside the royal bedroom, Imperial Physician Gao was kneeling by the door. Once he caught sight of Empress Dowager Xie, he hastily lowered his head and bowed in greeting. Empress Dowager Xie stared at his red-rimmed eyes and asked, “Have you seen His Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao shook his head and said in a voice choked with sobs, “His Majesty won’t let anyone inside. This subject didn’t get to see him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie walked to the door and pushed it open. It swung in with a creak, but only revealed a crack. Immediately, the strong stench of blood assaulted her nostrils.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” Empress Dowager Xie called.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s mouth twitched as she laid on the bed. Big Boss Black licked his claws.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie called out a few more times without response, then told Imperial Physician Gao, “Call for someone to force this door open.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao looked up in alarm at the empress dowager, whose expression turned cold. “This is This Dowager’s decree. If His Majesty reproaches you for this, This Dowager will shoulder the blame.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao bowed towards Empress Dowager Xie before rising to run into the courtyard. He would need to have Supreme Commander Lou decide whether the woman could enter the chambers. Empress Dowager Xie stood alone in front of the bedroom door, her face finally showing traces of fear. </span><i><span style>If Ning Yu dies, what will I do then?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao asked Big Boss Black, “Will Supreme Commander let the empress dowager in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This cat doesn’t know,” Big Boss Black replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao scratched her palms before saying, “If the empress dowager comes in, I’ll have to pretend I’m almost dead. That’s pretty hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black grew perturbed. “How about this cat goes out right now and bite that empress dowager to death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao cradled her head in her hands. </span><i><span style>There’s no helping this fat cat.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black said, “Just give this cat a word. If you want the empress dowager dead, this cat will go out right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao could only reply listlessly, “Let me think it over first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re just too full of good intentions,” Big Boss Black expressed his disappointment. “You’re clearly the emperor, but now look! Anyone can bully you if they want! You’re a disgrace, miaow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glared at him. “Do you think I </span><i><span style>wanted </span></i><span style>to be emperor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black bared his fangs at her. “Even if you didn’t, you still took the position. What’s the use of bringing up such pointless things with this cat now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao laid on the bed and thought furiously over how to break through this obstacle! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Imperial Physician Gao had already reached Lou Zigui and reported in a low voice, “Esteemed Empress Dowager wants to go in and see His Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can that be allowed?!” Shadowrain blurted out first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao looked up at Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>Whether or not it’s permissible, you should say something ah, Your Excellency Supreme Commander.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go over to have a look,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao said, “If Supreme Commander goes in, Esteemed Empress Dowager will want to go in too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander,” an imperial guard ran over just then with a report. “The Grand Preceptor’s here. He’s requesting to see His Majesty by the gates.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So fast?” Imperial Physician Gao was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui told the guard, “Tell your commander to block him as long as you can.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The military officer muttered an assent and ran off. Shadowgale next spoke, “If the Grand Preceptor’s kept out, he’ll definitely transfer the troops from the military barracks to enter the palace. What will we do then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “We only need to defend Supreme Splendor Hall when the time comes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All four commanders of the Dragon Guards felt doubt at this decision. The military barrack soldiers outnumbered them multiple times over. Could they really hold the fort at Supreme Splendor Hall?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miaow,” came a sound from his feet. Lou Zigui looked down and saw Big Boss Black holding a handkerchief in his mouth while staring at him. Shadowthunder crouched down and tried to take the cloth, but earned a nasty scratch in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miaow~” Big Boss Black meowed at Lou Zigui. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui knelt down and offered his hand to Big Boss Black, who opened his mouth and plopped the handkerchief in Lou Zigui’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said the scratched Shadowthunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui lightly petted Big Boss Black’s head and stood up to read the words on the handkerchief.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hurry and find someone to impersonate my master.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The writing on the cloth was crooked and ugly, but they were unmistakably Ning Xiaoyao’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty really </span><i><span style>does </span></i><span style>have a master?” Shadowthunder murmured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s going to impersonate him?” Shadowrain asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao said, “Not me. The empress dowager’s already seen me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who amongst us </span><i><span style>hasn’t </span></i><span style>the empress dowager seen?” Shadowbolt asked Imperial Physician Gao. </span><i><span style>Scholars are supposed to be smart, but why’s this one so foolish?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It has to be someone she’s never seen before,” Shadowgale agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who do you think is appropriate?” Lou Zigui asked them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them stared back at him instead. </span><i><span style>You’re the one who made this mess, but now you don’t have any ideas?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui glanced at the Dragon Guards behind them, who all felt flustered by the sudden attention. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao said, “Supreme Commander, hurry and pick someone. It’s no good if Esteemed Empress Dowager’s kept waiting, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine,” Lou Zigui said, “She doesn’t have the strength to kick apart the door bolt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said everyone else. </span><i><span style>Now isn’t the time for you to look down on the empress dowager’s strength!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Meow~” Another meow came from the covered walkway, earning everyone’s attention. Now the long-furred Little White ran over with another handkerchief in its mouth. Lou Zigui’s mouth twitched before taking the cloth from Little White’s mouth. Everyone gathered around to read the new message written on the handkerchief.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ve already found a candidate for my master. Hurry and get over here, the empress dowager’s already pounding on the door!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who did His Majesty find to impersonate his master?” the second commander of the Dragon Guards asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, it can’t be an outsider, that’s for sure,” the third commander of the Dragon Guards remarked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, come with me,” Lou Zigui told Imperial Physician Gao before heading off. Big Boss Black and Little White both darted off towards the main palace as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the bedroom, Ning xiaoyao was trying to calm down a trembling Chef Huang. “Just pretend the empress dowager is a plate of vegetables. Don’t be afraid of her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But she’s the empress dowager!” Chef Huang exclaimed with a shiver.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re already my master, so what does the empress dowager count for?” Ning Xiaoyao said as she stretched the folding screen out to cover his figure. “Pretend she’s some vegetables, bring out your imposing manner as a chef.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang felt like peeing in his pants right now. “Your Majesty, this servant is </span><i><span style>only </span></i><span style>a chef.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And I’m only an emperor,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she straightened out the folding screen. “But I’m still acting all the same! Chubs Huang, you can do it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang was still shaking. “If Esteemed Empress Dowager recognizes who I am, I’ll die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not just you,” Ning Xiaoyao corrected, “We’ll all die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Chef Huang really was going to pee his pants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re a high-level master,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she set Chef Huang in an old-fashioned wooden armchair. “Just imagine you’re facing some vegetables. What would you do to them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang replied, “Wash them first, then chop them, then---then put them in a pot to boil.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bingo. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gave him a big thumbs up. “Right now, the empress dowager is a bunch of vegetables. Wash her and chop her, then put her in a pot to boil.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Chef Huang. </span><i><span style>But the problem is, Esteemed Empress Dowager isn’t any vegetables at all!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Just say that I’m at death’s door,” Ning Xiaoyao rehearsed his lines with him, “And that you can’t guarantee that I’ll survive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang stared at the bloody clothes that Ning Xiaoyao had piled by his feet and grew even more afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After that, you can just toss these clothes outside the folding screen,” Ning Xiaoyao continued to coach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T, then what if Esteemed Empress Dowager wants to come in?” Chef Huang refused to believe that a single folding screen would be enough to keep her out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if she does, you just sit there and don’t move,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Remember, she’s just some vegetables. Do you need to pay respects to your vegetables before you boil them in a pot?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang shook his head. He’d never heard of any chef who did such things with their ingredients.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then isn’t that fine?” Ning Xiaoyao gave him an earnest look. “You’ve said it before, the empress dowager’s never seen you before. What’s there to be scared of?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang wanted to cry. If he had known he was being summoned to do something like this, he’d never have admitted that the empress dowager had never seen him before! Was it already too late to take back his words? （╥﹏╥。)</span></p>
