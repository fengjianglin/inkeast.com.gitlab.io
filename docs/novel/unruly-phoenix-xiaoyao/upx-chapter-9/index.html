 <p>Chapter 9: Let him go, or else I'll strip&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie walked quickly up the execution platform and exclaimed, “Your Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned to face Grand Preceptor Xie. She had no good feelings towards the person who would ensure her death in the future, so she said, “Grand Preceptor, let’s stop this execution here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie almost turned stupid with rage at Ning Xiaoyao’s words. In order to get Lou Zigui on this execution platform, he’d used no end of mental and physical effort. </span><i><span style>Stop just because you said so? </span></i><span style>“Your Majesty, these pertain to national affairs,” he said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao only replied as a matter of course, “I know these are national affairs. Can’t an emperor like me take charge of them?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie was quick to add, “Your Majesty, please forgive me. This subject spoke wrongly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine,” Ning Xiaoyao was very broadminded. “It can’t be helped, you’re my maternal grandfather after all. You can even curse at me if you wanted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This subject doesn’t dare,” Grand Preceptor Xie could only say such words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have everyone fall back,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “I’m going to take Supreme Commander</span> <span style>away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness!” the Grand Preceptor’s tone grew serious as he yelled at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she really was Ning Yu, she would’ve known that this was a sign of her grandfather about to lose his temper. But Ning Xiaoyao had no way of knowing. Even if she did, it’d be impossible for her to fear him. “All of you wait here,” Ning Xiaoyao said to Lou Zigui and the rest. “I’ll go chat a bit with the Grand Preceptor. Young man,” she pointed her finger at Fang Tang. “Be careful of the arrows, protect Supreme Commander</span> <span style>well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang set his sword at a horizontal line as he stood in front of Lou Zigui. Meanwhile, Ning Xiaoyao walked towards the Grand Preceptor, who didn’t wait for her to speak before he said, “Your Majesty, do you know what you’re doing?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “Supreme Commander</span> <span style>was falsely accused.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t listen to hearsay from Fang Tang and those soldiers!” Grand Preceptor Xie said hastily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s the proof?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There were letters detailing dealings between the criminal and the royal palace of the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu</span></i><span style>,” said the Grand Preceptor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “Where did you get them from?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally, from the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu</span></i><span style>’s royal palace,” replied Grand Preceptor Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how do you know the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu</span></i><span style> weren’t just trying to sow discord?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “How hard is it to copy someone’s handwriting? For the sake of some vague letters, you instigated the populace into eating human flesh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... …” Grand Preceptor Xie was speechless. This granddaughter’s words had started out sounding reasonable, but did her final words make any sense at all?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to let him go or not?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If this subject doesn’t dare to, then what?” Grand Preceptor Xie countered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glanced at the sea of people beneath the platform before she shrugged her shoulders. “Then I’ll take off my clothes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie tottered back a few steps, looking as if he’d seen a ghost. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll count up to three for your answer,” Ning Xiaoyao said. This man had forced her into making a decisive move, so she’d go ahead and do it. So what if she took off her clothes? During the apocalypse, men and women could find a bed to tumble around in any time they found a pleasing partner. Moreover, she didn’t even need to strip bare to reveal her gender as a female.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“One.”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Two.”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty</span><i><span style>, ah!”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Three.”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Your Majesty!” </span></i><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie cried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao undid her button.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie never thought there'd be a day when Ning Yu left him at a loss for what to do. He who rode a tiger finds it difficult to dismount. If everyone discovered that Ning Yu was a girl, then everyone would know their Xie Clan had committed the crime of deceiving their sovereign. They’d die without even a place for burial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You'll die too!” Grand Preceptor Xie reminded Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao kept unbuttoning her buttons. She's already died once, so what was a second time? Everyone else watched in confusion as Ning Xiaoyao undressed herself. Even the smartest amongst them couldn't figure out what she was doing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right.” Grand Preceptor Xie said the words between clenched teeth as he saw Ning Xiaoyao finish with her buttons and prepared to untie her waist sash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stilled her hands to look askance at him. “You're not lying to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie didn't speak, but two figures like imperial guards emerged from behind him to stand by Ning Xiaoyao’s sides. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Protect His Majesty and escort him back to the palace,” Grand Preceptor Xie said.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tch!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao knew this old man wasn't easy to deal with! She reached out her hands and ripped her outer robes in half before the pieces fell to the platform. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hold it,” Grand Preceptor Xie hurriedly called out to the two guards when he saw Ning Xiaoyao about to rip her inner robes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let him go,” Ning Xiaoyao threatened, “Or else I'll strip!”</span></p>
