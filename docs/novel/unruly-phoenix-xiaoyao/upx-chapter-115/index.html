 <p>Chapter&nbsp;115: Ning Xiaoyao, don't cry<span class="hidden-text">&nbsp;Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui pointed at the stack of letters he’d put on the tea table. “These are letters from various local officials. They talk about money they’ve given, or officials they’re backing up, or subsidy fees paid for a courtesy call.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are subsidy fees paid for a courtesy call?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fees paid so they can meet with certain people,” Lou Zigui explained.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>In other words, an interview fee, </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao expressed her understanding. Yet still, she protested, “These are my things!” She pointed at the chests by her feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Supreme Commander worried that the Grand Preceptor will get angry?” Shadowgale asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “I’m not afraid of him. Just earlier, I even cracked his brains. That old geezer fell over with a face covered in blood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“..........” said Shadowgale and the rest. </span><i><span style>So His Majesty ran over to the Grand Preceptor’s estate to beat him up.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rested his forehead in his hand before he stood up and grasped Ning Xiaoyao’s hand. “Let’s talk in private.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s no use no matter what you say,” Ning Xiaoyao remained standing stubbornly in place. “The money and jewels are mine!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be good and listen to me,” Lou Zigui murmured in a small voice. When the Dragon Guards saw Supreme Commander Lou coaxing their emperor into another room like a child, they all swiveled to look at Shadowgale. </span><i><span style>Is Supreme Commander really treating His Majesty as his son?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I had Third Young Master Ning return to Fengzhou,” Lou Zigui explained his entire process with Ning Xiaoluo inside the room, as well as his arrangements and plans for the boy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was still stubborn in the beginning, but she slowly grew more shocked as the narrative went on. </span><i><span style>The Grand Preceptor wanted to kill Ning Xiaoluo just to worsen relations between her and the Duke of Yue’s estate? </span></i><span style>“Wasn’t it because our faces?” Ning Xiaoyao asked doubtfully as she pointed at herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re talking about faces, too?” Lou Zigui asked, mystified. “What’s wrong with Ning Xiaoluo’s face?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He looks a lot like me, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “The Grand Preceptor’s already found someone who looks exactly like me, and Ning Xiaoluo’s the backup. Isn’t that what’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say?” Lou Zigui said. “The Grand Preceptor found someone who looks exactly like you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Ning Xiaoyao answered. “He even turned him into an idiot. After he kills me off, he’ll probably make that idiot the emperor in my place. Then the Grand Preceptor will revive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s expression had sunk so low that he might as well be underwater. His chest felt stifled and unable to breathe. “This, this is massive news. Why didn’t you tell me?” he questioned sternly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “Aren’t I telling you now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme Commander Lou wondered whether Shadowgale would kill him now if he decided to beat up Ning Xiaoyao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Ning Xiaoyao backed away as she sensed the dangerous aura emanating from him. “Is this all that important?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui didn’t want to talk to her anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright,” Ning Xiaoyao scooted closer again and laughed. “I can restore that boy’s original face, so what’s there to worry about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can restore his face?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was only a face lift,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she gestured to her own face. “Since they used knives, it’ll leave incision marks. As long as I restore the incisions to their original state, that guy won’t look like me anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words sounded reasonable, but was that really possible? Lou Zigui wasn’t sure. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m a doctor--a very, very good doctor,” Ning Xiaoyao patted her chest with a promise. “As long as the patient’s not dead, I can cure any kind of illness!” Since there weren’t any zombies in this world, she wasn’t really boasting at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s heart lurched before he asked, “Then what about blindness and broken limbs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure!” Ning Xiaoyao agreed resolutely. If she couldn’t, then she would this time! She had to! </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Perhaps this was hope for his older brother? </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui stared blankly at Ning Xiaoyao, who dug her nails into her palms and tried to sound him out. “Has anyone been injured?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What happened to Lou Zigui’s older brother was part of his private affairs. It was still something painful, so she could only pretend that she knew nothing until Lou Zigui told her outright. You had to respect other people. After stressing the fact to herself once more, Ning Xiaoyao fixed an ignorant expression on Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme Commander Lou felt his throat get choked up before he murmured in a low voice, “I was just curious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, haha. You were curious,” Ning Xiaoyao was still wearing her simple, scatterbrained smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll take the imperial guards back to Fragrant Gauze Alley,” Lou Zigui drew Ning Xiaoyao close and helped wipe off her still-damp face. “Replace those things where you’ve found them, alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do I have to?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pouted so much that someone could hang a jug of oil off her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re only returning them temporarily,” Lou Zigui coaxed His Majesty Ning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the money’s not in our bags, then it doesn’t count as our money,” Ning Xiaoyao was still unhappy. She’d busied herself for half the night for nothing. (</span><i><span style>Author: Hey hey, is money the only thing you can remember?</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>What to do when a girl was unhappy? Lou Zigui raised a hand and smoothed out Ning Xiaoyao’s pout. “I promise I’ll get the jewels and silver drafts back for you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Hmph,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao humphed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As soon as next month arrives, we’ll go eat egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba,” </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui said next. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A vision of glistening gold yellow, fragrant, crispy egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>suddenly appeared in Ning Xiaoyao’s head. She slurped back her drool and said, “Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And thus, egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>cured His Majesty Ning of all of her ills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter what happens after this, don’t expose yourself,” Lou Zigui urged Ning Xiaoyao again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui hugged Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao grew serious. “We made a deal. Egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba.”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme Commander Lou felt crushed. Could it be that his hug was nothing compared to some egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: How should I say this….</span></i><span style>) </span></p>
 <p><span style>After the two differing minds came to the same agreement, Lou Zigui and Ning Xiaoyao emerged from the room. Ning Xiaoyao was staring at her toes, refusing to stare at the chests of treasure and stacks of silver drafts. If she saw them now, she’d physically ache. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui called in Fang Tang, who was standing guard outside, and said, “Go find some imperial guards and prepare to leave the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang answered in assent and ran off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui then told Shadowgale, “Bring some men to guard His Majesty as you travel to Fragrant Gauze Alley.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale nodded. They were going to cause trouble for the Grand Preceptor again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao crouched down and told Erya, “Erya, I’ll hoard a dowry for you another time. Right now, we have to return all these things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How come?” Erya asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glanced at the two chests with some distress. “Because we have to defeat the bad guys first. Erya, ah, grow up a bit slower. If you grow up too fast, I won’t have any money to give you for your dowry. Right now, Your Majesty’s very poor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It really was a tragic reason. Erya was a very good child, and replied, “Your Majesty, Erya won’t marry anybody. Let’s save up money to find a wife for Xiaoqiu instead. Xiaoqiu grows even slower than me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“..........” said everyone else. </span><i><span style>This little girl has foresight, too.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s right, Xiaoqiu needs money as well to start a family. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her eyes. She told herself, </span><i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao, don’t cry. You have to make sure you’re rich before Erya and Xiaoqiu grow up!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else watching the scene couldn’t help but feel that His Majesty seemed heroically tragic, for some odd reason. Lou Zigui simply turned and walked out of the room, unable to take any more. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting news that trouble had come to the Grand Preceptor’s estate, third son Xie Anshi forced himself to wait until the smoke and fires dissipated from the rockery formation before hastening back with his men on horseback. But it was then that a troop of imperial guards suddenly kicked their way in. They not only blocked off the back door, but the entire back alley. Some of the residents heard the commotion and opened their doors to have a look, only to be fiendishly shouted back into their homes by the guards.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Lou Zigui.” </span></i><span style>Xie Anshi spat as his face twisted upon recognized the man blocking the street. He gritted his teeth and said coldly, “Lou Zigui, what’s the meaning of this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impudence!” Fang Tang pointed a finger at Xie Anshi. “You’re only the vice-head of the Ministry of War, yet you dare to hail our Supreme Commander by name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anshi turned to Fang Tang. “And just what kind of thing are </span><i><span style>you?”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Go in and search,” Lou Zigui ordered the imperial guards while raising a hand to tell Fang Tang to keep quiet. The imperial guards dismounted their horses and swarmed through the doors of the estate. It was impossible for the Grand Preceptor’s men to keep them out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lou Zigui, just what are you doing?” Xie Anshi asked, furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui didn’t even look at Xie Anshi, but instead dismounted his horse and walked towards the doors. Fang Tang and the rest clustered around him like human shields. Xie Anshi had no choice but to dismount himself and chase after Lou Zigui. Privately, he wagered that news of the underground chamber had already leaked out somehow. Fortunately, everyone down there was already dead, so Lou Zigui was late by a step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao carried her giant bundle into the lampless study, pressed the switch, and opened the secret compartment. Then she replaced all the chests, letters, and silver drafts into their original places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a shame,” remarked Oil Jar, who had tagged along with Oil Lamp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sighed. “Yeah, what a shame. My body’s aching right this moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Lamp said, “Oil Lamp didn’t understand Supreme Commander’s words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar quickly nodded in turned, “Did you understand, Xiaoyao?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What Supreme Commander meant was that we have to let the Grand Preceptor think that Ning Xiaoluo’s already dead,” Ning Xiaoyao shut the secret compartment and reluctantly restored the area hiding the switch. Her conscience was quivering even as she ached. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How come?” Oil Jar still didn’t get it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because Supreme Commander wants to see the Duke of Yue’s estate have a fallout with the Grand Preceptor over Ning Xiaoluo’s fake death,” Ning Xiaoyao lowered her head as she walked out. “Supreme Commander says it’s called ‘meeting a plot with a plot,’”[1. </span><i><span style>meeting a plot with a plot </span></i><span style>(将计就计) - </span><i><span style>jiangji jiuji, </span></i><span style>or ‘to turn someone’s trick against them,’ ‘to beat someone at his own game.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But,” Oil Lamp raised a paw, “But doesn’t the Duke of Yue take orders from the Grand Preceptor to start with? Supreme Commander said the Grand Preceptor wanted to shift the blame of Ning Xiaoluo’s death to you, Xiaoyao. Did a bad cat gnaw out the Grand Preceptor’s brains?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A bad cat gnaws out the brains. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s mouth twitched. She’d learned a new turn of phrase from mice. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Oil Jar felt the whole thing was odd as well. “Xiaoyao, there’s no need for the Grand Preceptor to go to such lengths just to sow discord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “I told Supreme Commander the whole fuss was because of my face, but he didn’t believe me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar said, “But doesn’t the Grand Preceptor already have somebody who looks like you? Why did he need Ning Xiaoluo in the first place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Maybe he was worried that other guy would die halfway, so he had a backup just in case?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then,” Oil Lamp said, “Shouldn’t the Grand Preceptor be worried that the Duke of Yue will recognize his son if he’s used as a replacement for you instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao squatted on the floor of the covered walkway as she scratched her head in thought. “That’s true.” No matter how loyal the Duke of Yue was to the Grand Preceptor, he’d still be able to recognize Ning Xiaoluo if he was made to be a stand-in for Ning Xiaoyao. Faces weren’t so easily forgotten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar said, “The Grand Preceptor must have another plot on hand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What could it be?” Ning Xiaoyao solicited the two mice for advice. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar and Oil Lamp didn’t have any answers for that. Oil Jar said, “Xiaoyao, you humans are so complicated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao nodded. “That’s right, those humans are way too complicated. Even I can’t understand them.” (</span><i><span style>Author: You’re a human too, ah! Wake up already!</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Lou Zigui was standing at the foot of the fake rock formation that Ning Xiaoyao had mentioned. As Lou Zigui stood in the heavy downpour, he saw that the formation was made up of stacks of Jiangnan lake rocks. But there were no visible traces of the fire that had supposedly swept through the rockery tunnels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, Xie Anshi had followed them here as well. He watched Fang Tang enter through the stone door in the rock formation’s cave and said to Lou Zigui, “There was a fire in the basement just a while ago. If Supreme Commander came to put out the flames, I’m afraid you’re a little too late.”</span></p>
