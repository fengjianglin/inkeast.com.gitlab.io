 <p>Chapter&nbsp;174: (Title at End of Chapter)&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time General Deng Rong[1. </span><i><span style>Deng Rong </span></i><span style>(邓荣) - </span><i><span style>Deng </span></i><span style>is simply a surname, </span><i><span style>Rong </span></i><span style>means “glorify, luxuriate, flourish.”] of the Black Frost Cavalry had left through the southern gates of the palace, Little Peach Blossom was already a long ways off. The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>who had escorted her out of the palace was long gone as well. Deng Rong felt that it wouldn’t be good to murder someone too close to the palace, so he simply ended up following Little Peach Blossom from a distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Peach Blossom didn’t stop to take a break until she heard the sounds of a crowd up ahead. This meant that she was already far from the palace. After catching her breath, Little Peach Blossom adjusted the bundle on her shoulder before walking forward again. Deng Rong, on the other hand, preoccupied himself with how to kill the girl in front of him. She was such a petite girl that he could kill her with a single thumb without ever drawing his saber. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Peach Blossom’s heart finally sank back in her chest after slipping into the crowded city streets. </span><i><span style>I should be safe here, right? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A few children ran past her, one of them holding a pinwheel. The sight of it momentarily distracted Little Peach Blossom. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Rong stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man dressed very much like a refugee suddenly rushed out from under the awning of a nearby shop and ran to Little Peach Blossom’s side. His right hand struck at Little Peach Blossom’s waist while his left snatched the bag off her shoulders. He fled as she fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Rong stopped walking. </span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time the people around Little Peach Blossom recovered their wits, they saw the girl already had blood dripping by her feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“M-murderer!” a woman shrieked. Some of the men ran in the direction of the fleeing assailant, but he weaved and twisted his way through the crowds until he quickly vanished from sight. Little Peach Blossom pressed her hands against the wound on her waist, but blood seeped through her fingers all the same. Soon a red puddle had pooled beneath her body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Rong parted the crowds and crouched down by her side to murmured, “I had orders to come after you, but someone made their move before I had a chance to strike.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Peach Blossom widened her eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You chose the wrong master,” Deng Rong said. </span><i><span style>How would the empress dowager ever be kind enough to spare a court lady who’d ruined her plans? </span></i><span style>As it turned out, this was all an elaborate play to showcase her mercy before her subordinates. In the end, she still wanted this court lady dead. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Rong looked unsympathetically at Little Peach Blossom and said, “Windy is a good man. If you had told him the truth from the start, you wouldn’t have ended up like this.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>When he was finished speaking, he stood up and turned to leave. Meanwhile, people in the streets were calling for a doctor. Little Peach Blossom’s hand pressing against her wound gradually began to lose strength.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Told him the truth from the start? Back then, I still had dreams of flying up to the branch and becoming a phoenix. </span></i><span style>How could a man like Shadowgale ever enter her eye in the past? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss, hold on a bit longer, the doctor will be here right away,” a good-hearted woman shouted at Little Peach Blossom. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Two streams of tears flowed down Little Peach Blossom’s face. </span><i><span style>It was all nothing but a beautiful delusion. I ended up being nothing more than a pawn in the fight between the empress dowager and His Majesty.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss?” a few women surrounded Little Peach Blossom as they called out to her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Head Commander Shadowgale still doesn’t know my real name, </span></i><span style>Little Peach Blossom thought to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a clinic right on this road, so the doctor on duty was quickly pulled over by the surrounding passerby. The crowd parted to make way while urging him to save Little Peach Blossom. As the doctor bent down, he saw all the blood staining the ground. Then he raised a hand below Little Peach Blossom’s nose to test her breathing before shaking his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This girl has already passed away,” he told the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The women around Little Peach Blossom fell into a daze. One of them finally recovered enough to reach out a hand and shut the girl’s eyes, only to find that she must have died with lasting regrets in her heart. No matter what she did, those pair of eyes refused to shut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is she?” another woman asked. Everyone exchanged glances. None of the girls’ relatives or kin had shown up to look for her, so was this girl all by herself? </span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the older woman patted Little Peach Blossom’s body up and down before she sighed. “She must have incurred retribution for her sins. There’s nothing on her body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many others in the crowd joined her with their signs. </span><i><span style>No kin and not a single identifying document on her body to tell us her name or where her family’s from. </span></i><span style>Then the only thing they could do was have the officials toss her body in the barren hills to be a lonely ghost. A man dressed in a short jacket squeezed his way out of the crowd and ran quickly in the direction of the palace. Soon enough, the attendants of the Nine Gates Infantry Commandery arrived. They personally checked Little Peach Blossom’s breathing, then frisked her body one last time, before tossing her unidentified corpse onto a cart and hauling her away. Most of the people in the streets had a healthy dread of government officials, so none of them dared to ask whether they caught the original killer. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Rong returned to Supreme Splendor Hall and reported his findings. He and Lou Zigui stood under the covered walkway before he finally said, “That bloke looked quite skilled. The empress dowager has people like that by her side?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui asked, “Did that person see you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Deng Rong replied. “This soldier hadn’t even made any moves. I was standing quite far from the girl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked at the gardens beyond the walkway. By now, the sun was setting in the west, and a group of young eunuchs were following the lead of their senior to light the lanterns in the palace grounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander,” Deng Rong asked, “Isn’t there something fishy about all this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “Even if this man doesn’t meet with the empress dowager personally to report his deed, he’ll have someone send a message in his place. Go search for him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Rong’s gaze turned chilly. “And after I find him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui made a chopping motion with his hand, indicating his unspoken answer. Deng Rong accepted his orders and turned to leave. Two eunuchs stopped near Lou Zigui with firestarters in their hands, afraid to approach him. Lou Zigui glanced up at the colored glazed lamp above him and beckoned at the two little eunuchs before he went inside to look for Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Ning Xiaoyao was sitting in her room with Erya, each of them holding a file in their hands. They were rubbing off the royal insignias on some vases, the screeching of metal against copper enough to drive people mad. Lou Zigui entered the room and told Erya, “Go look for Xiaoqiu, it’s almost dinnertime.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erya obediently ran off with a half-filed brass vase in her arms. Ning Xiaoyao was still sitting there with her head bowed, rubbing and rubbing away. </span><i><span style>I’ll file this away, file this away, file, file, file this away~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at her nearly empty rooms, Lou Zigui settled to sit by her side and murmured, “Are you planning to sell off everything in Supreme Splendor Hall?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded. </span><i><span style>That would be the best, ah. I’m only afraid that I won’t be able to clear the place.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “That court lady named Little Peach Blossom, she’s dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stopped filing and looked at Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t want her to die?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shrugged. “I don’t care either way. Fourth Lightning said she tried to drag Windy down with her, so it doesn’t matter to me whether she lives or dies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The empress dowager rewarded her in her palace and had her sent away, before ordering someone to kill her outside in the streets,” Lou Zigui added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was stunned. </span><i><span style>The empress dowager even knows how to kill people in so many different ways? </span></i><span style>She opened her mouth to curse, “That little bit---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui muffled her instantly. “You can’t curse her wantonly, she’s your mother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Ning Xiaoyao pried off Lou Zigui’s hands with a pout. “She’s my old ma, your mother!” The last two words were meant as a curse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let Little Peach Blossom turn into ancient history,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Don’t mention her again in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui nodded. He assumed that she would ask him why he’d sent someone to follow her in the first place, but she didn’t say a peep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are we eating tonight?” Ning Xiaoyao asked instead. Lou Zigui felt his mouth twitch. </span><i><span style>That’s always been the most important question for Miss Ning.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>The residence of the empress dowager was quite dim after dinner. Even the empress dowager herself only had a single lantern lit in her quarters, its faint yellow light only illuminating a small circle of space. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Empress Dowager, news came in from outside the palace. Little Peach Blossom is dead,” the eunuch bowing in front of the empress dowager reported.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie’s face was full of scorn as she cursed under her breath. “That worthless slut.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The eunuch remained silent with his head bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Reward him,” Empress Dowager Xie said. “And have him keep a close eye on the Grand Preceptor’s estate for This Dowager as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eunuch asked, “Is empress dowager worried about the Grand Preceptor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Worried?” Empress Dowager Xie echoed coldly. “He doesn’t need This Dowager to worry about him. This Dowager simply wants to understand one particular thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eunuch raised his head slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t trust anyone in this world,” Empress Dowager Xie said, “It’s better for This Dowager to rely on myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eunuch quickly dropped his head again. “Empress dowager speaks rightly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can withdraw,” Empress Dowager Xie said. “Be careful not to let His Majesty catch you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eunuch muttered an assent before withdrawing from the palace. Empress Dowager Xie took off the </span><a href="http://mydramatea.com/2013/03/13/zhzm3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>nail sheath</span></a><span style> from her left index finger and played around with it in her hands. But then she suddenly threw it at the floor. The pure silver sheath clattered against the ground with a loud, clear ring. Though the court ladies and eunuchs stationed outside the room all heard the sound, none of the dared to take a peek inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie stared at the rest of her nail sheaths. She couldn’t simply be a sitting duck under these circumstances. If this went on, both her and Ning Xin would die by Ning Yu’s hands before her son ever had a chance to grow up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Empress dowager?” a </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>voice called from outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come in,” Empress Dowager pulled off her remaining nine nail sheaths and tossed them on her couch. The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>muttered an assent and entered the room. This was the agent that Empress Dowager Xie had planted in the empress’s quarters. She waited until the woman finished her bows before saying, “You may rise now. Has something happened to the empress for Chen </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>to seek out This Dowager?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>intoned, “Empress dowager, recently the empress has been favoring sour foods. This servant witnessed her throwing up multiple times as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie had been leaning against her seat, but now sat bolt upright. “What are you implying with those words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>said, “This servant isn’t able to get close to Esteemed Empress, but this servant can tell from a distance that Esteemed Empress is much plumper than before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Preference for sour foods, vomiting, and weight gain. Are you trying to tell This Dowager that the empress is pregnant?” Empress Dowager Xie asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>said, “This servant dares not confirm it, because Esteemed Empress said that her period had come again today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Yu was female, so how could she ever get the empress pregnant? Empress Dowager Xie stared at Chen </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>and said, “Has the empress asked for any nourishing soups to bolster her body recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>replied, “Empress dowager, even if Esteemed Empress drinks such soups, she’d never let this servant know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Dowager understands,” Empress Dowager picked up two of her nail sheaths and told Chen </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>“This is your reward.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>accepted the gift before bowing down to express her thanks and leaving. On the rafters, Oil Jar said to Grandpa Ash in a frantic tone, “What do we do? The empress dowager knows that Esteemed Empress has a baby, ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandpa Ash was very calm. “At present, she only suspects it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar said, “But her suspicion means that she’ll send someone to investigate, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go find Xiaoyao,” Grandpa Ash said. “It’s her wife. If she won’t take care of her, who will?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar’s expression grew stern at his words. “Xiaoyao is Supreme Commander’s wife, oh~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Grandpa Ash. </span><i><span style>A wife who has a wife of her own, what do you call this situation?</span></i></p>
