 <p>Chapter&nbsp;87: Request from a daughter of the Ji Clan<span class="hidden-text">&nbsp;Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao munched and crunched on her egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>as she looked at Ji Yuerong with a self-satisfied expression--despite the fact that it was the latter who’d help to pay for her food. “Tasty?” she asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Miss Ji saw Ning Xiaoyao staring at the half of the </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>in her hands, she simply stuffed the entire thing in her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Did she think I’d steal her share?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad,” Ji Yuerong said as she swallowed the </span><i><span style>guoba. </span></i><span style>Then she took a look at the stall and made a mental note of its location, so she could come here next time and buy some more. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“They were the last ones,” Ning Xiaoyao said, savoring the taste of egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba</span></i><span style> in her mouth before its last traces disappeared. “If you want to buy them again, you’ll have to wait ‘til next month.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quietly, Miss Ji erased the memory of the stall location from her mind. Meanwhile, Shadowgale had been standing woodenly behind them. Now he offered the egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>in his hands to Ning Xiaoyao. Her eyes grew wide at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still wearing his wooden expression, Shadowgale said, “Your Majesty, this servant doesn’t like to eat things like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong smiled mockingly. This was the first time she’d seen someone wearing an expression like that while acting like a toady. Ning Xiaoyao reached out to take the </span><i><span style>guoba, </span></i><span style>because she really did want another one. But at the same time, the snow wolf pup jumped out from her robes and bit into the </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well dang,” Ning Xiaoyao snatched it back. The </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>was a brittle and crispy snack. As human and wolf fought over the snack with their hand and mouth, it snapped in half in the grown man’s hand. Shadowgale grabbed the wolf pup just in time before the snack-thief tumbled to the ground. Meanwhile, Ning Xiaoyao stuffed her stolen </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>into her mouth and crunched on the remnants before batting the wolf pup on its head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re a wolf, and you’re still eating </span><i><span style>guoba?” </span></i><span style>Don’t all wolves eat meat? Did this wolf pup’s mother abandon him because he was a picky eater? (</span><i><span style>Author: You’re overthinking it. </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o) The little wolf pup chewed on its </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>without sparing Ning Xiaoyao a single look. He allowed her to bat his head as she wished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Ji Yuerong. </span><i><span style>So that was a wolf.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Eldest lass.” Ji Jiu rushed over just then on his horse, with his troops in tow. Ning Xiaoyao and the rest all lifted their heads to look at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” Ji Jiu quickly dismounted his horse at the sight of Ning Xiaoyao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to bow,” Ning Xiaoyao held on to Ji Jiu before he started kneeling in the streets. Because she’d used her hands to eat the </span><i><span style>guoba, </span></i><span style>her oily fingers managed to stain Old General Ji’s sleeves as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Jiu looked around them until he found that Shadowgale was the only one guarding Ning Xiaoyao. He asked in worry, “Your Majesty only took along the head commander to protect you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not it, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are the rest of the Dragon Guards?” Old General Ji asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The rest, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao pointed towards Lady Xiang’s house. “We caught a Northern </span><i><span style>Hu…”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Shadowgale’s voice cut off Ning Xiaoyao’s words before he lowered his head to whisper in her ear. “This servant thinks it’ll be better to tell the details to other people after we’ve interrogated the woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, so it’s like that,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded without thinking twice. “Sure, whatever you say.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What Northern…” Ji Yuerong wanted to ask, but Ji Jiu lightly pulled her behind him. If His Majesty didn’t want to say, then they shouldn’t pry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you guys come out to go window shopping?” Ning Xiaoyao asked Ji Jiu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Jiu was quick to answer. “To reply Your Majesty, this subject and the rest wished to meet with Supreme Commander, but he wasn’t at the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Oh, you wanted to see Supreme Commander, ah. He went to see Prince Zhi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old General Ji’s eyebrows furrowed slightly. Why did Supreme Commander Lou wish to entangle himself with the likes of Prince Zhi, Ning Guangyuan?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao continued, “Then why don’t we go find a place to chat?” She’d promised she’d treat the Ji grandfather and granddaughter to a meal once, so she had to stick to her word. When she recalled how she had no money, she turned to whisper in Shadowgale’s ear. “Windy, go get some money. I want to treat them to a meal.” Shadowgale muttered an assent before he quickly disappeared into the crowd. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With His Majesty offering the invitation, how could mere subjects such as they refuse? Ji Jiu bent over and said, “This subject accepts the decree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which restaurant in the capital city has good food?” Ning Xiaoyao asked the Ji pair seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said the Ji grandfather and granddaughter duo. </span><i><span style>Your Majesty, what are you thinking? Why are you asking us when we’re from the borderlands?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “I heard that the Drunken Immortal place on this street is pretty good. Shall we go there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said the Ji duo. </span><i><span style>If you already knew where to go, why ask us in the first place?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Without conversation, there was only silence. Ning Xiaoyao felt very please as she lead Ji Jiu and the rest to the Drunken Immortal. She’d inspected all the restaurants and inns on this street before determining that the Drunken Immortal had the cheapest prices! (</span><i><span style>Author: So, Your Majesty, your standard for treating someone to a meal is finding the cheapest place to eat? </span></i><span style>orz)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon enough, everyone was sitting together in an elegant dining room. Ji Jiu felt out of sorts, while Ji Yuerong was ill at ease. Yongning had always valued its civil officials over its military ones, so as warriors, they had few chances to sit with His Majesty at the same table for a meal. All four generations of the Ji Clan had been soldiers, but this was the first time anyone from their family had eaten with the emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come on, order some dishes,” Ning Xiaoyao said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Jiu was too afraid to even speak. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “I’m treating you guys, you know? Old gramps, order whatever you’d like! Windy went to get money, so don’t worry. I won’t piss off before I pay the bills.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Piss off? </span></i><span style>Even the the waiter in the room found it painful to hear such words. Since there was no way to get the better of Ning Xiaoyao, Ji Jiu picked up the menu and read through it once before carefully selecting a table full of dishes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>While they were waiting for the food, Ji Yuerong asked Ning Xiaoyao, “Why did Your Majesty invite we subjects out to eat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “Because I want to be friends with you guys, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Jiu rose to his feet before kneeling in front of Ning Xiaoyao. Was there ever a subject who had befriended his emperor? Ning Xiaoyao’s expression stiffened. </span><i><span style>Does this mean we can’t be friends?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong simply sat there unmoving, completely stunned again. She didn’t even realize what she </span><i><span style>should </span></i><span style>be doing at this moment. Ning Xiaoyao simply hauled Ji Jiu up from the ground and said, in a rather hurt tone, “Old gramps, you don’t want to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Jiu was terrified. “This subject doesn’t dare.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Doesn’t dare? That means he doesn’t want to, then. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt awful as she set the old gramps in a chair by her side. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Old General Ji privately marvelled at His Majesty’s brute strength before he spoke. “Your Majesty, a sovereign differs from his subjects. Your Majesty can simply order your subject if there’s anything to be done. A subject will never begrudge a sovereign who tells him to spill his liver and brains on the ground.”[1. </span><i><span style>spill his live and brains on the ground </span></i><span style>(肝脑涂地) - </span><i><span style>gannao tudi, </span></i><span style>the actual meaning of this idiom is “lay down your life.”]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Old gramps, why spill your liver and brains on the ground? Your sons and grandsons have been injured enough.” Because Ning Xiaoyao had brought up the subject without any warning, both Ji Jiu and Ji Yuerong were caught off guard. When they recovered from their shock, Ji Yuerong’s eyes had already turned red and teary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When there’s a chance, I’ll pay them a visit,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she poured Ji Jiu a cup of water. Without seeing the people first, she didn’t dare promise that she could cure them. After all, they’d been injured for at least four years now and her skills were a far cry from their original strength in the apocalyptic world. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Jiu rose to kneel again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t,” Ning Xiaoyao pressed him down. “If you have any requests, old gramps, just bring them up to me. If I can manage it, I’ll definitely do them for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Ji Jiu was a military officer. He wouldn’t hide his feelings like the civil officials and simply stared at Ning Xiaoyao in surprise. In his Ji Clan, the members were either aging or disabled. All they could do was rely on this granddaughter of his to support their family status. Even if they had soldiers under their command, they were still stationed at the distant borders. What had His Majesty taken a fancy to from his Ji Clan? He looked at Ning Xiaoyao, then at Ji Yuerong, before this old gramps seemed to tremble. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>His Majesty fancies Yuerong?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Old gramps?” Ning Xiaoyao shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Ji Jiu was still sitting in his chair as he spoke. “This subject’s granddaughter has played with spears and staves since her youth. She’s not good with poetry or literature, and her looks are ordinary at best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whaa?” Ning Xiaoyao widened her eyes before pointing at Miss Ji. “</span><i><span style>Her</span></i><span style> looks are still ordinary?” </span><i><span style>Then what about mine? Am I a criminal dragging down the average attractive index for humans?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This subject’s granddaughter needs to bring a son-in-law home,” Old General Ji came clear out to Ning Xiaoyao, who gave Ji Yuerong a sympathetic look. At this rate, there’d be no hope for the girl to be matched with Supreme Commander.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!” When Ji Jiu saw Ning Xiaoyao staring at his granddaughter, he couldn’t help but feel jumpy and shout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Your Majesty really wants to help the military officials with matters,” Ji Yuerong spoke up, “Then this soldier has a request.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t help you with Supreme Commander,” Ning Xiaoyao replied immediately. Ji Yuerong balled her hands into fists, while Ning Xiaoyao simply sat there unmoving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You cannot be impudent!” Ji Jiu told his granddaughter. Currently, Shadowgale was holding onto the snow wolf pup while standing outside their private dining room. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aroo?” the wolf pup barked at the door, before Shadowgale heartlessly stuffed him back into his clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong bit her lip and looked at Ning Xiaoyao, her expression stubborn. “Can Your Majesty help the wife of the Xie Clan’s eldest son annul her relationship with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wh-whaa?” Ning Xiaoyao didn’t understand. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong rose to her feet forcefully, sending her chair flying backwards before she kneeled in front of Ning Xiaoyao. Ning Xiaoyao jumped out of her chair. After coming to this world, she found it extremely annoying that people kept bowing to her for no reason whatsoever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big sister Qin’s[2. </span><i><span style>Big sister Qin </span></i><span style>(秦家姐姐) - </span><i><span style>Qin jia jiejie, </span></i><span style>there’s no familial relation here, Ji Yuerong simply considers this girl to be as close as an actual sister.] clearly being tormented by the Xie family, but there’s no way for this lowly soldier to help her,” Ji Yuerong said loudly. “Your Majesty, the Qin Clan had also sacrificed many loyal martyrs for the cause. Big sister Qin is one of the last surviving members of the Qin Clan. Please take pity on her and help her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hold on, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao helped Ji Yuerong up as she spoke. “Is this wife of the Xie Clan’s eldest son from the Grand Preceptor’s estate?” </span><i><span style>No way, right? It’s not like what I think, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Ji Yuerong broke apart Ning Xiaoyao’s delusions with one word.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>In that case, this big sister Qin must be the wife of that Xie Anyi. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao couldn’t help but think that she had no end of conflicts with the Xie Clan. Otherwise, why would she keep bumping into their business wherever she went?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Xie Clan bullies big sister Qin merely because she’s an orphan,” Ji Yuerong’s face was red from her anger. “That Xie Anyi dotes on his concubine but wants to destroy his proper wife. He keeps big sister Qin in an empty room without paying her any attention. If the Qin Clan’s uncles and older brothers were still alive, how would the Xie Clan dare to treat her like that?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “In other words, after Xie Anyi married your big sister Qin, he changed his mind and fell in love with another woman instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” Ji Yuerong laughed coldly. “When big sister Qin married into the Xie Clan, that man’s son was already one month old. It’s the child of the girl he likes, his younger female cousin from the Wang family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He already had a woman and a baby, but still went ahead to marry your big sister Qin?” Ning Xiaoyao furrowed her eyebrows. “Isn’t he swindling her with that marriage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong’s expression grew disdainful. “Their Xie Clan only wanted her so they could take control of the Qin Clan’s naval forces. With a navy, they can do whatever they like without fear in the southern </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangnan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>Jiangnan</span></a><span style> regions.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So Yongning even has a navy. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao learned another fact about the country. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Jiu glanced at Ning Xiaoyao. A navy was only useful in places where there was water, such as the rivers and seas. Such forces were completely unnecessary for the capital city. Would a young emperor like him offend the Xie Clan yet again just for some tiny, useless navy?</span></p>
