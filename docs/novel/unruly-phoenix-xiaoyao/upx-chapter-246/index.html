 <p>Chapter 246: Supreme Commander adds details mid-way&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie knew that now wasn’t the time to retreat. Even if </span><i><span style>she </span></i><span style>was more to blame than that slut née Zhou, she couldn’t admit defeat. For the sake of her son, she had to stand firm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Dowager wants to see His Majesty,” Emrpess Dowager Xie said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui nodded slightly. “This subject will report your request to His Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When has This Dowager’s desire to see His Majesty ever needed the likes of an outer official like you to take part?” Empress Dowager Xie immediately questioned sternly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui knew what she was thinking. Mothers rose in strength in accordance with their sons. Even if this woman had hit a dead end, she would fight to the last for the sake of Prince Cheng, Ning Xin. </span><i><span style>Still, </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui thought as his eyes flashed sinisterly, </span><i><span style>If you want to live, it’ll only be after I let you.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This Dowager wants to see His Majesty!” Empress Dowager Xie pointed her finger at the imperial guards. “This Dowager is His Majesty’s mother. What are you all doing? Are you planning to revolt just because His Majesty was attacked by an assassin?!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Kill.” </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui’s voice was soft, but it sounded unmistakably cold beneath the summer sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Empress Dowager Xie was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale suddenly raised his sword and sliced the two eunuchs by his feet, killing them both. As shrill screams filled the air, the imperial guards all attacked with their swords to silence the cries. Corpses soon littered the grounds of the courtyard, soaking its ornamental slabs with blood. The brilliant hues of the summer flowers paled in comparison with the crimson liquid, which seemed to dye the entire world scarlet. Its raw, metallic stench filled Empress Dowager Xie’s nostrils and made her gag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui was still standing as still as a quiet pine, completely indifferent to the blood pooling at his feet. He looked at Empress Dowager Xie and stated, “This subject suspected these servants to be accomplices of the assassin. For the sake of Esteemed Empress Dowager and Prince Cheng’s safety, this subject had them all executed. Now His Majesty can tend his wounds in peace.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You,” </span></i><span style>Empress Dowager Xie backed away a few steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They might be assassins too,” Lou Zigui said, “This subject had no other choice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie held onto a pillar for support as she stared at him, then at the dead bodies on the ground and the troops who refused to kneel at the sight of her. She suddenly realized that now wasn’t a matter of retreat, but of what Lou Zigui was planning to do to </span><i><span style>her </span></i><span style>instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Drag the bodies away,” Lou Zigui ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The imperial guards picked up the corpses by one ankle and hauled them off with no fanfare. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you withdraw,” Lou Zigui told the rest of the soldiers. Shadowgale took the lead to take them out of the courtyard. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Empress Dowager Xie managed to keep herself upright with the pillar as she spoke. “This Dowager wants to see His Majesty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui took a few steps forward, causing her to back away again. Meanwhile, the </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> holding Ning Xin was still scared speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you planning?” Empress Dowager Xie backed all the way into the rooms before quickly retracing her steps again, her voice shrill. “Lou Zigui, you dare to kill This Dowager?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s lips curved up into an icy smirk. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s not the one who wants to kill me, </span></i><span style>the empress dowager suddenly thought, </span><i><span style>It’s Ning Yu. </span></i><span style>“Where’s Ning Yu?” she cried desperately. “Does he plan on killing his mother?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked at her without a word. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He wants This Dowager dead,” Emrpess Dowager Xie grew agitated. “Then he better not plan on surviving, either. He’s---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wahhhh! Wah, wahhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The words </span><i><span style>‘a girl’ </span></i><span style>died on Empress Dowager Xie’s lips as Ning Xin’s wails filled the air. Her son’s voice was like a bucket of ice water over the empress dowager as she recovered her wits. If she got in a life-and-death struggle with Ning Yu now, what would become of Ning Xin? Was he supposed to die with them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s hand was resting on his sword. If the empress dowager had really blurted out the emperor’s true gender, he was prepared to kill her right then and there. Now that Empress Dowager Xie had stopped talking, he quirked another grin and murmured, “What fine skills, Esteemed Empress Dowager.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie’s eyes flickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty was severely injured,” Lou Zigui continued. “The empress didn’t use poison, but a dagger to stab His Majesty in the neck.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-what?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty refused to let any doctors treat the wound,” Lou Zigui went on. “And shut himself in his bedroom, refusing to come out. Right now, the only thing I know is that he’s seriously injured, because I smelled a lot of blood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie suddenly lost all energy from her body and toppled back against the wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If His Majesty doesn’t make it this time,” Lou Zigui continued murmuring with a level stare, “Then I believe Esteemed Empress Dowager should know who stands to benefit the most.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the rooms, Ning Xin’s wailing continued. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who benefits the most if Ning Yu dies? If Ning Xin takes the throne as a baby, then the mother will be killed to leave the son. With him so young, the Grand Preceptor will act as regent and become the sole ruler at court. Who benefits the most? Of course, it’ll be my father.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s one more thing that Empress Dowager might not be aware of,” Lou Zigui added. “The Grand Preceptor delivered Zhou </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>headless body to Iron Buddha Temple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie first assumed that the empress was conspiring with Ning Yu, but now she assumed that the woman could only have been instigated by the Grand Preceptor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the Grand Preceptor promised to protect the safety of the Zhou siblings,” Lou Zigui went on, “Then I believe the empress would have trusted him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie slowly straightened up with a curse. </span><i><span style>“Slut.”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “Esteemed Empress Dowager better pray that His Majesty can survive this unharmed. Otherwise, no one will be able to protect you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If something happens to His Majesty, would any good come to </span><i><span style>you?” </span></i><span style>Empress Dowager Xie challenged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Worse comes to worst, I could simply leave,” Lou Zigui said calmly. “Before the new emperor takes the throne, I could depart the capital city for Anyuan. With its six provinces and the Black Frost Cavalry under my hands, the Grand Preceptor wouldn’t be able to touch me even if he claims all power in court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie just shook her head and mocked, “</span><i><span style>This </span></i><span style>is the extent of your loyalty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui wasn’t affected. “As long as His Majesty is still alive, my life is his. Even if His Majesty commands me to die, I will do it without objections.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do it without objections?” Empress Dowager Xie echoed coldly. “And if His Majesty dies instead, you’ll just choose to walk away from the problem?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally, I’ll seek revenge for His Majesty’s sake,” Lou Zigui said. “But that means I’d have to survive first. A dead man can’t do anything, wouldn’t you say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the rooms, Ning Xing’s sobs had dwindled to soft whimpers. Empress Dowager Xie heard this and suddenly said, “Why should This Dowager believe you? You said His Majesty’s been attacked, but what makes that fact?” Here was the man who’d just ordered 20 or so of her servants killed. How could she trust him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It doesn’t matter whether or not Empress Dowager believes me,” Lou Zigui said. “I’m not concerned with Empress Dowager’s future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie choked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor will enter the palace very soon,” Lou Zigui added. “I’ll block his way. That’s the only thing I can do for His Majesty now.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He won’t let the Grand Preceptor seize the chance to control the courts while Ning Yu’s injured, then? </span></i><span style>Empress Dowager Xie’s thoughts were currently in a mess. She couldn’t trust anyone or see through anything anymore. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“As long as His Majesty is fine, then Empress Dowager can continue to live,” Lou Zigui finished before turning to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hold it,” Empress Dowager Xie called after him and stepped forward. “This Dowager wants to see His Majesty once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui turned back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If things really are as you say, then This Dowager will help you keep the Grand Preceptor out,” Empress Dowager Xie added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui creased his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But before This Dowager helps you, This Dowager </span><i><span style>must </span></i><span style>see His Majesty once,” Empress Dowager Xie insisted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Empress Dowager isn’t afraid that the Grand Preceptor will bring his troops into the palace as well?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if His Majesty can’t speak, This Dowager can,” Empress Dowager Xie said coldly. </span><i><span style>As long as Ning Yu has o single breath of air remaining, the Grand Preceptor can dream on about leaving the son and killing its mother!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s body turned sideways as he acknowledged her words. “Alright. This subject invites Esteemed Empress Dowager to come with me to Supreme Splendor Hall.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Now he’s ‘this subject’ again, </span></i><span style>Empress Dowager Xie stared at Lou Zigui before descending the steps. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“With the imperial guards here, nothing will happen to Prince Cheng,” Lou Zigui promised before the empress dowager could mention it. She headed out the courtyard at that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, is Supreme Commander teaming up with the empress dowager now?” Oil Jar asked Grandpa Ash in confusion from the flower beds. “Doesn’t Supreme Commander hate the empress dowager?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandpa Ash only shook his head. “This is called a mutual deception. They’ll try hook and crook for the sake of their goals and even turn friends into enemies, enemies into friends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar only felt dizzy at the words. “Ancestral Grandfather, doesn’t this mean Supreme Commander’s a villain now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s not a villain,” Grandpa Ash answered. “But he’s not a hero, either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Oil Jar was even more confused. </span><i><span style>Not a villain or a hero? Then what </span></i><b><i>is </i></b><i><span style>he?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oil Jar,” Grandpa Ash’s paw patted him on the head. “After living a while, you’ll discovered that humans can’t simply be divided into ‘good’ and ‘bad.’” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humans are too complicated,” Oil Jar sighed. </span><i><span style>A little mouse like me doesn’t get it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale and the rest were astonished to see Empress Dowager Xie emerge from her courtyard. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Escort Esteemed Empress Dowager to Supreme Splendor Hall,” Lou Zigui ordered Shadowgale. “Empress Dowager wants to visit His Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, Shadowrain had already reached them as well. All four commanders of the Dragon Guards glared at Lou Zigui at the same thing. </span><i><span style>This wasn’t part of the plan.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Does This Dowager even need the permission of you servants now before I can see His Majesty?” Empress Dowager Xie actually burst out laughing from her fury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Wind, Thunder, Rain and Lightning commanders all exchanged glances. </span><i><span style>Should we join Supreme Commander in his insanity?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>After changing into new clothes, Ning Xiaoyao went back to lying on the bed and snacking on sugar beans. When she wanted to talk, she could find all sorts of topics to talk about, so Imperial Physician Gao had no choice but to keep her company despite wanting to find a quiet corner to adjust his thoughts. Their chats ranged from who would win in a fight between Supreme Commander and Shadowgale, to which restaurants were the most famous in the capital city, to why Imperial Physician Gao had yet to beget a daughter despite being married for so long with a son already in the family. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao first thought of dying when they first started talking, then thought of killing Ning Xiaoyao first before himself as time went on. Just when he was about to give out, Shdaowrain rushed in with an urgent tone. “Your Majesty, Supreme Commander’s decided to ally with the empress dowager to face off against the Grand Preceptor. He’s bringing her here to check on your injuries!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao blinked, then asked Imperial Physician Gao, “Did I hear wrong? Third Rain just said that Supreme Commander’s allying with the empress dowager?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao nodded woodenly at Ning Xiaoyao. “Your Majesty didn’t hear wrong. This subject heard the exact same words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao clutched her head. </span><i><span style>What’s going on now? How can we add details to our play mid-way?!</span></i></p>
