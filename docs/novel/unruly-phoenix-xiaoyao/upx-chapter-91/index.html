 <p>Chapter&nbsp;91: Cruelty, fulfilling true love<span class="hidden-text">&nbsp;and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could they tolerate something like this? Ning Xiaoyao wanted to fight Lou Zigui, but he simply picked her up until her feet were off the ground. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao,” he said softly, “If you take née Qin out of the Grand Preceptor’s estate, Xie Wenyuan will send assassins after Qin Xuan right afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whaa?” Ning Xiaoyao exclaimed. “Then I’ll kill off that old geezer first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because it was the middle of the night, Ning Xiaoyao’s shout brought the Dragon Guards and Fang Tang with his men all running. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine,” Lou Zigui told the crowd. “You can all withdraw.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rob and plunder his house, </span><i><span style>mmph--” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s lips were muffled by Supreme Commander Lou’s hand once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be good,” Supreme Commander Lou said as he carried off Ning Xiaoyao. Fang Tang stared at his Supreme Commander’s retreating form, then at His Majesty’s legs kicking in the air. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander looks like he’s raising a son,” young General Fang sighed with feeling. The general standing next to him smacked him upside the head. </span><i><span style>This guy, he never thinks before he speaks! What kind of subject treats the emperor as their son? Does he want to condemn Supreme Commander to death!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m only joking,” Fang Tang rubbed at his aching head with a brilliant smile. “Supreme Commander’s age doesn’t match with His Majesty, right?” His Supreme Commander wasn’t old enough to have a child as old as His Majesty yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said everyone else. </span><i><span style>This guy is really a dimwit. No wonder he was a “hero” bold enough to charge into the palace and cause His Majesty to faint away.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At the end of the covered walkway, Ning Xiaoyao was making an uproar. “If you don’t let go of me, I’ll bite you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui sat with Ning Xiaoyao on a banister and said, “Do you want to force the Xie Clan to raise their troops and revolt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They can revolt all they like,” Ning Xiaoyao snarled, “I’m not afraid!” She’d risked her life in fights against zombies before, so what was an old man and his rebellion?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remember, once war starts, many people will die,” Lou Zigui held onto Ning Xiaoyao without letting go. “Suppose the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>take that chance to invade while Yongning’s fighting amongst itself? Xiaoyao, even though you want to help née Qin and Qin Xuan, you have to make sure they can live first, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Ning Xiaoyao. She couldn’t do as she liked anymore!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Endure it for one more night,” Lou Zigui said, “Once Qin Xuan’s safety is assured, we can bring out née Qin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sat huffily on Lou Zigui’s legs before she finally said, “You said it yourself, just one more night. No matter what I do tomorrow, you’re not allowed to stop me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Lou Zigui agreed. Winning Qin Xuan over to their side would mean breaking off the Xie Clan’s path to riches in Jiangnan. Why would he stop her for that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First it’s Qin Xuan here, then Qin Xuan there,” Ning Xiaoyao tilted her head to look at Lou Zigui. “Why do I feel like you think General Qin’s more important than Miss A’Xin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was up to Lou Zigui to choose, Qin Xuan would always be more important than Qin Xin. Even if Qin Xin couldn’t survive the night and died in the Grand Preceptor’s estate, the commander of the Jiangnan navy would still be Qin Xuan. In terms of importance, was there any other choice? Despite thinking this way, Lou Zigui didn’t voice his thoughts aloud. Neither did his expression reveal anything. He simply whispered in Ning Xiaoyao’s ear, “They’re both important.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her ears because Supreme Commander Lou’s breathing had made her ticklish.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you have née Qin annul her relationship, you’ll be violating the late emperor’s decree,” Lou Zigui added. “Xiaoyao, have you really thought this over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn’t know what words she could use to describe the late emperor now. </span><i><span style>Really, was Grand Preceptor Xie your true love all along? You even gave out such a perverse imperial decree? Oh wait, that’s not right. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt stifled as she recalled that the mistress of the empress dowager’s palace was the real true love of the late emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He was completely blind!” Ning Xiaoyao cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The late emperor was deceived by the Xie father and daughter as well,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh,” Ning Xiaoyao chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve really thought it over?” Lou Zigui asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stood up and straightened her back. “My Imperial Father sent me a dream tonight saying that Xie Anyi was a no good rascal, and to rescue Miss A’Xin. Anyone who doesn’t believe me can ask my Imperial Father personally. I’ll even send them on their way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Lou Zigui. He had no way to counter her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to see the empress,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “If there’s nothing else, you should go rest, Supreme Commander.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you seeing the empress for?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do I need a reason to visit my wife?” Ning Xiaoyao arched an eyebrow towards Lou Zigui, who wanted to </span><i><span style>heheh </span></i><span style>as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m off,” Ning Xiaoyao stuffed a sugar bean in Lou Zigui’s mouth before she turned and ran away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Sweetness filled his mouth as Lou Zigui touched the place on his lips where Ning Xiaoyao’s finger had brushed against. He couldn’t describe his feelings at this moment. When Fang Tang hurried over, he gave a start at the grin on Lou Zigui’s face. What was wrong with his Supreme Commander? Why...</span><i><span style>why does he have such a, urk, gentle-looking smile?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” At the sight of Fang Tang, Lou Zigui’s upturned lips returned to its usual line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s news from the Hall of Punishment,” Fang Tang said in a rush. “That Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>woman wanted to go to sleep and no one can shout her awake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If shouting doesn’t work, use torture,” Lou Zigui said. “Can’t the torturers find ways to keep a person awake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, then should I make a trip?” Fang Tang asked. When Lou Zigui nodded, Fang Tang turned and ran off. Lou Zigui sat on the banisters and stared at the night sky for awhile before rising to trace Ning Xiaoyao’s footsteps. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the palace, Ning Xiaoyao took her hand off Empress Zhou’s shoulder after determining that her baby was growing very well. She quietly nodded her head and said, “Have a seat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Zhou was feeling too uneasy. She’d been called over to Supreme Splendor Hall in the middle of the night. “Did Your Majesty summon this empress for anything in particular?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao could tell that Empress Zhou was nervous, so she patted her shoulder to comfort her. When she saw that only made the empress more anxious, she spoke up. “That there,” Ning Xiaoyao awkwardly removed her hands. “Tomorrow, you should summon all the wives of the various subjects into the palace. Have their husbands accompany them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Zhou felt conflicted. </span><i><span style>I thought I was going to die, and here you are telling me these kinds of things.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You should especially invite those from the Xie Clan,” Ning Xiaoyao added. “You have to have them come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Zhou gave a start at the mention of the Xie Clan. She lowered her voice and asked, “What Your Majesty means is that all of the Xie Clan’s young masters and wives should be summoned into the palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm. Doesn’t the Grand Preceptor have three sons?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We’re only inviting the first wives.</span></i><span style> Empress Zhou suddenly realized what was going on. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“As for the other important subjects, you be the judge,” Ning Xiaoyao added. “The more, the better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is Your Majesty planning to do upon inviting them to the palace?” Empress Zhou asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Screw over a jerk,” Ning Xiaoyao explained tersely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Empress Zhou. Though she had no idea what the words meant, they sounded pretty impressive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, right. If we put it that way, none of the Xie Clan will dare to enter the palace,” Ning Xiaoyao twirled in place. “How about we say it’s my birthday?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The empress’s expression was a little stiff as she spoke. “Your birthday is on the second day of the first month of a Lunar new year. Right now, it’s the fourth month.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Alright, that excuse won’t work. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked towards the empress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if reading her mind, Empress Zhou replied, “It’s not my birthday tomorrow either, nor is it Esteemed Empress Dowager’s birthday.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who wants to celebrate </span><i><span style>her </span></i><span style>birthday?” Ning Xiaoyao whispered under her breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Zhou simply pretended not to hear a thing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let's just say I got something delicious so I’m treating them to a meal,” Ning Xiaoyao thought up another excuse. (</span><i><span style>Author: Your mind only revolves around topics like these. </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o) Empress Zhou accepted the excuse. Then again, what could she ever say to oppose the emperor?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui saw the empress leaving the side palace by the time he went in. The first thing he heard was Ning Xiaoyao’s voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Rain, invite Miss Ji into the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right this instant?” Shadowrain asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain wanted to say, </span><i><span style>Your Majesty, if you invite Miss Ji to the palace in the middle of the night, will anyone still marry her in the future?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on,” Lou Zigui told the irresolute Shadowrain as he walked in. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain didn’t know why, but he feared Lou Zigui where he didn’t fear Ning Xiaoyao. After hearing those words, he left without saying a thing to summon Ji Yuerong to the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve thought it over,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she stuffed more sugar beans into her mouth. “What I’m going to do tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui sat down to listen to Ning Xiaoyao’s plan. In the flower beds outside, elder cousin magpie remarked to Wifey Magpie, “Xiaoyao’s pretty fierce.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could she be an emperor if she wasn’t fierce?” Wifey Magpie asked reasonably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Big Boss Black piped in. “This cat would rather Xiaoyao bully others than to see others bully her, miaow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is née Qin’s location in the Grand Preceptor’s estate?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “I’ll have elder cousin magpie bring Yuerong there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Him,” Ning Xiaoyao said, pointing towards the flower beds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>︿(￣︶￣)︿ , went elder cousin magpie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui fell silent. “Did Your Majesty raise him?” Next to the magpie was that fat black cat. It was the first time Supreme Commander Lou had ever see a magpie and cat so close together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urk, yeah,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rested a hand against his forehead. “Keep going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations on becoming an imperial bird,” all of the little animals in and out of the flowerbeds told elder cousin magpie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” went elder cousin magpie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One hour later, Ji Yuerong entered the palace along with her worried grandfather, Ji Jiu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come, come, come,” Ning Xiaoyao beckoned to the pair. “We’re going to have a meeting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The meeting took an entire night, with more members joining in as it progressed. Finally, even a few generals from the imperial guards were called in to participate. By the time Ning Xiaoyao looked towards the brightening skies outside the windows, her tone had turned more solemn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now I’m announcing the start of our plan. Our goals are to screw over that jerk and fulfill true love. Anyone else has anything to add?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said the group. </span><i><span style>What evil-sounding words. What else can we add? It’s impossible to follow up after that.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing else,” Lou Zigui replied in answer to Ning Xiaoyao’s stare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s move out,” Ning Xiaoyao made a big wave with her hands. The group scattered to busy themselves with their various tasks. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>After receiving Empress Zhou’s orders, the eunuchs carrying invitations to the palace were the first to leave its gates with their deliveries. Ji Yuerong brought a team of Dragon Guards with her to depart Supreme Splendor Hall. On her way to Grand Preceptor Xie’s estate to save her big sister Qin, she asked Ning Xiaoyao, “Your Majesty, suppose Xie Anyi tries to take my big sister Qin to the palace?” </span><i><span style>If that’s the case, won’t I run there in vain?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao had no doubts. “He won’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His Majesty Ning could guarantee it on her character and moral integrity. Xie Anyi, that jerk. </span><i><span style>He. Definitely. Wouldn’t!</span></i></p>
