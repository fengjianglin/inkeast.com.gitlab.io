 <p>Chapter 219: Did Supreme Commander give you his promise?&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li bowed towards Ning Xiaoyao and said, “Your Majesty, this subject will take his leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great, ah, great,” Ning Xiaoyao stuck out her head from behind Lou Zigui. “Have a good trip, old gramps. Farewell, old gramps!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li backed up three steps before turning his back and leaving. Although he executed his formal bow perfectly, the Lord Protector could tell that the man seemed light-headed and swayed when he walked, as if he was stepping on cotton. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Li really is getting on his years,” Ning Xiaoyao remarked to Lou Zigui after the man walked out of the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said the Lord Protector. </span><i><span style>Is this really an issue of age?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui patted Ning Xiaoyao’s head. Elder Li didn’t like the sight of him, nor did he in turn. He didn’t want to talk much about Elder Li at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Supreme Commander, are you hungry? Let’s go eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector didn’t hear Ning Xiaoyao dismiss him, so he asked, “Is Your Majesty planning to leave this subject for the meal as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s expression blanched before she glared at him. “What? You want to eat here, oh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector turned dumbfounded when he saw His Majesty stare at him like a hated enemy. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still owe </span><i><span style>me </span></i><span style>a meal,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she continued to glare. </span><i><span style>Trying to get free food out of me while still owing me himself?! Anyone who makes this Majesty spend money now is my husband-snatching foe!</span></i><span style> (</span><i><span style>Author: Enough already, you. Where’s your so-called husband? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector didn’t understand what Ning Xiaoyao was so angry about, so he asked, “Then, shall I invite Your Majesty to the Lord Protector’s estate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately, Ning Xiaoyao stopped glaring and was all smiles. “That’s possible, yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector’s eyes twitched at the abrupt transformation. </span><i><span style>Could it be that His Majesty was telling the truth when he said he was very poor? He can’t even get a good meal, so he always looks delighted when others treat him out to eat?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no time today,” Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao to his side before she could run off again. He added in a lower voice, “Something might happen on Prince Fu’s side. It’s unlikely the imperial clansmen will be so docile.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao suddenly felt that there was no more love left in this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector said, “His Majesty can take care of national affairs at the Lord Protector’s estate, too. Supreme Commander, you---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stared at the Lord Protector, who inexplicably felt a chill and shut up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s inadvisable to leave the palace right now,” Lou Zigui turned back to Ning Xiaoyao after he had made the Lord Protector docile. “Maybe in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was thinking the same thing as the Lord Protector. Even if her uncle, Prince Fu, ended up brawling with his clansmen, it wouldn’t make a difference whether she was in the palace or the Lord Protector’s estate. But it was clear that Lou Zigui didn’t want her to go, so between delicious food and Supreme Commander Lou, she grudgingly chose the latter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remember, you owe me a meal,” she told the Lord Protector, who only looked between her and Supreme Commander Lou.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I wasn’t imagining things, there really is something going on between them! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui had Ning Xiaoyao sit down before he poured her a cup of water. Then he turned to the Lord Protector and said, “Tao Yu’s gone to East Ji, so I’ll have to trouble the Lord Protector for matters back at the military barracks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector hastily asked, “Supreme Commander wants me to enter the barracks?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui nodded. “Your Lord Protector’s estate has plenty of troops too. Many of them are in East Ji, so you can summon them to the capital.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this to improve things for our Lord Protector’s estate’s men? </span></i><span style>The Lord Protector looked towards Ning Xiaoyao, who was currently munching on a sugar bean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing his look, she replied, “Mhm, listen to what Supreme Commander says.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector had a new understanding of Supreme Commander Lou’s favored position. He was simply deciding things for His Majesty, ah. “So I’ll go to the military barracks and become Chen Lu’s deputy general?” the Lord Protector asked Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you please,” Lou Zigui bowed slightly to him. As the respected Lord Protector of the country, it really was a step down to be Chen Lu’s subordinate at the military barracks. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector hastily waved his hands. “It’s no trouble. As long as I can be of service to His Majesty, then it’s fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should go back and make preparations,” Lou Zigui said. “His Majesty will set the decree at the next morning assembly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Some of our Lord Protector estate’s men are getting on in their years,” the Lord Protector recalled just then. He was about to go, but found it better to clarify some details. “Supreme Commander, are they useful as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If they’re old, don’t they have sons or grandsons of their own?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector looked towards Ning Xiaoyao, who swallowed the sugar bean in her mouth. “Mhm, just do as Supreme Commander says. As long as they can fight, they should come. I don’t mind having more people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This subject accepts the decree,” the Lord Protector was all smiles now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go home and eat,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Remember you still owe me a meal.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Still that meal… </span></i><span style>The Lord Protector’s smile stiffened before he suddenly asked, “Your Majesty, why did you send Tao Yu to East Ji? This subject is a soldier as well. Was Your Majesty planning to place this subject into the military barracks even back then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “That’s not it, ah. Back then, I just happened to spot General Tao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the Lord Protector took his leave, he felt lightheaded as well. </span><i><span style>Just happened to spot him? Can you use people like that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Really,” Ning Xiaoyao told Lou Zigui. “I just happened to see Tao Yu then instead of the Lord Protector.” If she’d see him, she’d definitely feel conflicted about her choices.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector left the hall with heavy steps. </span><i><span style>So as it turned out, I only missed the chance for leading troops to war because His Majesty never noticed me. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go eat,” Ning Xiaoyao jumped out of her chair once the Lord Protector was gone, pulling Lou Zigui away with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “Xiaoyao, how did you think of pushing Prince Fu to step forward?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because Fenglin City belongs to him, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just because of that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about spending money to get rid of all the calamities?” Lou Zigui asked next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because we’re dealing with refugees, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao explained. “If they have enough food, what kind of refugee would still want to risk death and revolt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm.” Ning Xiaoyao nodded. </span><i><span style>Who’s going to raise a rebellion for no reason when their bellies are full?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pulled Lou Zigui out of the side palace and towards the main audience all. By now the weather had gotten hotter, and the rays of the sun were piercing as they shone beneath the eaves. Lou Zigui looked up at the skies beyond, which were approaching summertime. Still, the light didn’t banish the gloomy cant to his pupils.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander,” Ning Xiaoyao swung Lou Zigui’s hand in her own. “What do you want to eat later?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui dropped his head, his gloomy eyes replaced with laughing ones. “Xiaoyao.” Standing in the deserted walkway, he placed both of his hands on her shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Ning Xiaoyao was all smiles as she thought of food. Lou Zigui lowered his head to peer at her, causing her to swallow her sugar bean. “Supreme Commander, do you have something else to say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black swished his tail from behind them. </span><i><span style>Is Supreme Commander going to kiss that ninny again? Can they stop abusing a cat like this? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: What do humans’ affairs have to do with you? </span></i><span style>(￢_￢) )</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao, I hope there’ll come a day when you don’t hide anything from me,” Lou Zigui said in a small voice. Ning Xiaoyao blinked before scratching her palms. </span><i><span style>What did I hide?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll wait,” Lou Zigui said as he cupped her face in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought it over before asking, “Supreme Commander, what things are you talking about? Can you give me a reminder?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t force you,” Lou Zigui smiled at her before taking her hand. “Let’s go eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After following him a few steps, Ning Xiaoyao blurted out, “I have supernormal abilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s steps halted. Ning Xiaoyao was very nervous. </span><i><span style>Please don’t think I’m some sort of freak! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui had heard of able-bodied soldiers, but what was ‘supernormal?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, I can also understand the speech of animals,” Ning Xiaoyao said next. Since she was going to tell the truth, she might as well say everything. She and Supreme Commander had already tumbled in the sheets together and might stick together even more in the future. It wasn’t good to always be so dishonest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rested a hand against his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s true, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao ran in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Lou Zigui started to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t believe me, I’ll show you,” Ning Xiaoyao waved at Big Boss Black. “Black Tubby, come here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black sat on the walkway without budging an inch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If not, then roll over,” Ning Xiaoyao said next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black gave a yawn before sprawling on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “Didn’t you say we were going to eat? Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You damned Black Tubby!” Ning Xiaoyao raged at him. “You’re doing this on purpose, aren’t you? You want your Supreme Commander to think that I’m a liar so he’ll dislike me?” </span><i><span style>Why didn’t I notice what a malicious bastard this fat cat was?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black lazily rose to his feet, gave a long stretch, and jumped off the walkway and fled. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph!” Ning Xiaoyao was completely cross and prepared to give chase. </span><i><span style>One of us is definitely going to die today!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright,” Lou Zigui hooked his arms around her waist and pulled her back. “I believe you. Now let’s go eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Is this the attitude you should be showing if you believe me? Stop changing the subject!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The distant sound of footsteps approached them then, causing Lou Zigui to release Ning Xiaoyao and step away. Soon enough, a Black Frost Cavalry general arrived. He first bowed to Ning Xiaoyao, then respectfully reported to Lou Zigui, “Supreme Commander, someone from the Ministry of War’s arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go meet with them,” Lou Zigui told Ning Xiaoyao softly. “You go eat first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao deflated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll have someone buy you egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>later,” Lou Zigui added. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Can egg yolk guoba help my hurt feelings? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao puffed out her cheeks before sticking up two fingers at Lou Zigui. “Two </span><i><span style>jin.</span></i><span style>”[1. </span><i><span style>Two jin </span></i><span style>- approximately two pounds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Lou Zigui smiled warmly before turning to leave with the general. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stood alone in the walkway before raising her foot to stomp the ground. She’d told the truth, but Supreme Commander didn’t believe her, ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miaow,” Big Boss Black peeked out from the flower beds beyond the walkway and leaped back on the balustrade. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh, you still have the guts to show yourself?” Ning Xiaoyao’s hand rushed forward like lightning and pressed Big Boss Black down as she prepared to beat him up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao,” Grandfather Sparrow flew onto the balustrade as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Tubby ruined me” Ning Xiaoyao tattled immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandfather Sparrow’s expression was stern as he looked at her. “Xiaoyao, you can’t let Supreme Commander know your secret yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whaa?” Ning Xiaoyao gave a start.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black took this chance to wiggle out of her grasp and said, “You ninny, have you married Supreme Commander yet? How could you just tell him anything you like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandfather Sparrow added, “Xiaoyao, did Supreme Commander give you his promise?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sat on the railings and blinked. “What promise, ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That he’ll be with your forever and ever, and protect you, and raise you, and something about growing white hairs together,” Big Boss Black meowed at her. “He hasn’t promised you anything yet, so how could you tell him your secret?”</span></p>
