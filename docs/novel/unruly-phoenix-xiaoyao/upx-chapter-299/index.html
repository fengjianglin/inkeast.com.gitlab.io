 <p><span style>Chapter 299: First Young Master Ning said, “Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao picked up the white jade crown. </span><span style>Ning Xiaomu and Shadowrain went over to Ning Xiaoyao’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After weighing the white jade crown with her hand, Ning Xiaoyao affirmed, “It must be hollow inside.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>First Young Master Ning took the crown from Ning Xiaoyao's hand. He examined it from top to bottom before starting to twist the gilded top from the left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain poked his head out to get a better view and whispered, "There's something inside!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pursed her lips. She also noticed something was stuffed inside the crown.&nbsp;</span><span style>First Young Master Ning carefully pulled out rolls of letters from within the crown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ning Xiaoyao saw the traditional Chinese characters, she felt dizzy. So, she only shot a brief glance at it before asking First Young Master Ning, "Big Bro Ning, what does it say?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaomu took a cursory glance at the letter and handed it back to her. He lowered his voice, "This is a letter from Xie Wenyuan to His Highness, the second prince."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s hand began to shake when she heard the three words, </span><i><span style>Xie Wen Yuan</span></i><span style>. </span><i><span style>Why is he everywhere ah?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Ning Xiaoyao did not read the letter, First Young Master Ning added, "Grand Preceptor said that Prince Cheng is too young and he doesn’t want to watch the empress dowager go through misfortune. So, he will try his best to assist Second Prince to become the emperor."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was in a daze for quite some time. "Did Second Prince seriously believe Grand Preceptor’s words?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaomu lowered his head to stare at the unconscious Second Prince lying on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>"He can’t be </span><i><span style>that</span></i><span style> stupid, right?" Ning Xiaoyao was in disbelief. “Second Prince is willing to work under a person who dares to kill an emperor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He may not believe it, but this at least gives His Highness some hope," First Young Master Ning replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"T-then, the reason why he deliberately came to stir up trouble today was to help Xie Wenyuan?" Shadowrain stuttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao did not understand. “How does having an argument with me help Grand Preceptor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaomu suddenly lifted his head and asked Shadowrain, "What happened to those who came to the palace with Second Prince?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They’re still waiting outside the palace gate." answered Shadowrain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, please dispatch the troops to raid Second Prince’s estate,” Ning Xiaomu firmly stated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whaa?” Ning Xiaoyao opened her mouth wide, stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you remember what we talked about earlier, Your Majesty? What happens to the capital when there is instability in the imperial household?” asked Ning Xiaomu. Ning Xiaoyao looked at him. </span><i><span style>Of course, she remembered.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Regardless if Second Prince escapes the capital today to take refuge with Imperial Concubine Jing or not, rumours of the princes being displeased with His Majesty will spread around the capital." First Young Master Ning explained in a low tone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"How does that benefit him?" Ning Xiaoyao asked, pointing at Second Prince.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There’s no benefit to him if Your Majesty is alive," Ning Xiaomu whispered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao: ... </span><i><span style>That’s true</span></i><span style>. </span><i><span style>After being alive for so long, she completely forgot to confer a title for Second Prince.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Your Majesty!" Shadowrain called out softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Umm, I know you feel sorry for me, Third Rain," Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her nose. "I'm alright."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How do you want to deal with Second Prince?" Shadowrain asked. </span><i><span style>As long as His Majesty gives him permission, he’ll immediately kill him!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao lifted her foot and kicked Second Prince several times without saying a word. </span><i><span style>She’ll beat him up first to vent out her anger.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaomu instructed, "Keep it under wraps for now. Right now it’s not the time to cause more trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn’t you suggest raiding his estate?" Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaomu said, "Grand Preceptor’s men should be the ones who search and confiscate his family’s property."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dang!</span></i><span style> Ning Xiaoyao took a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What do you think, Your Majesty?" First Young Master Ning wanted Ning Xiaoyao’s input.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mm, that’s fine." Ning Xiaoyao nodded. </span><i><span style>If she’s merciful to the enemy now, she’ll be ruining herself!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain accepted the decree and brought his people out the palace gate. Just as he was about to leave, he heard someone calling him from behind. Shadowrain turned around and saw that it was Ning Xiaomu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain ran up to him. "First Young Master, does His Majesty have another order for me?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Everyone must be killed in Second Prince’s estate," First Young Master Ning lowered his voice. "Remember, leave no one alive."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain was astonished. "This is His Majesty’s..." </span><i><span style>Even if you beat him up, Shadowrain wouldn’t believe His Majesty would make such a decree.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>First Young Master Ning waved his hand to stop Shadowrain from speaking. &nbsp;"This is my idea. Remember this, Xie Wenyuan is the one who did the killing."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Would bystanders believe our words?" Shadowrain asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Right now it doesn’t matter whether they believe it or not," First Young Master Ning gazed at Shadowrain and continued in a low voice. “It’s fine as long as some people in the capital are afraid of the consequences of supporting Grand Preceptor. The message I want to get across is that they may die if they support Xie Wenyuan.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But just because they kill Second Prince, it doesn’t mean Grand Preceptor Xie would kill the common people, ah! </span></i><span style>While Shadowrain was trying to figure it out, First Young Master Ning continued, "Do you know Second Prince’s followers?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain nodded. The followers were merely the advisors of the estate. In addition, there were also a few officials who were supporting Second Prince because they wanted to have an established position in the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Select a few convenient subordinates and get rid of them." Ning Xiaomu commanded. Looking at the eldest son of Duke of Yue’s estate, Third Shadow Commander truly did not understand. </span><i><span style>How could this young master still look so gentle and elegant while talking about slaughtering others?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Dragon Guards dare to kill people, right?" First Young Master Ning said, "If not, I can dispatch the Destruction Prisoner Army."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain stroked the knife that was hanging around his waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"His Majesty would most likely be against this decision. But I think this is beneficial to him. Those in the capital would join forces to fight against one common enemy. So whether His Majesty stays or leaves the capital, he won’t have to worry about getting shot in the back by an arrow. Understand?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Shadowrain's scheming abilities were incomparable to those of First Young Master Ning. After hearing his words, Third Shadow Commander felt that Ning Xiaomu’s words were reasonable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Third Commander?" Ning Xiaomu gave Shadowrain an amiable look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand.” Shadowrain turned and quickly walked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaomu stood at the palace gate. He could hear Shadowrain ordering the Elite Imperial Guards to change their attires. When he heard someone behind him calling “big brother!”, First Young Master Ning turned his head. Behind him stood Ning Xiaoluo with a face that was totally unrecognizable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother,” Third Young Master Ning looked outside the palace gate and whispered, “Are we going to assist His Majesty in the war?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Young Master Ning asked, "Are you afraid?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm not afraid," Ning Xiaoluo hastily shook his head. "I'm just concerned about the lack of men we have. If we knew this from the start, we should’ve brought more troops with us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Young Master Ning laughed. </span><i><span style>If they had brought the whole Destruction Prisoner Army with them, would Xie Wenyuan have let them into the capital? He was already suspicious of the Duke of Yue’s estate harboring ulterior motives. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother, do you think His Majesty will be able to win this time? I’ve asked around. Miss Ji said that Xie Wenyuan has tens of thousands additional soldiers in his hand, that’s more than His Majesty and Lou Zigui’s forces combined!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Young Master Ning walked towards the direction of the imperial palace while his younger brother chased after him. "Big brother, with such fewer troops, can His Majesty really win?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"As long as big brother is here, you won't meet with any mishaps," First Young Master Ning patted his younger brother on the shoulder. "Your face is so swollen. You should focus on healing. Don't worry about fighting in the war."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo...</span><i><span style>He felt like a disposable item. Could someone tell him whether he was overthinking? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Where is Miss Ji now?" First Young Master Ning asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"She's keeping His Majesty company at the moment. Supreme Commander Lou asked her to stay with His Majesty."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaomu nodded. He no longer spoke and continued walking straight ahead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-----</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong watched as Ning Xiaoyao stuffed her mouth with food in the palace room. She was concerned. "Your Majesty, eat slower. What if you choke?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao swallowed down a bowl of rice in three mouthfuls. </span><i><span style>She has no time to eat slow! Right now, she has to replenish her energy as fast as she can so that she’ll be prepared to throw cannons again if necessary!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Chef Huang was watching from the side. "Is this still not enough?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Not enough," Ning Xiaoyao declared, “Bring me another pot."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miss Ji and Chef Huang’s mouth began to twitch. They had never heard of anyone who wants to get second helpings in pot size!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why hasn’t Big Bro Ning returned yet?" Ning Xiaoyao asked as she stuffed her mouth with rice again. "Did he leave the palace with Shadowrain?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s not worry about that heir of the noble house for now," Miss Ji’s mouth was still twitching. "His Majesty, why don’t you eat some veggies?" </span><i><span style>What kind of person only eats plain rice without any other dishes? Is it a type of condition?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, First Young Master Ning followed the four Dragon Guards who were carrying Second Prince. At the same time, Ning Xiaoluo was still following closely behind him. "Big brother, where are the four Dragon Guards taking Second Prince?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You know that he's Second Prince?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, &nbsp;everyone from Supreme Splendor Hall is aware that the five princes came to create trouble for His Majesty. We all know His Majesty beat up Second Prince."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We can’t let too many people know about it?" Ning Xiaoluo hurriedly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, it’s fine," said Ning Xiaomu. "They are going to the Hall of Punishment."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then are we also going to the Hall of Punishment?" Ning Xiaoluo asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo fell behind his big brother. He thought about it over and over again, but was still clueless. </span><i><span style>Why are they going to the Hall of Punishment?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Second Prince woke up while they were still on the way. However, he was unable to move or speak because he was tightly tied up with rope and his mouth was stuffed. Four Dragon Guards were carrying him. When Second Prince was carried into the prison cell, he fell to the ground and made two sounds with all his might.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Young Master Ning came inside the cell and smiled at the four Dragon Guards. "Leave the cell and wait for me. I have something private to say to His Highness, the second prince."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Come out," Shadowrain spoke from outside the prison cell.&nbsp;</span><span style>The four Dragon Guards quickly left the scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Young Master Ning crouched down and took out the cloth that was stuffed in Second Prince’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ning Xiaomu," The moment Second Prince could speak, he threatened First Young Master Ning. "By acting like this, you’re not afraid Grand Preceptor will punish your entire Duke of Yue’s estate to death?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your Highness is obviously a royal prince. Yet, you think it’s wrong that these subjects are loyal to the emperor?" First Young Master Ning stared at Second Prince and laughed. "What type of reasoning is this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Second Prince angrily snarled, "I don’t want to waste effort talking rubbish with you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your Highness, you’re already a prisoner. If you don’t talk rubbish to pass time, what else can you do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You!" Second Prince was at a loss for words. Suddenly, he abruptly swore, "Ning Yu! You caused the death of the crown prince, and now you're going to kill your brothers. You fatuous ruler!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Stop making shit up!" Ning Xiaoluo was furious. </span><i><span style>His Majesty caused the death of the crown prince? How dare this man throw any crap he can at His Majesty’s head!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"You assume you can be the emperor if His Majesty is dead?" Ning Xiaomu lowered his voice and looked right at Second Prince.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Second Prince appeared to be both startled and enraged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You couldn’t go as far as believing that Xie Wenyuan would assist you to become the emperor," Ning Xiaomu said, "What would you gain from following Xie Wenyuan?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Xie Wenyuan is going to kill you," First Young Master Ning said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Second Prince was stunned. While he was in a daze, Ning Xiaomu stuffed a pill-like thing into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your Highness's life is of no use to His Majesty," said Ning Xiaomu, cruelly smiling at Second Prince. "On the contrary, your death can help His Majesty. Have a good trip*.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>*meaning to die at peace/rest well in heaven/be on your way</span></p>
