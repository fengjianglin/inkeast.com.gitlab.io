 <p>Chapter&nbsp;189: Lady Wang rams into the lantern stand&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally, Grand Preceptor Xie could draw the same conclusions as Lady Wang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The capital’s Xie Clan isn’t the only family surnamed ‘Xie’ in this world,” Grand Preceptor Xie placed the gold earrings on the armrest of his chair, his expression calm and unruffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“S-so shameless,” A’Mo said in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was shaken as well. </span><i><span style>He won’t admit responsibility no matter what? Is he the kind of guy who doesn’t cry even at the sight of his own coffin? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Hey, what’s the use of saying that stuff now?</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector approached Lou Zigui next and murmured, “We need to get to the bottom of this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui only looked at him. </span><i><span style>Just earlier, you were keeping your distance from the problem, but now you’ve suddenly decided to join in?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector said, “The Xie Clan’s eldest and third young Miss have already been betrothed, they’re just waiting for the mourning period to end before they marry into their new families. Do you know which families are taking them in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui now turned his head to see the Xie couple. Anyone who could marry the Xie Clan had to be part of a prominent clan themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the Wu and Lu families,” the Lord Protector continued. Ning Xiaoyao could hear the Lord Protector speaking, but she had no idea who the Wu or Lu families were. Lou Zigui’s hands clenched behind his back. Those two families were old prominent clans in the capital city; more importantly, each of them headed up soldiers around the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These two clans were probably grateful to Xie Wenyuan for giving them his granddaughters,” the Lord Protector said, holding back his laughter. “But for the Xie Clan daughters to have such morals despite hailing from a literary family really makes it seem like the Wu and Lu clans are swallowing a fly instead.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s more than just swallowing one fly. </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui thought. The Wu and Lu Clans weren’t aiming for the Xie Clan daughters specifically. With regards to Xie Wenyuan, they only had a normal business relationship and took his money. But they were perfectly capable of getting that money from other people instead.Whatever happened to the Xie Clan, it wasn’t their families who asked for marriage first. If the Xie Clan wanted to push their poisonous daughters into the Wu or Lu families, the results would be a feud instead of a wedding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did His Majesty plan all this out?” the Lord Protector asked Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>How could everything be so coincidental? Just when the general mourning period is ending and those two daughters are off to be married, something like this happens instead?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked at Ning Xiaoyao and believed she didn’t have the brains to scheme so extensively. Still, he couldn’t fathom it either. </span><i><span style>Was it all serendipity? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao only pouted. </span><i><span style>Am I the bad guy here? Why is Lord Protector staring at me like that? It’s lowering my impressions of him!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What other royal thoughts is Your Majesty considering?” Grand Preceptor Xie said after seeing that Ning Xiaoyao didn’t reply. He knew he’d put her in a bad spot, so he even feigned reverence towards the emperor as he spoke. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao couldn’t think up a good counter to Grand Preceptor Xie’s words. It really was true that other families surnamed </span><i><span style>Xie </span></i><span style>existed in the world. A’Mo said,” Xiaoyao, let’s just bite that bad guy to death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao ground her teeth. She really wanted to bite that old man to death, but seeing him swollen up all over made her realize she had no place to put her teeth. Grand Preceptor Xie didn’t even look human right now, so how was she supposed to chomp on him?! (</span><i><span style>Author: You mean you can bite him if he wasn’t all swelled up?!</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Find the justice court people to come,” Lou Zigui stepped forward. “This concerns matters of a human life, so we might as well leave the investigations to them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie looked coldly at Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>Have the local authorities investigate? No matter what conclusions they draw, inviting them to the inner courtyard will ruin all the girls of the Xie Clan, you swine. </span></i><span style>He was silently cursing Lou Zigui. Ning Xiaoyao had been staring at Grand Preceptor Xie the entire time and had noticed when his expression twisted. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She then told Lou Zigui, “Supreme Commander, the Grand Preceptor’s definitely cursing you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui drew his lips up into a cold smile. “Grand Preceptor, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie said, “These are this old man’s family matters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are they still </span><i><span style>just</span></i><span style> personal matters when they’ve nearly cost a human life?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “Don’t you keep fooling us with rhetoric, ah. You’re saying I’m falsely accusing your Xie Clan daughters, I’m convinced I’m not, so let the justice courts settle accounts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is this man, where did he come from, who did he talk to?” Lou Zigui asked, “How did he get into the Grand Preceptor’s estate and show up at Fifth Young Miss’ boudoir of all places? Where did the silver draft and bag of jewelry on his body come from? We’ll know the truth once we resolve all these questions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie didn’t even look at him. “Investigate where this man came from? Supreme Commander, do you think the Grand Preceptor’s estate is a place where just anyone can come and go freely?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, hmph,” Ning Xiaoyao expressed her disapproval a couple of times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor said, “Your Majesty is the sovereign of an entire nation. How could servants like us compare to the likes of you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui wore an icy grin. “The clothes he’s wearing don’t even fit him properly. The sleeves are too long, the waist too wide, and the pants too short. Grand Preceptor, does your estate employ such servants? Can they not even find clothes that fit them properly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd looked over and found Lou Zigui’s words to be true. None of the clothing quite fit on the man’s body, but how could a big family allow their servants to dress so shoddily?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What else do you have to say, Grand Preceptor?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. Grand Preceptor Xie only stared back. Ning Xiaoyao puffed up her best as she stood up straight. She wasn’t afraid of others staring when she’d done nothing wrong. With difficulty, Grand Preceptor Xie raised a hand. Just when he was about to rest it against his forehead, it dropped listlessly to his side again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” he said sorrowfully as he wore a smile. “If the sovereign wants his subject to die, the subject has no choice but to accept death. This subject begs Your Majesty to spare this subject’s granddaughters. This subject will bear the sole burden of their mistakes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao furrowed her brows. </span><i><span style>What does that mean? It sounds like the Grand Preceptor’s turning me into the bad guy here. </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui only chuckle and remarked, “If we go by the Grand Preceptor’s words, then it’s His Majesty’s fault that this mess happened at the Grand Preceptor’s estate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie only stared at Ning Xiaoyao, his swollen eyes glistening with teardrops. Ning Xiaoyao never expected the old geezer to counterattack at a time like this. But her befuddlement soon gave way to a rising anger. </span><i><span style>Isn’t he being completely unreasonable?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao prepared to blow her top when Lou Zigui took her hand and shook his head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be angry. Everything will clear up once we get someone to investigate, so there’s no way that we’ll lose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao took deep breaths and repeated silently to herself, </span><i><span style>This world has no zombies, this world has no zombies, this world has no zombies. </span></i><span style>Then she calmed down and told Grand Preceptor Xie, “I’m not such a disgusting person to pick on your family’s little girls. Neither of us can be the judge in this situation, so it’s better for the justice courts to investigate. I’ll send someone to keep an eye on them---you as well, Grand Preceptor. As long as we carefully look into the facts, we’ll find the truth eventually.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you bring up your family matters with me. For the sake of your family, your wife nearly took my Windy’s life.” Ning Xiaoyao cut him off. “In any case, it’s impossible for the facts to lie. We’ll have to investigate this even if we die. I refuse to believe that unsolvable mysteries exist in this world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui took the bag of jewelry from Ning Xiaoyao’s hands and added, “Ordinary families wouldn’t carve names into their jewelry. It’d be easy enough to track down the craftsman and shopkeepers and link them to the owner than way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I’ve falsely accused your Xie Clan’s young ladies, I’ll give them a personal apology,” Ning Xiaoyao added. “I’ll stand in the streets and say it, mark my words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A righteous figure fears no shadows,” Lou Zigui added. “If the Xie Clan daughters are innocent, they have no reason to fear any investigation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Once the local authorities get involved with inner court matters,” Lady Wang sobbed, “How will my Xie Clan daughters live on as proper, respectable ladies!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is your ladyship finally feeling regretful?” Lou Zigui asked coldly. “You led people to entrap Shadowgale and accused him of violating fifth young Miss. Why didn’t you remember they were your Xie Clan’s inner court matters then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Wang desperately wished she could re-do everything</span><i><span style>. I never would have held Shadowgale back if these were the consequences!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Ning Xiaoyao agreed. “Isn’t Windy’s reputation worth something just the same?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “Grand Preceptor, your ladyship, which is more important to you? Your Xie Clan daughters’ reputations, or His Majesty’s good name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exactly,” Ning Xiaoyao spoke up in favor of justice. “Windy is mine. If you guys curse him, it’s the same as slapping me in the face!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Windy is mine… </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui’s face turned black at the declaration. </span><i><span style>Why do those words sound so offensive to my ears?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale felt himself choke. </span><i><span style>His Majesty’s so protective of me even though I was protecting Xie Duoying back then. </span></i><span style>He almost felt like dying. </span><i><span style>Just what did I do, ah?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector enjoyed the entire show with great relish. Seeing His Majesty and Supreme Commander Lou take turns dressing down Grand Preceptor Xie and his wife felt like drinking sweet ice water on the hottest days of the year. He felt equals parts &nbsp;comfortable and at ease. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lady Wang saw Grand Preceptor Xie left speechless by the duo, she rose shakily to her feet and wiped away her tears. “Your Majesty, if it’s anyone who’s wrong, it’s this wife.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gave a start at her words. </span><i><span style>She’s admitting to her mistakes that easily? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui furrowed his brows before crying out urgently, “Stop her!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Lady Wang ran head-first into a stone lantern stand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhhhhh!” Screams of alarm rose in the courtyard. Lady Wang collapsed in a pool of blood, leaving a large scarlet stain against the lantern stand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crap! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was the first to reach the woman’s side. </span><i><span style>She actually resorted to suicide when she couldn’t beat me. Can people </span></i><b><i>please</i></b><i><span style> stop tossing their lives away like nothing here?! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie squeezed his eyes shut. With Lady Wang’s dying to prove her family’s innocence, his Xie Clan daughters would be innocent of all wrongdoing. Meanwhile, he could make sure to pin Ning Yu for the crime of forcing Lady Wang to suicide! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rested her hand against the gaping wound on Lady Wang’s forehead. She really had been looking to die and even cracked her skull against the stone lantern. The layer of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meninges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>meninx </span></a><span style>bordering her brain shifted slightly under Ning Xiaoyao’s touch. Lou Zigui walked to their side and murmured, “How is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because Ning Xiaoyao was wholly focused on repairing the damage, her complexion was a little pale. But she still managed to grin at him and answer, “How could anyone die with me around?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui creased his brows tightly at the sight of Ning Xiaoyao’s bloodstained hand. By now the Lord Protector had rushed over as well. </span><i><span style>Lady Wang can’t die. Otherwise, His Majesty’s crime of forcing his elders to die would far outshadow any transgressions by the Xie Clan daughters. </span></i><span style>Just the thought of it turned his scalp numb as he broke out into cold sweat. </span><i><span style>What now? </span></i><span style>He’d been doing nothing but watching a show just then, but now he was completely at a loss as to what to do.</span></p>
