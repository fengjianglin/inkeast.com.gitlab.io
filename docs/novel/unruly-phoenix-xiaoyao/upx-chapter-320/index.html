 <p>Chapter 320: I'm unlucky, you deserve it</p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gestured to Empress Dowager Xie. “Fine, you're older, you start.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re really going to kick me out of the palace?” asked Empress Dowager Xie.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can I speak now?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak!” Empress Dowager Xie shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh. Yes, ah.” Ning Xiaoyao nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Dowager is your biological mother!” Empress Dowager shrieked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao waved her hand. “How many times do I have to tell you? I’m done with all these sentimental talks. Yes, it’s true that you’re my biological mother. But you want me dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Dowager does not.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not now, because Ning Xin is still young. If I die, you would be done for.” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “But what happens when Ning Xin grows up? Do you take me for a fool? Actually, can we skip this topic? Aren’t you sick of going back to this talk again and again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie shook her head. “You cannot treat this Dowager like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is not simply my decision.” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “This is the imperial court’s decision.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Imperial court?” Empress Dowager Xie’s unkempt brows lifted in surprise. “Who? Who wants to exterminate this Dowager?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does not allowing you to stay at the Empress Dowager Palace equates to exterminating you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it Lou Zigui?” Empress Dowager Xie chided.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You think Lou Zigui can be bothered with you?” Ning Xiaoyao puffed out her chest. “Old Gramps is the one who said it. He thinks if you still have any shame left, you should leave the palace on your own accord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Did Elder Li say that? o(╯□╰)o</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie was well aware who this Old Gramps was. She started cursing him on the spot. “Li Wuqi, you old commoner!” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop berating others.” Ning Xiaoyao was instantly dissatisfied. “Do you think you’re a good person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager looked at Ning Xiaoyao and let out a cold sneer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don't have to leave if you don't want to.” Ning Xiaoyao commented. “In any case, I've already dismissed everyone in this palace. You can stay here with your son all you want, but you will have to fend for your own necessities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you wish death upon this Dowager?” Empress Dowager asked Ning Xiaoyao, her voice trembling.</span><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was fed up on the inside. </span><i><span style>Again with this crap. What makes Empress Dowager think she deserves to live a long life in her heart? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I was on your side during Xie Wenyuan’s rebellion.” Empress Dowager trembled as she looked at Ning Xiaoyao. “Now that you no longer have use of me, you want to kick this Dowager out of the palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It's just switching a location…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Dowager is the empress dowager!” Empress Dowager screeched, interrupting Ning Xiaoyao. “Throughout the entire Yongning Dynasty, there has never been an empress dowager who didn’t spend her old age at the Empress Dowager Palace!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bullshit.” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Listen to yourself speak. Throughout the Yongning Dynasty, how many concubines have </span><i><span style>lied</span></i><span style> to an emperor saying that they have given birth to a son instead of a daughter? Do you even have any shame?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie was choked up by Ning Xiaoyao’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll only say this once. Empress Dowager, listen up ya.” Ning Xiaoyao looked at Empress Dowager and enunciated word by word. “I do not like to kill, but I can kill, so do not make me kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still pressing the dagger by her throat, Empress Dowager Xie took a few steps back after hearing Ning Xiaoyao’s words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no sentiments between us. If you want to die, I won't stop you, and I will definitely not save you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tears rolled down Empress Dowager Xie’s cheeks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you regret your past actions now?” Ning Xiaoyao asked coldly. “What should you have done?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie loosened her grip, and “Kwang!” the dagger fell to the ground. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With her arms crossed, Ning Xiaoyao stared at Empress Dowager Xie. She already knew this woman couldn’t bear to part with life. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have to coerce me this far?” Empress Dowager stammered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right. I am coercing you. So what? Enough with your pitiful act. Everyone is gone and there’s no audience. So who are you still acting for?” Ning Xiaoyao nonchalantly replied.&nbsp;</span><span style>The door to the palace chamber was still wide open, yet Ning Yu dared to speak so openly about a princess acting as a substitute for the emperor’s son. Empress Dowager concluded there must be no one else in the palace. Upon knowing this, she fell into despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao swept her eyes at Ning Xin, who was sleeping soundly on the cushion. </span><i><span style>This baby sure has a good life. Two adults are at each other’s throat, yet all he does is eat and sleep. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager lowered her head and had an internal battle for a while. All of a sudden, she fell on her knees, and knelt before Ning Xiaoyao.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was so shocked that she yelped, “What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie continued kneeling on the floor. She lifted her head up to look at Ning Xiaoyao. “Your Majesty, please let this Dowager off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn't understand. “I don’t starve or freeze you. Neither do I hit or yell at you. I’m just telling you to change another location. Why are you acting as if I’m trying to kill you or something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After leaving the palace, is this Dowager still Empress Dowager?” Empress Dowager Xie had tears streaming down her face. “This Dowager knows what you're trying to do. First, you will kick this Dowager out of the palace. Then, when Xie Wenyuan cause trouble again, you will abolish this Dowager’s title. Xie Wenyuan definitely will cause trouble again. So, you want to get rid of this Dowager. Your Majesty, I know I have done you wrong, but I worked very hard to get you the emperor’s seat. You musn't, you mustn't do this to this Dowager!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her chin.</span><i><span style> Could Old Gramps not only want to prevent the crown prince from seeing Empress Dowager Xie, but also wants to abolish the empress dowager from her position?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, ah!” Empress Dowager attempted to embrace Ning Xiaoyao’s legs</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stepped aside to avoid her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Dowager cannot leave the palace!” she cried. </span><i><span style>She cannot get kicked out of the palace. She is still the empress dowager so long as she is still in her palace. She is the empress dowager of the current dynasty. Today, she will let the world know that she’s ashamed of her lineage, but how should she explain to the world when Xie Wenyuan makes another move? Apart from relinquishing her honored status, what other plan does she have to redeem herself? Even when that time comes and she were to remain quiet, Ning Yu will do it for her. Even if Ning Yu were to poisoned her to death, the whole world will feel that she took her own life out of shame.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She went from refusing to back down, to not wanting to die. Empress Dowager Xie felt that her life was rather pathetic. She had lived impressively for half of her lifetime, but towards the end, she realised that her hands were empty. She even had to deal with her enemy’s attitude in order to survive. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever.” Ning Xiaoyao was out of patience and turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!” Empress Dowager Xie slammed her forehead against the ground, pleading. “This Dowager is begging you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao halted her steps and turned to look at Empress Dowager Xie.&nbsp;</span><span style>Empress Dowager Xie looked so pathetic, but at least she wasn’t unattractive. She was like raindrops on a pear blossom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn..” Ning Xiaoyao laughed and walked a few steps before squatting down in front of Empress Dowager Xie. “So, it turns out you also know how to beg others?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie looked at Ning Xiaoyao with a face filled with tears. “Your Majesty, no matter what this Dowager does, I am still your…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don't say the word biological mother.” Ning Xiaoyao exclaimed. “I’ve asked around. Back then I’m sure the previous empress had also knelt before you. She begged you to spare the crown prince’s youngest son.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie’s crying stopped.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pointing to her own forehead, Ning Xiaoyao spoke again. “You told the previous empress, so long you see blood here, you might be filled with kindness and change your mind. So, the empress pounded her forehead until it bled. Yet, in the end, you killed all her children. How did she curse you back then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Empress Dowager Xie felt cold and trembled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ning Xiaoyao lowered her voice and icily replied, “You expect me to go easy on you when you are so cruel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Had the crown prince not die, you wouldn’t have been the emperor!” Empress Dowager Xie countered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who friggin wants to be an emperor?” Ning Xiaoyao roared at Empress Dowager Xie. “</span><i><span style>You’re</span></i><span style> the one who wants me to be the emperor! What you want is to hold the imperial court from behind the screen. YOU want to be the female emperor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unable to speak, Empress Dowager Xie’s lips quivered before letting out an audible cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many people died because of you? You’re arrogant when inflicting harm upon others. Have you ever thought this would happen to you? You think </span><i><span style>I</span></i><span style> should let you off because you’re on your knees begging? Did </span><i><span style>you</span></i><span style> let anyone off?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie’s body turned limp as she lost balance and fell to the ground, sitting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sneered and let off a cold snort. She stood up to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I gave birth to you.” Empress Dowager Xie softly whispered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I admit I’m unlucky. You should admit you deserve it. I'm not going to put up with you because I hate you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you are trying to kill me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m waiting for you to perish with me. Didn't the empress already tell you? She will be waiting for you in hell. Go stay in a monastery. Although I'm not sure if it can help you, you should chant lots of Buddhist scriptures. You have committed too many sins, I'm afraid you won't attain peace even when you're dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager shook her head as if she was possessed. “You cannot do this to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned around and left. </span><i><span style>It's another one of those days where they made no conversational progress.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If I hadn’t fought for it, what do you think would’ve happened to us?” Seeing that Ning Xiaoyao was really leaving, Empress Dowager Xie suddenly stood up and screamed. “How do you know that the empress wouldn’t have harmed us?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ai ma. I’m about to explode. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao took a deep breath and turned around to shriek. “She was already </span><i><span style>Empress</span></i><span style>! Do you think she would bother about you, the</span><i><span style> mistress </span></i><span style>of a previous emperor? She was</span><i><span style> an empress</span></i><span style>, her husband was </span><i><span style>the emperor</span></i><span style>. Why would you matter?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager shook her head profusely. “You don't understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't. How could I understand the poisonous thoughts of a person like you? You’re like a poisonous snake.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned around and hurriedly left. The more she said, the more fired up she was. She was afraid if she continued chatting with Empress Dowager Xie, she might lose control and beat her up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale was waiting at the front courtyard of the palace with a group of Dragon Guards. When he saw Ning Xiaoyao storming out, Shadowgale ran to Ning Xiaoyao. “What's the matter, Your Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you removed everyone from the palace?” Ning Xiaoyao asked</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.” Shadowgale replied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good. Seal the door, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale looked behind Ning Xiaoyao and didn't see Empress Dowager Xie appearing.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Empress Dowager Palace had a door at the front and at the back. There was also a side gate to the left of the palace for people to enter and exit. Several Dragon Guards took wooden planks and nailed these three doors shut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale pushed the nailed backdoor to check it was secure before he turned to the Dragon Guards. “You guys will remain here to guard this place. No matter what Empress Dowager says, ignore her. The only exception is if she says she’s willing to leave and head to the Buddhist monastery.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guards understood and responded in unison.&nbsp;</span><span style>“No one is allowed to send in any food or water.” Shadowgale added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guards acknowledged the order once more. Earlier, they had already removed all the food and drinks from the palace. How long can Empress Dowager last with her tender and delicate figure?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After briefing his men, Shadowgale was about to leave when they heard Empress Dowager screaming from behind the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty! This Dowager wishes to see His Majesty!” Empress Dowager Xie shrieked.&nbsp;</span><span style>Shadowgale sneered and headed to the direction of Supreme Splendor Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie held Ning Xin in her arms. She stood with dishevelled hair by the door. She screamed until her voice turned hoarse, yet no one responded to her. Empress Dowager attempted to shake and push the door open. But the thick and heavy door didn’t budge at all. Then, she tried to use her body to slam against it. The door moved slightly, but remained shut. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guards stood outside the door in silence. Their expressions were serene; it was as if no one heard anything.</span></p>
