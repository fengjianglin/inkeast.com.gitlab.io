 <p><span style>Qin Xuan’s first reaction was to flare up at Ning Xiaoyao’s question. </span><i><span style>Can’t you think of something more positive about my elder sister? </span></i><span style>But his heart soon gave way to warmth. If His Majesty didn’t genuinely care about them, why would he run out here personally?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao waved her hand in front of Qin Xuan’s face. “Are you so sad that you’ve lost your wits?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan said, “Your Majesty, this subject’s elder sister is fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then is there something wrong with you?” Ning Xiaoyao looked at Qin Xuan from head to foot before resting her hand on his shoulder. “Huh? You’re perfectly fine,” Ning Xiaoyao stated. “Did you guys forget something here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, let this subject speak,” Qin Xuan said. </span><i><span style>Why is he so eager to see us run into trouble?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stared at Qin Xuan, who said, “This subject discovered troops and horses outside the city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Troops and horses?” Ning Xiaoyao exhaled. “My God, I thought that something serious had happened. Troops and horses are just troops and horses, they have nothing to do with me. Heheh, all the troops and horses in the city listen to the Grand Preceptor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...........” said Qin Xuan. He suddenly discovered that His Majesty really had an extremely generous heart!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, I know now,” Ning Xiaoyao waved a hand at Qin Xuan. “Goodbye, General Qin.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What do you mean, you know now? </span></i><span style>Qin Xuan stamped his foot in his worry. “Your Majesty, this subject wants to enter the palace and discuss details with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Details on the troops and horses?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Qin Xuan’s face was all persistence. At the very least, he could tell Lou Zigui everything if he entered the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then alright,” Ning Xiaoyao brought Qin Xuan into the palace with her. “Let’s sit down and have a talk.” It was nothing but a single company of troops and horses. Plenty of them filled the streets of the capital, so what was so strange about that? (</span><i><span style>Author: When have you ever seen troops and horses filling the streets of the capital? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, the seven astrologers had appeared at the entrance. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph!” Ning Xiaoyao humphed at them before holding up her head, throwing out her chest, and striding right past them. The seven astrologers were rendered speechless. </span><i><span style>Does he have a grudge against us now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan glanced at the court robes of the seven men before he asked, “These are officials from the astronomy department?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao answered. “Seven fortune tellers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said Qin Xuan and the seven astrologers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, Lou Zigui had arrived with quick steps from the Supreme Splendor Hall. When he saw that Qin Xuan was unharmed, his minutely furrowed eyebrows didn’t relax. There was no sign of tears on the other man’s face, which meant that Qin Xin had to be alright. So what had made Qin Xuan return?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Qin Xuan saw Lou Zigui, he wanted to speak up, but Lou Zigui silenced him with a wave. “Let’s go in to talk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seven astrologers glanced at Lou Zigui and couldn’t help but feel like the Supreme Splendor Hall was </span><i><span style>his </span></i><span style>home instead. Lou Zigui glanced at the group and asked, “Do you seven still have business here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seven astrologers hastily resumed their trek towards the palace gates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remember to bring cooking pot lids on the day of the ceremony!” Ning Xiaoyao shouted after the astrologers, who began to jog away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cooking pot lids?” Lou Zigui echoed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They don’t know how to fight, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao said. Lou Zigui understood. Since those astrologers couldn’t fight, they’d need something to defend themselves when a fight broke out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Armor exists,” he said as he rested his hand against his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Armor?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “I don’t know whether they have armor at home or not. I can only be sure that they’ll definitely have cooking pot lids.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Makes sense,” Qin Xuan nodded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>What was Supreme Commander Lou to say against such logical words? He sighed and said, “As long as Your Majesty’s happy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not happy,” Ning Xiaoyao pouted. They were going to fight both politically and physically soon, so how could she be pleased? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did something happen?” Qin Xuan asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao lowered her voice. “Something big.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“..........” said Qin Xuan. </span><i><span style>Why is this subject not getting that vibe from you at all?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Soon enough, the three of them retreated to a wing in Supreme Splendor Hall, where Qin Xuan explained the troops and horses he’d seen disguised as a merchant party outside the capital, along with their southern accents. Ning Xiaoyao was still clueless as to what was going on, but Lou Zigui’s eyes were gloomy as he sat in his seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many of them were there?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About 100 people,” Qin Xuan replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is 100 people really serious?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. 100 humans wasn’t much to her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui dropped his voice. “Of course 100 people isn’t enough to constitute a threat. The trouble comes if they’ve split up the entire force into sections.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it the Grand Preceptor?” Qin Xuan asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui smiled coldly. “No one </span><i><span style>but </span></i><span style>the Grand Preceptor has the skills to bring troops and horses from the south into the capital city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is he planning to do?” Qin Xuan asked hastily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps we’ll resort to arms at the Grand Sacrificial Ceremony in two days,” Lou Zigui told Qin Xuan, before adding, “Hurry and take Miss Qin away from here, the farther away the better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?!” Qin Xuan sprang to his feet. </span><i><span style>Resorting to arms on the day of the Grand Sacrificial Ceremony?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor wants to kill me, oh,” Ning Xiaoyao chuckled. “Of course, I want to kill him off too.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So you decided to make your move on the day of the Grand Sacrificial Ceremony? </span></i><span style>Regional Commander Qin was astonished. </span><i><span style>But that’s the Grand Sacrificial Ceremony! Are you going to ignore all the gods, Buddhas, and Ning ancestors present in the Heavens?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave as quick as you can,” Lou Zigui urged Qin Xuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, then since Xie Wenyuan’s already moved his troops into the capital, have you done the same with your men, Supreme Commander?” Qin Xuan asked. Judging by the dates, it was impossible for the rest of the Black Frost Cavalry to reach the capital so soon. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui grinned. “Regional Commander, you don’t need to worry. I can promise that His Majesty will be unharmed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao flexed her arm to show Qin Xuan her muscles, only to find that you couldn’t see any muscles on her arm at all.</span><span style>&nbsp;Qin Xuan asked Ning Xiaoyao, “Your Majesty, what can this subject do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go to Jiangnan and live well with Miss Qin,” Ning Xiaoyao said without thinking. “And have some kids with her too. You can do that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan grew anxious. “Your Majesty, this subject is worried about you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao ran in front of him and split her lips in a grin. “General Qin, thank you for coming back to tell me about the southern soldiers. Aren’t you afraid that something will happen to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan’s countenance turned stern. “Your Majesty, this subject wouldn’t even hesitate to scale a mountain of swords and plunge into a sea of flames for your sake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was moved. She lowered her head and prepared to hug Qin Xuan, but Lou Zigui stepped forward and dragged her back by the collar. Qin Xuan gave a start as he looked at them, not knowing what was the matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You two should make haste and depart. Don’t let the Grand Preceptor stop you,” Lou Zigui said after pulling Ning Xiaoyao behind him. “That would be the biggest help to us. You have to be careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan nodded. He didn’t have many men with him, so even if he did stay, they could only act as a few extra fighters, too insignificant to affect the whole. He stood up and fell to his knees to give Ning Xiaoyao a grand bow. “Your Majesty, you must take care. Even if this subject and my elder sister falls into Xie Wenyuan’s hands, you mustn’t attend to us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was about to speak when Lou Zigui squeezed her hand to hold her back. Qin Xuan bid his farewell as soon as he rose to his feet, and left. When Lou Zigui was sending him off, he murmured, “Xie Wenyuan’s completely focused on the Grand Sacrificial Ceremony right now. As long as you two are careful, you won’t fall into danger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“May Regional Commander do your best regarding the silver mines as well,” Lou Zigui added. “As for the Xie Clan’s businesses, His Majesty will send a few men to find you in Jiangnan soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui had already mentioned these things to Qin Xuan before, so repeating them now deepened the impression in his mind. “I understand. Supreme Commander needn’t worry. I, Qin Xuan, am not a man who forgets my debts of gratitude.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stopped by the door and cupped his hands before his chest. “Smooth journeys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan hurried out of the palace before getting on his horse and whipping it into a gallop out of the southern city gates. Ning Xiaoyao held onto the doorframe as she watched him leave. She was about to turn and speak to Lou Zigui when she heard a sparrow chirping by the window. Her head swiveled until she saw Grandfather Sparrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That there,” Ning Xiaoyao told Lou Zigui, “Supreme Commander, go talk about the ceremony with Windy and the rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui grabbed onto Ning Xiaoyao before she could run off. “What are you off to now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes spun before she replied, “I want to go take a nap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandfather Sparrow covered his face with his wings. </span><i><span style>Of all the excuses…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s mouth twitched. </span><i><span style>She’s still in the mood to nap at a time like this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t sleep all last night,” Ning Xiaoyao pretended to yawn a few times. Actually, she was perfectly capable of fighting zombies even without sleeping for three days, but if she had to feign weakness now, so be it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on,” Lou Zigui softened when he saw her yawning. His fingers brushed against her face before privately musing that she’d gotten thinner. At his words, Ning Xiaoyao flipped out the window and dashed off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, come in,” Lou Zigui settled himself into an empty chair in the wing as he called to Shadowgale and the rest, who were waiting outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao ran all the way to the flower gardens outside her bedroom before coming to stand beneath the Wutong tree. She asked Grandfather Sparrow, “How is it? Any news of Supreme Commander’s big brother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black scampered out from the bushes and zipped up to Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulders. Grandfather Sparrow replied, “The flock of geese I found weren’t from beyond the pass.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Meow,” Big Boss Black was disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, Xiaoyao,” Grandfather Sparrow continued, “I said you’d thank them plenty, so the flock outside the city’s agreed to help us scope out information.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great, great,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded quickly. “I could give them mountains of gold and silver if they wanted, as long as they can tell me about Supreme Commander’s big brother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandfather Sparrow grew silent before he said, “Xiaoyao, all you have to do is give them some fish and shrimp.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s it?” Ning Xiaoyao broke into a smile instantly. “That’s fine, ah. No problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still owe Big Boss Black five fish,” Grandfather Sparrow reminded Ning Xiaoyao. “But you can’t owe the geese any fish or shrimp, </span><i><span style>cheep!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...........” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Was there no animal who didn’t know I owe Black Tubby five fish?</span></i><span style> Big Boss Black scratched her with his claws. As soon as he remembered those fish, he’d get angry!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough already, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “If you scratch me again, I’ll fight back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black scratched her again, so Ning Xiaoyao picked him up by the scruff of his neck and flung him into the Wutong tree. Big Boss Black perched on its branches and shouted, “If you can’t bear to part with the fish and shrimp, the geese flock won’t tell us about Supreme Commander’s big brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As if I need you to tell me that!” Ning Xiaoyao spat at the ground. What kind of impression did that Black Tubby have of her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, right,” Grandfather Sparrow said. “I heard my grandchild at the justice courts mention that that little née Wang had a miscarriage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” said Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She got into an argument with Xie Anshi and he shoved her to the ground. Then she lost her baby,” Big Boss Black said as he licked his fur. “And here this cat thought that Xie Anshi actually liked that little white flower.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head. How could such an irresponsible, dishonest man love anyone else? That was just talking nonsense.</span></p>
