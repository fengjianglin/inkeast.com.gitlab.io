 <p>Chapter&nbsp;123: When His Majesty meets with swindlers<span class="hidden-text">&nbsp;Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Qin Xuan was standing by the road outside the southern gates of the capital. He glanced at Qin Xin perched by the carriage’s window and said, “We’ve left the capital city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xin didn’t turn back to reply him, her thoughts on that city were that it had been her cage. She only said in a small voice, “Take me away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan nodded slightly. He wanted to smile, but he suddenly felt too stifled to do it successfully. Qin Xin smiled instead. She had always felt like everything was a dream, but now that she was out of the city, she was sure that she’d be able to go home again. When Qin Xuan saw her smile then, he believed that His Majesty’s words were right. His sister’s smile was truly peerlessly elegant and full of intellectual brilliance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Qin Xuan patted the carriage window before he said loudly, “We’re going home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The leader of the bodyguards raised his voice. “Alright, hyaa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group continued their journey on the road. About an hour later, a company of ordinary citizens dressed in merchants’ clothing passed by Qin Xuan’s group. After they left, Qin Xuan halted his horse, causing Qin Xin to lift the curtains and look outside to see why.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those were soldiers,” Qin Xuan murmured as he watched the retreating merchant party. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xin quickly looked back. As a daughter of a military family, she could tell the merchants were military men just by looking at their gait. “How could that be?” she asked in alarm. “Why would there be soldiers in commoner clothing moving about outside the capital?” Within the city, soldiers were soldiers and civilians were civilians. </span><i><span style>What were those soldiers thinking by disguising themselves as the latter?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from Qin Xuan and Qin Xin, their bodyguards had grown anxious as well. “They had a southern accent,” one of the bodyguards said as he approached Qin Xuan. “Regional Commander, I heard them talk as they passed by. They have southern accents, but I’m not sure which specific region they’re from.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So they aren’t soldiers from the capital city?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan and Qin Xin exchanged glances before the former grit his teeth. “Big sis, I’ll get Little Lu and the rest to escort you to the courier station ahead. I’m going to take a trip back to the capital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xin knew it’d be dangerous for Qin Xuan to go back alone, but she nodded her head all the same. “You have to be careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are people from our Qin Clan stationed at the courier post up ahead, so you don’t need to fear big sis,” Qin Xuan patted Qin Xin’s hand, which was resting against the carriage window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not afraid. I’ll wait for you at the courier station. Nothing can happen to His Majesty,” Qin Xin said softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan only brought a single guard with him as he rushed back towards the capital. Qin Xin slowly sat back in the carriage. Good people should meet with good ends. If Heaven had eyes, it would protect her brother and His Majesty so that both would be unharmed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the palace, Ning Xiaoyao and the astrologers had ended up at odds with each other. Their conversation was like a donkey trying to talk to a horse, completely incompatible. Finally, both His Majesty Ning and those so-called swindlers ended up feeling extremely stifled. Both parties thought the other side was completely abnormal.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I have to abstain from meat and wine and take a bath just to burn some incense? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao ridiculed in her heart. </span><i><span style>And I can’t even eat! Isn’t this just a form of punishment? What’s it all for? Dead people don’t need to eat, so the living have to keep them company?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why doesn’t His Majesty understand a thing? </span></i><span style>The so-called swindling astrologers ridiculed in their hearts. </span><i><span style>He’s not only ignorant, but impossible to understand. What’s going on here? Did the Grand Preceptor only raise His Majesty’s body instead of his brain? Doesn’t he even know how to use human speech?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Both the sitting party and standing parties were staring at each other before they each quickly averted their eyes, unable to bear the sight any longer. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you guys afraid that I, Your Majesty, will starve to death?” Ning Xiaoyao still couldn’t accept it after thinking it over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seven so-called swindlers stood there, all wooden-faced. They’d never heard of someone dying due to fasting a single day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Are you guys trying the silent treatment against me? Look at me, hey! I’m the emperor--the </span><i><span style>emperor, </span></i><span style>don’t you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The head astrologer opened his mouth with effort. “Your Majesty chides aptly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean, I chide aptly?” Ning Xiaoyao said. “I’m the emperor, so I can do whatever I want. Do you know why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seven so-called swindlers remained staring at Ning Xiaoyao still wearing their wooden expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao raised her voice for a rousing speech, “Because I’m the emperor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How they wanted to die and bring His Majesty with them! The seven so-called swindlers all shared the same thought at this exact moment. (o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale and a few other Dragon Guards had been acting as wallflowers the entire time. When he saw His Majesty about to lose it against the astrologers, Shadowgale felt extremely stifled. </span><i><span style>If His Majesty beats them up until they’re bedridden, how will we take care of the Grand Sacrificial Ceremony in two days’ time? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Is that the only thing you’re worried about…</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And also, what if someone tries to hurt me in the Grand Sacrificial Hall that day?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The head astrologer replied, “Your Majesty jests. What kind of scoundrel would have the gall to harm Your Majesty in the Grand Sacrificial Hall?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor, for example. My God,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “Just then, you cursed him as a scoundrel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The head astrologer wanted to go home. </span><i><span style>If I stay here any longer, I’ll go insane. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of expression are you making?” Ning Xiaoyao asked him with a constipated look herself. </span><i><span style>Doesn’t he know I’m the emperor here?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The head astrologer lowered his head. “Your Majesty, these traditions were passed down from the ancestors.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “I was talking about the Grand Preceptor, but now you’re bringing up ancestral traditions. Your Excellency, ah, why is it so tiring to talk to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said the seven astrologers. They were tired and confused, too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “I’ll switch up my words, use some common terms that you can all understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The head astrologer replied, “May Your Majesty instruct us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just earlier, you said you seven would keep an eye on me the entire time,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “So how are your martial arts skills?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The head astrologer replied, “Your Majesty, we subjects are part of the astronomy department.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know that. So what?” Ning Xiaoyao said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are civil officials, not military men,” the head astrologer explained bluntly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Then what do I need you seven for? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” the head astrologer continued, “When offering sacrifices to Heaven and one’s ancestors, we must abstain from weapons or war. This is…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough, you.” Ning Xiaoyao cut him off. “You guys insist on coming that day?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” the head astrologer answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then fine,” Ning Xiaoyao said helplessly. “Remember to carry a cooking pot lid on your backs that day.” </span><i><span style>When a fight breaks out, the lids will shield them so they don’t lose their lives needlessly.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The seven astrologers had to keep up a mental chant in their heads. </span><i><span style>Injuring the sovereign is a capital offense, regicide is a capital offense, we mustn’t be disrespectful to His Majesty, or else our entire families will be executed…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not going to talk with you guys anymore,” Ning Xiaoyao dug her nails into her palms. “Can you guys leave now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We subjects shall take our leave,” the seven astrologers chorused before withdrawing. They didn’t want to talk to a jerk like His Majesty any longer, either! And thus, the meeting between His Majesty and the astrologers came to an unhappy conclusion. When Lou Zigui returned to see the wing still in one piece, with bright windows and clean tables, he silently exhaled in relief. </span><i><span style>It was good that nothing had happened.</span></i><span style> Shadowgale and the rest all noticed Lou Zigui’s actions. A few of the Dragon Guard took on complicated looks. Certainly, His Majesty hadn’t fought with anyone this time, but he’d abused them plenty. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “Is that young Ning alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He slipped into a crowd of refugees headed for the southwest,” Lou Zigui replied. “As long as everything goes well, he should reach Fengzhou safely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, then I’ll stop worrying about him,” Ning Xiaoyao waved a hand before speaking to Shadowgale. “Windy, call everyone over. We’re going to have a meeting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale ran off to call the other Dragon Guards for a meeting. Lou Zigui waved a hand to dismiss Shadowrain and his men before walking to Ning Xiaoyao’s side. “What is it?” he asked her quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Sacrificial Hall, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “I suspect the Grand Preceptor will make his move that day to replace me with my doppelganger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui immediately grew alert and mentally reviewed the rites and rituals of the ceremony. “Then he’ll take advantage of the time when Your Majesty is alone in the ancestral hall to make his move?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao snapped her fingers. “Bingo, you’re right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rested a hand against his forehead. </span><i><span style>What in the world is ‘bingo?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“We have a place and time,” Ning Xiaoyao counted off with her fingers. “But we don’t know the method. How are they going to bring in the doppelganger? If nobody’s allowed to enter the ancestral hall, then how are they planning to kill me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t speak nonsense,” Lou Zigui raised a hand to cover Ning Xiaoyao’s mouth when she started talking about dying. Ning Xiaoyao puffed up her cheeks in protest. </span><i><span style>Since when did I say any nonsense?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui paced back and forth in front of Ning Xiaoyao a few times before he said, “If he’s planning to make a move at the ancestral hall, that means he has his people planted there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then suppose we capture all the people stationed at the ancestral hall?” Ning Xiaoyao suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if we do, Xiaoyao, you’ll still need to replace them with other men,” Lou Zigui said. “How can you be sure that none of the replacements are questionable as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought it over. “Then what if we sent Windy and Little Fang in their place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui shook his head. “Weapons and war are forbidden when making offerings to Heaven and one’s ancestors. They’re all military men, so they won’t be allowed to enter the hall.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How come you’re saying those things too?” Ning Xiaoyao cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui smiled before he sneered. “Military men carry the aura of blood on their bodies. They’ll offend the spirits and late emperors with their presence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nonsense,” Ning Xiaoyao spat out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now isn’t the time for things like that,” Lou Zigui stroked Ning Xiaoyao’s drooping head. “Let’s talk about the Grand Sacrificial Ceremony first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, one of the guards by the door ran inside and announced, “Your Majesty, Qin Xuan begs for an audience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Ning Xiaoyao jumped out of her seat. </span><i><span style>Why is he coming back again right after he left? Did they suffer at the hands of the Grand Preceptor’s men? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t panic,” Lou Zigui pushed Ning Xiaoyao back into her seat and murmured, “Let Qin Xuan in.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could Qin Xuan run any faster than me? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought, before springing back up to her feet again. If something really had happened, she could still run out of the palace and save them. </span><i><span style>What if Qin Xin had gotten injured again? </span></i><span style>She could heal her if she had to. “Supreme Commander, wait here for me. I’ll be right back.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn’t give Lou Zigui another chance to stop her, but sped out of the room. By the time Lou Zigui had chased her outside, she had already vanished from sight. Meanwhile, the seven astrologers were still on their way out of the palace. They were currently fretting over the fact that they had such an unpleasant emperor to deal with for the ceremony in two days when a burst of wind rushed past them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The head astrologer stopped and said uncertainly, “Was that, was that His Majesty?” He couldn’t see the figure clearly, but it was dressed in those familiar bright robes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It </span><i><span style>is </span></i><span style>His Majesty,” the head astrologer said again. All of the seven astrologers fell silent. They couldn’t win against the emperor in words, fights, or rules. At this moment, they keenly understand the same suffering that Grand Preceptor Xie had experienced. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao ran frantically out of the palace in one long breath. She hadn’t even faced Qin Xuan yet before she was tugging at his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it, ah? Did something happen to Miss Qin?!”</span></p>
