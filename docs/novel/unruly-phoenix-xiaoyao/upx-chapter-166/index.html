 <p>Chapter&nbsp;166:&nbsp;If the Grand Preceptor can wreck it, then I can fix it&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector called out to his younger brother, “Why aren’t you kneeling and paying respects to His Majesty yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Come in and talk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan strode into the main hall. Ning Xiaoyao examined the second young master of the Pei Clan, who had exceptionally pale skin and fine, exquisite features.</span><i><span style> He didn’t look very manly. </span></i><span style>Pei Yan glanced at Ning Xiaoyao, then at Lou Zigui, before he laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have heard that Your Majesty is fighting with the Grand Preceptor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao replied easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor holds all military power in his hands, so Your Majesty probably can’t do anything against him, right?” Pei Yan added.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Slap. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt like she’d just been slapped soundly on the face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty went down on your knees to make an apology today,” Pei Yan added, “Because you have no men at your disposal, and want to use our Pei Clan, right?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Slap, slap!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt another invisible smack on her face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let this commoner have a guess,” Pei Yan went on. “Tao Chen, the Nine Gates Infantry Commander, is dead. But Xie Wenyuan still controls the forces under his command. Your Majesty needed one of Xie Wenyuan’s enemies to take the post, so you were planning to aim for my elder brother? Otherwise, would Your Majesty even remember the existence of our Lord Protector’s estate?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Slapslapslap---!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao could almost feel her face swelling up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be quiet!” the old matriarch shouted at her youngest son.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan lowered his head, but a sardonic smile was still playing about his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” the old matriarch attempted to explain. “That boy is this old woman’s second son. He’s surnamed Pei, named Yan, and he’s always been immature. This old woman has doted on him too much and spoiled him rotten. If he has caused you any disrespect, I asked that Your Majesty mete punishment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mother,” Second Young Master Pei Yan lifted his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still not shutting up?” the Lord Protector stepped in this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It looks like the second young master is both self-assured and fearless,” Lou Zigui remarked. “His Majesty is in dire want of loyal, capable men under his command. But isn’t that the case with the Lord Protector’s estate as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Lou Zigui’s words, Pei Yan’s smile vanished, and he turned gloomy instead. Lou Zigui never wanted to make enemies of the Lord Protector’s estate, but he couldn’t help his temper after seeing Pei Yan’s deliberately enigmatic attitude towards Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Does he really think His Majesty came to beg for their help?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not bad,” Ning Xiaoyao stuck up her thumb at Pei Yan. “You deserve a </span><i><span style>‘like’ </span></i><span style>for face slapping someone as soon as you felt unsatisfied. I’ll respect you as a real man. Come, have a seat,” Ning Xiaoyao pointed at an empty chair in the hall. “Let’s talk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said the Pei Clan. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did His Majesty misunderstand Pei Yan’s words, or are we the ones with hearing problems today?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Everyone should find a seat. Let’s chat while sitting down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan only waited until the old matriarch sat down before he found his own chair---but not the one that Ning Xiaoyao had pointed at. Originally, Ning Xiaoyao was sitting in the main seat of honor in the hall, but after seeing Pei Yan sit somewhere else, she ran to sit next to him instead. Pei Yan neither moved nor otherwise acknowledge her existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “You used the right tactic. </span><i><span style>‘If the enemy won’t budge, then I won’t budge either.’ </span></i><span style>I’ll give you another </span><i><span style>‘like.’”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan was beginning to wonder whether His Majesty had mental problems. </span><i><span style>Just what is he talking about?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know how to fight?” Ning Xiaoyao asked next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lou Zigui heard Ning Xiaoyao’s question, he had a sudden inkling of what she was thinking. “Your Majesty,” he said as he hurried to her side. </span><i><span style>Forget about whether Pei Yan can fight or not, how is someone with an imperfect body supposed to be the next Nine Gates Infantry Commander?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “The Lord Protector looks like an upright and honest type from first glance. If he faces off against the likes of Grand Preceptor Xie, I’m afraid he’ll only come to grief.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan laughed at Ning Xiaoyao’s words. “Then what kind of person is suited to be Xie Wenyuan’s opponent?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Malicious, venomous types,” Ning Xiaoyao said decisively. “I’d say you could do it.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So I’m a malicious, venomous person? </span></i><span style>Pei Yan was finally left speechless by Ning Xiaoyao’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know how to fight?” Ning Xiaoyao asked again, full of hope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve practiced martial arts since childhood,” Pei Yan replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao nodded. She’d read a few novels herself, and all the eunuchs in them had cultivated techniques from the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongfang_Bubai#Sunflower_Manual" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>Sunflower Manual</span></a><span style>. It was a superb brand of kung fu, so it was possible that Pei Yan was even some high-level expert. (</span><i><span style>Author: Are you sure the Sunflower Manual even exists in this world?</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan asked, “Your Majesty is brave enough to use me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao replied, “Then are you brave enough to accept the post of Nine Gates Infantry Commander?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Your Majesty dares to use me, then this commoner naturally dares to accept, but…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, then you’ll be the Nine Gates Infantry Commander,” Ning Xiaoyao clapped the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan was left completely floored. Even the Pei Clan members were dumbfounded. </span><i><span style>What just happened? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui only felt a headache coming on. </span><i><span style>“You,” </span></i><span style>he said to Ning Xiaoyao, before stopping to try again. “Your Majesty, this is a serious matter. You can’t joke around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guards were all staring at Ning Xiaoyao as well. </span><i><span style>Wasn’t the Lord Protector supposed to be the new commander? Why the sudden switch? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pointed at her mouth and said to Lou Zigui, “It’s not a joke. This is my golden mouth and pearly words---utterances that carry great weight.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn you and your golden mouth with pearly words! </span></i><span style>Supreme Commander Lou was about to blow his top.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does Your Majesty not know that I’ve been crippled?” Pei Yan had no choice but to bring up his injury now. Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes trailed downwards, and Lou Zigui immediately pressed a hand against her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t even think about it,” he said. He had seen how Ning Xiaoyao treated injuries, and it usually involved her touching the wound. </span><i><span style>Yet, where was Pei Yan’s injury? </span></i><span style>Just thinking about it made Supreme Commander Lou want to explode!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao had no choice but to move her gaze upwards. She could only gauge how much healing energy she needed after physically examining the wound. But now that she wasn’t allowed to touch the patient, well---Ning Xiaoyao paused and shook her hands to circulate her internal </span><i><span style>qi---</span></i><span style>then she’d just have to use all her energy, that’s all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you planning?” Pei Yan’s expression grew guarded when he saw Ning Xiaoyao’s face turn stern.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao placed a hand on Pei Yan’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t move,” Lou Zigui told Pei Yan. The Lord Protector grew restless and wanted to get up, but the old matriarch shook her head at him. It was impossible to think that His Majesty would hurt Pei Yan right here on clan grounds. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s hand rested lightly on Pei Yan’s shoulder for awhile. Right now, her healing abilities were but a scrap of her skills back in the apocalypse! </span><i><span style>But it should be enough, I think. </span></i><span style>After thinking that to herself, she lifted her fingers gently before touching them to his shoulder again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunlight spilling in through the lattice windows mixed with the soft green light coming from Ning Xiaoyao’s fingertips to turn into a brilliant, golden yellow. Lou Zigui caught the scent of fresh grass and forests again. When he finally tracked down the source, Ning Xiaoyao’s hands had already left Pei Yan’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan only felt a warm current travel throughout his body, leaving him very comfortable. But his heart felt both flustered and stupefied. </span><i><span style>What just happened to me? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao quickly stuffed two sugar beans into Pei Yan’s mouth and said, “Eat these, they’re miracle pills that’ll restore your masculinity. I, I uh, these are my master’s personal pills, you can’t find them anywhere else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan simply crunched on the beans, finding the taste familiar. </span><i><span style>You think I haven’t tasted sugar beans before?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui gave Pei Yan a doubtful glance before asking Ning Xiaoyao, “His injury’s really curable?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Basically,” Ning Xiaoyao said breezily. “If the Grand Preceptor can wreck it, then I can fix it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan lost his temper. “Your Majesty, are you humiliating this commoner?” After that, he prepared to spit out Ning Xiaoyao’s so-called ‘miracle pills.’ Ning Xiaoyao promptly pinched Pei Yan’s nose and muffled his mouth, forcing him to choke and swallow his ‘medicine.’ When she released the man, he clutched his throat and glared balefully back at her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao reached out a hand and brushed her fingers against Pei Yan’s angry eyelids. “You’re not dashing at all like this, ya know.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You,” </span></i><span style>Pei Yang wanted to beat her up, but suddenly felt his entire body turn limp. Soon enough, he couldn’t move at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three days from today,” Ning Xiaoyao told Pei Yan, “On the morning of the court assembly, I’ll be waiting for you at the Hall of Golden Chimes. Be there or be square.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan raged, “You---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“--fatuous ruler, right?” Ning Xiaoyao said smoothly. “Ol’ Supreme Commander’s already called me that, so you really should pick something else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this, many eyes turned to Lou Zigui, who chose to remain stoically silent. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You!” </span></i><span style>Pei Yan still wanted to curse her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao simply raised her hand and rendered him unconscious with a single slap. “I just realized, why should I let you curse me in the first place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said everyone in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old matriarch grabbed her walking stick and hurried over somewhat shakily to Ning Xiaoyao’s side. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can cure his injury, honest,” Ning Xiaoyao said before the old woman could speak up. “Old matriarch, you can have him test it out himself tomorrow. You don’t need me to explain the details, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both the old matriarch and the Lord Protector, who was only a step behind her, looked at Ning Xiaoyao in utter astonishment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Ning Xiaoyao relented. “Then I’ll elaborate. He can use his hands, or maybe find a girl to tumble around with in the she---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unable to bear any more of this topic from her, Supreme Commander Lou once against muffled His Majesty’s mouth. The old matriarch thought over Ning Xiaoyao’s words repeatedly before her hand trembled. The walking stick clattered from her fingers as she cried in a loud voice, “What Your Majesty means to say is that my son, my son is healed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pried apart Lou Zigui’s hands and took a deep breath. “Yeah, he’s good, ah. Didn’t I just tell you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, but he was castrated,” the old matriarch couldn’t quite believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it was cut off, it can grow back,” Ning Xiaoyao stood ramrod straight as she replied. “If the Grand Preceptor can wreck it, then I can fix it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-that’s impossible,” the Lord Protector shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whether or not it’s possible, we’ll know after he tries it out tomorrow,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “We’ll meet again three days later at the Hall of Golden Chimes. Be there or be square!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan simply laid there, unconscious. Meanwhile, the rest of the Pei Clan didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shall we go?” Ning Xiaoyao asked Lou Zigui. She didn’t expect the old matriarch to treat them to a meal, so they could probably leave the estate now that they were done. Lou Zigui bowed towards the old matriarch before taking Ning Xiaoyao out of the estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” one of the Dragon Guards asked after they left. “Is Second Young Master Pei’s injury really cured now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” Ning Xiaoyao affirmed. “I’ve even given him my miracle pills, so why wouldn’t he recover?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guards all looked at Ning Xiaoyao with mixed looks of respect and veneration. Ning Xiaoyao was very pleased. “How is it? Isn’t Your Majesty dashing enough to pierce through the Heavens?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Dragon Guards nodded their heads in agreement. Although His Majesty didn’t fit adjectives like </span><i><span style>‘dashing’ </span></i><span style>at all, they still esteemed him all the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have a candidate for the Nine Gates Infantry Commander now,” Ning Xiaoyao said with great satisfaction to Lou Zigui. “Supreme Commander, we should just sit and watch Pei Yan duke it out with the Grand Preceptor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His injury?” Lou Zigui asked instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I can’t cure him, may I be cursed to never have babies for the rest of my life,” Ning Xiaoyao solemnly vowed. “Does that make you feel better, Supreme Commander?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao along with him before he suddenly stopped walking. </span><i><span style>Whose babies will she have in the future, if not mine? In that case, </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui continued that train of thought as he looked at His Majesty Ning, </span><i><span style>Unless Pei Yan recovers, I’ll have to give up on having children and grandchildren of my own as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’ll be </span><i><span style>finnnne~” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao smiled at Lou Zigui like a flower in bloom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme Commander Lou could say nothing beyond remaining silent.</span></p>
