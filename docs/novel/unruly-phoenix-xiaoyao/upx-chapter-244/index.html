 <p><span style>“So the empress dowager wouldn’t have expected an ‘assassin’ to appear today, either?” Ning Xiaoyao caught a hint of Lou Zigui’s thinking before mentally lighting a candle in Empress Dowager Xie’s name. </span><i><span style>Looks like she’s due for abuse again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait here for me,” Lou Zigui turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can fetch my own water to bathe,” Ning Xiaoyao called after him. “Supreme Commander, you should do what you have to do. Go pick on the empress dowager, bully her good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to do something for your sake,” Lou Zigui patted Ning Xiaoyao’s head as he strode out the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Then you might as well bring me back a bag of sugar beans instead, ah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao saw a bloodstained Lou Zigui emerge from the inner rooms and quickly stepped to greet him in an urgent tone. “How is His Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should go take a look,” Lou Zigui tossed back before circling around him and heading out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao all but ran into the room. His Majesty might have superb medical skills, but by principle, doctors weren’t supposed to treat themselves! </span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Ning Xiaoyao saw Imperial Physician Gao rush in, she waved a hand at him from her perch on the bed. “Little Gao, so you’ve come, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao dashed right to the bed and almost wanted to yell at her. </span><i><span style>Is now the time to wave hello?! </span></i><span style>But he only looked doubtfully at her face and asked, “Is Your Majesty alright now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao laughed. “Did I scare you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao drew a blank before he cried, “This is impossible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stopped laughing and asked, “Did you </span><i><span style>want </span></i><span style>me to be seriously injured?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao quickly shook his head. </span><i><span style>How could I ever think that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do you mean by that?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao pointed at the blood all over her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Ning Xiaoyao took out a blood bag from inside her robes and tossed it on the bed. “See that? A blood bag. The blood on my body’s all fake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blood bag was made of some thin, unknown animal skin that would burst with the slightest force. It wasn’t transparent like modern blood bags, so Imperial Physician Gao couldn’t even tell if the contents held actual human blood. But as he looked at the intact bag, his gaze drifted back to Ning Xiaoyao again. </span><i><span style>This bag isn’t even broken, yet you’re saying that your blood is fake? Do you take me for an idiot?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I had two blood bags with me, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao’s face was wooden. “Your Majesty, the stab wound on your neck is still there.” </span><i><span style>It hasn’t even healed completely yet. Does Your Majesty think I’m blind?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, that,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “The empress was too moved when she saw me, so she hugged me and bit me on my neck. Heheh, her kisses were a little too strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> (#‵′)凸 , went Imperial Physician Gao. </span><i><span style>Do </span></i><b><i>you </i></b><i><span style>even trust what you’re saying right now?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine, </span><i><span style>relax,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao couldn’t reach out to pat Imperial Physician Gao’s shoulder from the bed, so she ended up patting his chest. “Supreme Commander should have told you everything already, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao nodded. “Yes, Supreme Commander told me, but he never mentioned you’d be covered in blood, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao sighed with feeling. </span><i><span style>Who knew the empress could be so callous?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, can this subject take your pulse?” Imperial Physician Gao asked. He was still uneasy at the sight of so much blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure,” Ning Xiaoyao offered her arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao half knelt by the bed as he held his breath and took Ning Xiaoyao’s pulse. Ning Xiaoyao said, “Little Gao, whatever happens after this, just do as Supreme Commander says.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, this subject obeys the decree,” Imperial Physician Gao replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And to outsiders, Little Gao,” Ning Xiaoyao continued, “Just cry if they ask you how I’m doing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao gave a start. “Your Majesty, does this subject need to cry every single time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hm? You can’t do that? Then just show a pained expression,” Ning Xiaoyao replied.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why would I wear a pained expression out of the blue for no reason? </span></i><span style>Imperial Physician Gao wondered privately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pondered before asking, “That needs acting skills too. Little Gao, do you know how?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao shook his head. He was only a doctor, so how would he know how to act?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll teach you,” Ning Xiaoyao said with a burst of enthusiasm. “When you’re acting, just think about this: </span><i><span style>my wife’s been snatched away and doesn’t love me anyone, but that other bastard!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Imperial Physician Gao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that doesn’t work, you can think of this too,” Ning Xiaoyao continued. “</span><i><span style>I worked so hard to raise my daughter, such a cute and adorable girl, such a gentle and soft girl, but now she’s running away with that bastard!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao could finally speak up. “Your Majesty, this subject has no daughters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urk,” Ning Xiaoyao’s expression grew grave. “Then make it your son that’s run off with someone else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao was mute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Other things like patricide and clan extermination feels too cruel to me,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she thought of more possibilities.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As if the first three aren’t cruel enough?! </span></i><span style>Imperial Physician Gao said, “Your Majesty, can you let this subject take your pulse in peace?” </span><i><span style>Can you shut up and let me see where you’re ill?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao creased her brows. “You </span><i><span style>still </span></i><span style>haven’t finished yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao decided that it’d be better if he didn’t talk. Speaking with His Majesty was torture!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” Shadowrain’s voice called from outside the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak on my behalf and let Third Rain in,” Ning Xiaoyao whispered quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty can’t speak?” Imperial Physician Gao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m playing dead, ah. What if a spy overhears me talking? Can you guarantee that Supreme Splendor Hall doesn’t have any agents, Little Gao?” Ning Xiaoyao looked at Imperial Physician Gao as if he was a fool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao simply pretended not to notice before he turned towards the door. “Come in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain heard Imperial Physician Gao’s voice instead of His Majesty and felt greatly alarmed. He pushed open the door and sprinted inside. There, Ning Xiaoyao was sitting on the bed and waving at him. In the span of a few seconds, Shadowrain had dropped to Hell and climbed to Heaven all over again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Rain, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao said in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain ran to the bed and stared at the blood on her clothes before he shrank back and trilled, “Your Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fake, it’s all fake,” Ning Xiaoyao said hastily. “The injury and blood’s both fake. Don’t cry, Third Rain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain’s eyes </span><i><span style>were </span></i><span style>turning red, but he rubbed them in response to her words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come, sit and talk.” Ning Xiaoyao said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain was too distraught to think straight, so he did exactly as he was told. The differences between master and servant didn’t matter now as he settled on the bed and asked, “Your Majesty, you’re really alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “If I was really in trouble, Supreme Commander wouldn’t leave me and busy himself about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain started at the stab wound on Ning Xiaoyao’s neck. She sighed in response. Because she’d saved the empress’s baby first, then detoxified both the poison from the soup and dagger, </span><i><span style>then </span></i><span style>stopped her bleeding and mended up her tissues, she’d used too much powers at once and lost her energy. Otherwise, she’d be perfectly scar-free by now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re really okay?” Shadowrain asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a minor injury. See? The skin’s almost grown back already,” Ning Xiaoyao stuck out her neck so Shadowrain could CHECK for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao stared at Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>That’s not what you told me just then.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The healing injury did nothing to alleviate Shadowrain’s fears. He still looked at Ning Xiaoyao with red eyes, his heart filled with distress as he grit his teeth. If possible, he’d go to the empress’s palace right now and murder that woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be like that,” Ning Xiaoyao coaxed him. “Come on, give Your Majesty a smile.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao looked up to stare at Shadowrain. </span><i><span style>It’d be absurd for anyone to smile under these circumstances, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain rubbed at his eyes again before he spoke. “Big bro and the rest sent me here to check on Your Majesty. Supreme Commander said Your Majesty was alright, but n-none---none of us could stop worrying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you’ve seen me now,” Ning Xiaoyao said with hasty nods. “See? I’m really alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Shadowrain replied. “I’ll tell big bro and the others.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the situation outside now?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain reported, “Supreme Commander’s leading the imperial guards to search the palace. He had Fourth Lightning surround the empress’s palace on all sides.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes widened. “He surrounded the empress’s palace first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain said, “The empress was shouting how Your Majesty had been attacked by an assassin on her way back to her own palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And then?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mute Nanny couldn’t stop her, so she knocked the empress unconscious,” Shadowrain said, but only felt a flash of hatred at the thought. </span><i><span style>Mute Nanny was too soft on her!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“My God,” Ning Xiaoyao fretted, “The empress is still pregnant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, don’t worry,” Shadowrain said. “The little prince is unharmed. We, we’ll definitely ensure that nothing ill befalls him.” </span><i><span style>No matter how much the empress deserves to die, her baby is still an imperial son of the first wife!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Alright. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao habitually scratched her palms. </span><i><span style>The Dragon Guards have no idea that the baby belong to that Xu fellow. </span></i><span style>“Suppose it’s a daughter instead?” she managed to ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whether it’s a prince or a princess, it’s still Your Majesty’s first child,” Shadowrain said seriously. “Even if I die, I’ll protect the little master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn’t know how to continue the conversation anymore. She didn’t dare to imagine Shadowrain’s reaction once he found out the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long are you planning to hold onto His Majesty’s hand?” Shadowrain barked at Imperial Physician Gao next. “Are you capable or not? If not, just speak up instead of pretending!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Imperial Physician Gao. </span><i><span style>Just who did I tick off today?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t,” Ning Xiaoyao consoled him. “Third Rain, don’t vent your anger on Little Gao, he’s innocent. Tell me, what else did Supreme Commander do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander brought big bro and the others to the empress dowager’s palace,” Shadowrain finally stopped glaring at Imperial Physician Gao. “Big bro said that the assassin is over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Ning Xiaoyao sighed. </span><i><span style>It’s good that Supreme Commander didn’t kill his way to the empress’s palace instead.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao couldn’t help but ask, “Supreme Commander went to the empress dowager’s palace? To meet with the empress dowager? But he’s not one of the inner ministers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain glared at him again. “Which is more important, a rogue assassin or the empress dowager?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “Third Rain, you should ask him this way: which is more important, my life or the empress dowager’s reputation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Imperial Physician Gao. </span><i><span style>Of course Your Majesty’s life is important, but the empress dowager would much rather choose death if she loses her reputation, right? </span></i><span style>All of a sudden, Imperial Physician Gao felt that he’d understood something. </span><i><span style>Was this all part of a plan to ally with the empress and ruin the empress dowager’s good name so as to force her to death? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Is your emperor really </span></i><b><i>that </i></b><i><span style>vicious? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to eat sugar beans,” Ning Xiaoyao said next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain hurriedly ran off to get some. Forget about sugar beans, he’d be willing to hunt down a dragon if His Majesty wanted dragon meat right now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao raised his eyes to look at Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Is eating sugar beans all you can think about at a time like this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s my pulse?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. </span><i><span style>If he keeps staring at me like that, I’ll want to beat him up. What does he mean by looking at me like I’m some villain?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao ducked his head. “Your Majesty is fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, your medical skills aren’t bad,” Ning Xiaoyao praised him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Your Majesty going to kill Esteemed Empress Dowager?” Imperial Physician Gao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt stifled. She’d just praised him, but here he was ruining her mood. </span><i><span style>There’s too much lack of love in this world!</span></i></p>
