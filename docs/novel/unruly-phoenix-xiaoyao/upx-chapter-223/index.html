 <p><span style>The little sparrow flew straight into the palace and found Ning Xiaoyao in the flower gardens outside the main hall. “Xiaoyao, </span><i><span style>chirp~” </span></i><span style>Wheat called out as he landed on her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao tossed Big Boss Black from her arms to the ground and went to stroke Wheat’s little head. “Wheat, why did you come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat’s head bobbed happily under Ning Xiaoyao’s petting as he spoke. “I just went to visit the Grand Preceptor’s estate, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh my God. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stiffened as her expression grew serious. “What’s the Grand Preceptor planning now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat chirped out the entire conversation between the Xie father and son, imitating their voices for Ning Xiaoyao’s sake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re just too wicked!” Wheat said with an aggrieved air. “They want to kill you, Xiaoyao, </span><i><span style>cheep!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not the main point,” Ning Xiaoyao said as her mouth twitched unhappily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miaow?” Big Boss Black’s fur stood on end. “That pair of villains is already planning to kill you and it’s still not the main point?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Black Tubby,” Ning Xiaoyao replied, “Do you think that father and son only thought of killing me today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black fell silent at that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The main point is,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “Xie Anji’s going to run away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do we do?” Wheat asked Ning Xiaoyao, who settled to sit beneath the big Wutong tree as she fed him crumbs of egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>from her pockets. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Little White Fatty scampered over and cried, “Xiaoyao, I’ll go bite the Grand Preceptor to death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You be good and go run a few more laps,” Ning Xiaoyao patted his head. “Little White Fatty, you can’t keep getting chubby. Otherwise, your mother Peach will definitely bite me death when she sees you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Arooo,” Little White Fatty’s head drooped before he went off to run laps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about </span><i><span style>I </span></i><span style>go bite the Grand Preceptor to death?” Big Boss Black suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re a cat, alright?” Ning Xiaoyao rolled her eyes at him. “Leaving aside the fact that you can’t kill him, now isn’t even the right time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black’s fur wanted to stand on end again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Your</span></i><span style> Supreme Commander said so,” Ning Xiaoyao said before adopting Lou Zigui’s unhurried tone. “Now is not the time to kill Xie Wenyuan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black stopped protesting with that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat ate the delicious crumbs of egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>as he asked, “Then what are you going to do, Xiaoyao? I could take my siblings to poop on the Grand Preceptor’s head?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wanted to cry. </span><i><span style>If it’s not biting people to death, it’s pooping on them instead. Just who did they learn these things from?! </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Who do you think? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o )</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about you ask Supreme Commander?” Big Boss Black suggested next. “You’re a stupid human, but Supreme Commander’s very smart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>You’re </span></i><span style>the one who’s stupid,” Ning Xiaoyao stood up and dusted off her butt with a snort. “He wants to run away? As if it’s that simple! I’ll go stop Xie Anji this very night. <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f9b4968d919c8bb9">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#*<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ae8fee">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#*(<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="85a4c5">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>$, what did I say before? The Grand Preceptor’s a piece of sh**, so of course he’d come to meddle in our war plans!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao, you’re so smart,” Wheat exclaimed in a reverent tone. Ning Xiaoyao laughed out loud. Big Boss Black just licked the fur by his mouth. He wasn’t going to associate himself with these idiots who’d never seen </span><i><span style>real </span></i><span style>intelligent humans before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat, do me a favor,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she cupped the sparrow in her hands. “Help me keep an eye on Xie Anji and see which city gate he’s leaving from. Then have some other little pal pass on the message to me, okay? Once everything’s finished, I’ll treat you to </span><i><span style>guoba. </span></i><span style>Chef Huang’s making some egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>right now, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay~” Wheat agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black said, “He already said that the Grand Preceptor’s sending Xie Anji to the Wu region. That means he’ll definitely use the south gates, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re the type of cat who doesn’t understand Grand Preceptor’s crafty ways,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “For the sake of hiding Xie Anji’s whereabouts, wouldn’t he make his son go through a different door? Doesn’t the Grand Preceptor know how to make a roundabout trip?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black was forced to admit that the ninny had her flashes of brilliance at times, too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll go keep an eye on Xie Anji,” Wheat hopped onto Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder and nuzzled against her cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful,” Ning Xiaoyao tilted her head to nuzzle him back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm.” Wheat then flew away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re really not going to tell Supreme Commander a thing that Wheat told you?” Big Boss Black asked as he looked at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Your Supreme Commander’s busy with transferring troops. That’s a big task, so he can’t be distracted, oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black dug into the ground with his claws as his tone grew vicious. “Fine then. If Xie Anji doesn’t behave, I’ll claw him a face full of blood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like that, Ning Xiaoyao began to make preparations at the palace for stopping Xie Anji even as he packed up his things and made ready to leave. As the skies approached dusk, a </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>from the empress dowager’s palace came searching for Ning Xiaoyao until she found her at the little kitchens, then told her that the empress dowager was feeling unwell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was currently holding half a pot full of Chef Huang’s freshly made egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba. </span></i><span style>She glanced at the </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>then said, “If she’s not feeling well, go find an imperial physician. What’s the use of coming to me? It’s not like the empress dowager would eat any prescription I gave her, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>remained half-bowed as she spoke. “Your Majesty, Esteemed Empress Dowager wanted to see </span><i><span style>you</span></i><span style>.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For the sake of keeping both of us in a good mood, I think it’s better that I don’t go,” Ning Xiaoyao pursed her lips. “</span><i><span style>Mama, </span></i><span style>you can just tell that to the empress dowager.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said the </span><i><span style>mama. Wouldn’t those words only infuriate the empress dowager to death?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Come, have a </span><i><span style>guoba,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao picked out a </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>and handed it to the </span><i><span style>mama. </span></i><span style>“Chef Huang made them, they’re super delicious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>bit into a mouthful of </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>in front of Ning Xiaoyao and swallowed it down. She felt fine afterwards and didn’t die, so she silently exhaled in relief. </span><i><span style>Looks like His Majesty wasn’t planning to poison me to death.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After the empress dowager’s </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>finally withdrew, Ning Xiaoyao forgot all about this incident. She munched on her egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>while planning how to give Xie Anji another thrashing. Meanwhile, the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>returned to the empress dowager’s palace and stood in front of her mistress, too afraid to speak. Seeing this, Empress Dowager Xie knew that Ning Yu wasn’t planning to come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever His Majesty said to you, you can tell This Dowager directly. This Dowager won’t fault you for it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>stammered out Ning Xiaoyao’s exact sentence---</span><i><span style>for the sake of keeping both of us in a good mood, I think it’s better that I don’t go. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Empress Dowager Xie didn’t lose her temper like usual, but only told the </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>“This Dowager understands. Go make some arrangements to have Zhou </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>head delivered to Iron Buddha Temple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>hastily accepted her orders before asking, “Is there any message for Esteemed Empress?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just say that it’s from This Dowager,” Empress Dowager Xie replied breezily. “And that it was His Majesty who did the deed, but This Dowager snatched back that </span><i><span style>mama’s </span></i><span style>head on account of the fact that she’d accompanied the empress for all of her life, thus saving part of the corpse from being eaten up by dogs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>felt afraid upon hearing the empress dowager’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And tell the empress that His Majesty has already drawn the Lord Protector’s estate, Tao Yu from the military barracks, and Prince Fu all over to his side,” Empress Dowager Xie added. “To His Majesty, the soldiers of the Zhou Clan are negligible at this point. Of course it’d be best if he had them too, but otherwise he’ll just destroy them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, this servant has remembered empress dowager’s words,” the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>accepted the decree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on,” Empress Dowager Xie had her withdraw. Once she was gone, the empress dowager picked up Ning Xin by her side and rocked the baby until he laughed. Only then did she smile back in turn and murmur, “Xin’er don’t worry, imperial mother will definitely protect and guard you well.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As for Ning Yu, </span></i><span style>Empress Dowager Xie mused as she continued to rock her son into smiles before talking to herself, “I’ve given that girl a chance. If she says she won’t meet me, then she doesn’t recognize me as her mother. She can’t blame me for eating her alive, then.” (</span><i><span style>Author: So, His Majesty </span></i><b><i>just </i></b><i><span style>gave up her sole chance to live with that rejection just then? </span></i><span style>(￢_￢) )</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>After dusk, all the lamps were lit in Lou Zigui’s quarters. Tao Yu brought along his trusted subordinates from the military barracks to sit in a circle around Lou Zigui and a portion of his Black Frost Cavalry. All of them were discussing details in low voices. There was brush and paper before Lou Zigui, which he frequently used to take notes and draw diagrams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao snuck to the half-open window to watch the people working inside. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It looks like Supreme Commander’s very busy,” Big Boss Black whispered from her shoulder. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao perked up her ears to listen to Lou Zigui speak, before she complained, “I don’t recognize a single name he’s saying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ninny,” Big Boss Black said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui thought he heard a cat’s meow and quickly glanced looked out the window, but all he saw through the half-open screen were a bunch of green trees. There was no sign of a cat or Miss Ning. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander?” Tao Yu called to him softly when he noticed the man looking distracted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s keep talking,” Supreme Commander turned back to Tao Yu, his expression back to normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the front hall of Supreme Splendor Hall, Shadowgale had already gathered his fellow brothers. He next addressed Ning Xiaoyao, who had wandered onto the scene mid-way. “Your Majesty, Xie Anji’s really going to run away tonight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded. She picked up Little White Fatty, who’d been trailing her the entire way, and asked Shadowgale, “Windy, can I bring along Little White Fatty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale glanced over at the fat black cat already sitting on Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulders, then at the chubby little wolf pup in her arms, his mouth twitching. </span><i><span style>Is she planning to go on an all-out brawl?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Arooo~” Little White Fatty tried to flatter Shadowgale by licking at his clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale’s lips twitched again. </span><i><span style>Is this a wolf or a dog?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Windy?” Ning Xiaoyao called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Your Majesty wants to take him along, then go ahead,” Shadowgale replied. “Xie Anji’s skills are only so-so and doesn’t need Your Majesty to exert yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, you can’t say things like that,” Ning Xiaoyao rebutted him, “The Grand Preceptor will definitely send top-level experts to guard his son.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale was quick to recant himself. “Your Majesty lectures rightly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao was lost. “I didn’t lecture you, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Shadowgale. </span><i><span style>These are just conventional expressions. All officials and servants say them in the presence of the emperor.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” the Poison Sect Head and Yan Hong appeared with Mute Nanny while Shadowgale was still fretting over how to explain the concept of formalities. Shadowgale’s expression fell at the sight of them before he looked back at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” he questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao told him not to be nervous while she grinned cheerfully at the new duo. “Come, come, the two of you should join me and Windy over here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sect Head and Yan Hong approached Ning Xiaoyao and kneeled to pay their respects. Shadowgale instinctively stood in front of Ning Xiaoyao to shield her, so she stuck out her head from behind him to say, “Come and rise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale asked in a small voice, “Your Majesty is going to bring them along?”</span></p>
