 <p>Chapter&nbsp;107: A large house on Fragrant Gauze Alley<span class="hidden-text">&nbsp;Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie’s letter was only a few lines at most. It told Empress Dowager Xie to keep enduring, while the last line read: </span><i><span style>It is impossible for your oldest younger brother to recover from his blow. If you insist on protecting him, it’ll harm the image of our Xie Clan. This subject has already written to admit his wrongs. In addition, Xie Anwu has betrayed the clan and is currently inside the palace.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie held the letter in her right hand while her left pressed against the armrest of her chair. Waves cascaded in her heart, but she knew that there was nothing else she could do. The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>who delivered the letter remained standing with her head bowed. She seemed much calmer than the other </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>in the empress dowager’s palace, who didn’t even dare to breathe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was née Qin who was incompetent,” Empress Dowager Xie snarled, “She’s the one who couldn’t earn her husband’s favor, but in the end it was my little brother who was in the wrong? She deserves to die! And that son of a servant, Xie Anwu, he deserves to die too!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody replied to her words. Née Qin was currently under the protection of His Majesty, so what could the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>say?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go take out 5,000 taels worth of silver drafts,” Empress Dowager Xie ordered a </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>by her side. The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>hastily went to the inner rooms before returning with a few silver drafts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take these out of the palace,” Empress Dowager Xie instructed the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>who delivered the letter. “I want to give this to my brother. You must be sure to give them into his hands. Also, pass on this message: Even if I can’t live in this empress dowager’s palace, I’m still going to protect him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to Grand Preceptor Xie’s resolution to break off relations, Empress Dowager Xie wasn’t quite so ruthless towards the Xie Clan’s eldest son by the first wife. She had known Xie Anyi for years and had grown up with him as siblings. For the sake of those feelings, Empress Dowager Xie refused to see his future prospects ruined into a life of despair. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>who delivered the letter accepted the silver drafts, knelt down to kowtow to Empress Dowager Xie, and retreated from the palace. Empress Dowager Xie waved a hand and sent the covers of her bed tumbling to the ground. Then her tea set and fruit bowl were smashed into pieces against the floor. The various </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>still left in the palace still didn’t dare to make a peep. The empress dowager had been left in dire straits after fighting a few rounds with His Majesty without gaining a single advantage. They couldn’t figure out how she was planning to protect her brother in her current state. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao ground her teeth as she spied on the scene from the roof. </span><i><span style>5,000 taels of silver in silver drafts! </span></i><span style>She was poor as death, but the empress dowager could take out 5,000 taels on a whim! Oil Jar was perched on Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder, and both of them were thoroughly drenched by the rain. When he heard Ning Xiaoyao grind her teeth, he rolled his eyes in thought before speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao, it’s okay if the empress dowager doesn’t like you. Supreme Commander likes you fine, ah. Just think, she’ll definitely die before you, so it’ll be Supreme Commander who’ll always stay by your side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s lips twitched. In the eyes of this little mouse, were she and Supreme Commander Lou already married? “That there,” she said as she stroked his head. “Right now Supreme Commander and I are hated enemies. My old dad killed his father and brothers, oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar said, “Will it work if you apologize to Supreme Commander?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stood on the roof, her eyes following after the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>who had delivered the letter to the empress dowager. When she heard Oil Jar’s question, she suddenly remembered a well-known saying in her world. </span><i><span style>If apologies worked, would zombies still bite you? </span></i><span style>She heaved a long sigh before taking Oil Jar to jump off the roof, leaving a hole via exposed roof tile behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because Ning Xiaoyao had been blocking the hole with her body, no rain had fallen through. But now that she was gone, raindrops fell through the hole to drip onto the boxes below. The sound of the rain outside completely muffled the noise for Empress Dowager Xie and her </span><i><span style>mama. </span></i><span style>A fine drizzle began to fall within the palace…</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao, where are we going?” Oil Jar asked in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao had randomly plucked a luxuriant, leafy vine from a flower bed as she walked by. As she braided the vine, she said, “Supreme Commander told me that no one’s able to enter the empress dowager’s palace. So how did that subordinate of Grand Preceptor Xie’s get in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar said, “She flew inside.” He’d seen how that </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>had flew right over the palace walls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s flipping over the wall, thanks,” Ning Xiaoyao finished weaving her hat of vines and places it on Oil Jar’s head. “Judging by that </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>I can tell that the Grand Preceptor has an information network in the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar didn’t know what an information network was, but it sounded serious. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I follow her, I might be able to find out the other members of the information network,” Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes were bright and piercing in the rain. She’d track down the members of Grand Preceptor Xie’s information network within the palace, then take the silver drafts from their very hands!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao followed the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>to the laundry department, then a head eunuch who came in contact with her from the Department of Rites. A younger eunuch from the same department met with the head eunuch, so Ning Xiaoyao followed him next to the imperial kitchens, where he talked to a middle-aged </span><i><span style>mama. </span></i><span style>She took a break with Oil Jar in the kitchens by splitting a mantou between them before following the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>to the clothing department. Ning Xiaoyao didn’t know much about the palace, but she ended up trailing the members of the Grand Preceptor’s information network until she went through all 24 offices and departments within the palace itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, so many people, ah!” Oil Jar had already turned dizzy from all the stalking, and sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was currently tailing a vegetable delivery cart outside the palace. She ground her teeth and said to Oil Jar, “See how ruthless our enemies are!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie even had subordinates housed in unoccupied residences within the palace. Was this the imperial palace, or a second Grand Preceptor’s estate? Ning Xiaoyao felt thoroughly stifled. One of the gate guards opened the door to allow the horse cart to pass before closing it immediately. He felt something pass by over his head during the process, but when he looked up, all he saw was rain and a dark night sky. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was I imagining things? </span></i><span style>The imperial guard blinked before returning to his post.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar clapped once they were out of the palace. “Xiaoyao, so you can fly, too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was quite modest. “That was just a jump.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jumping like flying? </span></i><span style>Oil Jar expressed his admiration of Ning Xiaoyao once more. Ning Xiaoyao looked at Oil Jar with an expression that invited him to praise her some more, even as she said, “Let’s not create a personality cult around me, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao, you’re so amazing,” Oil Jar sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes crinkled into a smile. </span><i><span style>It feels great to be praised~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The horse cart headed towards the north of the city, crisscrossing through streets and alleys and even over six separate bridges. Finally, it entered into a long, narrow lane. Oil Jar glanced at the lane and said, “This is Fragrant Gauze Alley. Xiaoyao, Oil Lamp lives around here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The horse cart stopped before the third house on the left. Ning Xiaoyao recalled that Oil Lamp had told her this was where the head steward of the Xie Clan, Xie Laibao, kept his lover. The middle-aged driver walked up to the door and softly knocked against its surface. It opened just wide enough to fit five fingers in the crack. The horse cart driver only spoke a few words with the person inside, before handing over his oil-paper package containing the empress dowager’s silver drafts. Then he returned to his cart, whipped the horse, and kept going.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao walked to the newly shut door and lifted her head to look at the two meter tall gates. </span><i><span style>So Grand Preceptor Xie knows that Xie Laibao has a lover as well as a wife? One of them keeps a mistress, while the other keeps a lover. They’re a pair of scoundrels! </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Why are you worrying about those kind of details at a time like this?</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should we go in?” Oil Jar asked nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pressed her ear against the door to listen for sounds inside. Once she was sure there was nobody near, she patted Oil Jar’s back comfortingly and scaled the wall on the right side of the door to get inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should I go find Oil Lamp?” Oil Jar asked in a small voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “If you can’t find me, we’ll arrange to reconvene here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Oil Jar jumped off of Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder and disappeared like a streak of smoke. Ning Xiaoyao ran ahead until she caught up with the gatekeeper. He was dressed like a retainer of the house, and she followed him all the way through the covered corridor and two separate courtyards before they reached a little flower garden. Ning Xiaoyao saw the retainer enter a hazy, candlelit room and give the silver drafts to the middle-aged person within. He also repeated Empress Dowager Xie’s message word by word before withdrawing to leave. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The middle-aged person sat staring at the oilpaper package in the room for a long time before rising to their feet. They pressed a switch located at the top of a treasure cabinet to reveal a secret compartment hidden in the wall, then slipped the silver drafts inside. Next, the middle-aged person closed the hidden compartment and blew out the candle before leaving the room that resembled a study. Ning Xiaoyao stood, waiting outside the window until she was sure the person wasn’t returning, before running inside the room and pressing the switch herself. The entire process took less than two seconds for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hidden compartment was quite large, and inside lay two copper boxes as well as a stack of letters. In addition, Ning Xiaoyao noticed as she grinned from ear to ear, there were 24 sheafs of silver drafts! She didn’t have time to count all the money, but stuffed the letters and silver drafts into the oilpaper package from the empress dowager. Then she took off her outer robes and wrapped them around the package as well as the two copper boxes. Once she placed everything on her back, she left the room in high spirits. She’d struck it rich again, so she hadn’t come in vain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao!” Oil Lamp cried. He’d followed Oil Jar to track her down by her scent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shh!” Ning Xiaoyao grabbed the banisters of the covered walkway and crouched down. Two guards on night watch were standing at the other end of the walkway. </span></p>
 <p><span style>One of them shone the lantern in the walkway and said, “What was that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Squeak, squeak~” Oil Jar made some noise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two guards left when they heard the mouse squeak. They had no obligation to catch mice for their master. Ning Xiaoyao sat on the floor of the corridor as she felt Oil Lamp’s recovered tail. “Have you been doing well lately, Oil Lamp?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m doing very well,” Oil Lamp said. “Xiaoyao, Oil Jar said you came to catch some bad guys. Did you get them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao patted the giant bundle on her back with a grin. “I struck it rich.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said Oil Lamp and Oil Jar. </span><i><span style>What about the bad guys?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Ahhh!” </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the midst of her happiness, she heard a distant scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao, what’s the matter?” Oil Jar scrambled up to perch on Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao raised a hand to point in the direction of the scream. “It sounds like someone’s being hurt over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Lamp looked in the direction she was pointing and ran up Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder as well, sitting right next to Oil Jar. He lowered his voice and said, “That’s the back gardens of the estate. Rumors say there’s a big treasure deposit there!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A depository of treasures, or a treasure depot? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes shone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar said, “But Xiaoyao said someone was being hurt over there. Elder cousin, have you never gone to the back gardens before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s a big green snake who lives there called King Flower. We can’t go to a place like that,” Oil Lamp said seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao and Oil Jar both fell silent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘So did King Flower just bite someone?’ </span></i><span style>thought Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Elder cousin Oil Lamp’s house even has a giant snake, how terrifying!’ </span></i><span style>thought Oil Jar.</span></p>
