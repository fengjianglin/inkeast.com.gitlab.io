 <p>Chapter 200: Supreme Commander worries his horse to death&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s horse reached the entrance to the lane. His eyes swept over the chaotic scene before spotting Ning Xiaoyao fighting amongst them against the Nine Gates Provincial Commander’s men with a brick in her hand. He saw men falling left and right every time she raised her brick, a valiant image that served to soothe the ruffles in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Charge!” Shadowgale led the Dragon Guards forward. </span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a flash of light from the wall opposite Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Watch out!” Lou Zigui shouted as he threw his sword, scabbard and all, towards the wall. An arrow flew out from the flash and crashed into Lou Zigui’s sword before dropping to the ground. Shadowgale leaped onto the wall and began to fight with the archer hidden beyond it. Lou Zigui reached Ning Xiaoyao and simply dragged her out of the scuffle before asking her outright, “What are you doing here?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “I ran into this mess by accident, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t believe it,” Supreme Commander Lou rejected flatly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>How come he doesn’t believe me even when I’m telling the truth?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>With the Dragon Guards joining the fight and half of the Nine Gate Provincial Commander’s men already defeated by Ning Xiaoyao herself, the battle quickly ended. Their enemies laid fallen on the ground without a single one that had escaped. Shadowgale cut off both hands of the offending archer before dragging him in front of Ning Xiaoyao, only to discover that the man’s face was already purplish-black. He was dead. There was no blood in his mouth, but his mouth and teeth were all the same purplish-black.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Suicide by poison,” Ning Xiaoyao concluded as she pointed at left side of the archer’s oral cavity. She was squatting on the ground with Shadowgale on her side as she continued to explain. “See that? The blackest tooth is over here, so that’s probably where he hid the poison. It felt the effects of the toxin first, so it had the greatest color change.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty is wise and brilliant,” Shadowgale replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao only sighed. “So what if Your Majesty is wise and brilliant? I can’t save this person anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale furrowed his brows. “Your Majesty still wanted to save him?” </span><i><span style>He should die by a thousand cuts, so why bother saving him?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s one of the Grand Preceptor’s men,” Ning Xiaoyao said quietly. “This would’ve been a living witness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grand Preceptor?” Shadowgale’s brows furrowed into a knot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry,” Ning Xiaoyao raised a hand to smooth out his forehead. “At most I’d used him to gross out the Grand Preceptor a bit. He wouldn’t help at all when it comes to killing the Grand Preceptor himself. Come on, cheer up a bit, stop furrowing your eyebrows. Windy, you---hmm?” Before she could finish, Lou Zigui had pulled her to her feet by the back of her collar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s the Grand Preceptor?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao raised her head to stare at the skies. Up there, Sesame Speck was flying in circles and chirping. “The Grand Preceptor ran away just then, </span><i><span style>cheep~”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The old man just ran away,” Ning Xiaoyao told Lou Zigui. “Maybe he found out that his third nephew couldn’t beat me, so he fled. Huh? That’s right, where’s that third nephew?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re saying Xie Anyuan brought troops here?” Lou Zigui asked hastily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “That was his name. Well dang, where did he go?” It was a dark and moonless night, so Ning Xiaoyao didn’t spot him after sweeping her gaze over the people on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miaow!” Big Boss Black meowed loudly. Following the noise, everyone glanced over to see His Majesty’s cat perched on top of a military officer’s belly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Black Tubby,” Ning Xiaoyao ran towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black jumped off Xie Anyuan’s stomach and said “Xiaoyao, this cat took care of that bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao knelt down and turned Xie Anyuan to lie on his back, only to give a start of disbelief. “Black Tubby, you killed him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black was stunned as well. He jumped onto Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder and loomed over Xie Anyuan .”All this cat did was bite off his finger, but he’s dead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course a missing finger wouldn’t take Xie Anyuan’s life, but at the sight of his bloody leg, Ning Xiaoyao realized what was the matter. “He died from poison.” The blood was turning black from the toxins within. Big Boss Black licked his whiskers, a little disappointed. </span><i><span style>So I wasn’t the one who killed this bastard. </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: You actually want to kill someone?</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stood behind Ning Xiaoyao, looking at Xie Anyuan’s corpse with a gloomy expression. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He wanted to shoot His Majesty with a poisoned arrow, but ended up shooting himself by accident and dying from his own toxin,” the Poison Sect leader walked up as he explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rose to her feet and looked at him. “If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t have gotten involved in this mess. Just because he’s a bad guy, you’re not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said the Poison Sect leader. </span><i><span style>This little Majesty sure changes faces fast.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Take them into custody,” Lou Zigui ordered. All of the Poison Sect members grew tense at his words. </span><i><span style>Are we going to fight another round right after the last one?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This commoner will follow His Majesty’s wishes,” the Poison Sect leader placed both hands behind his back as he bowed his head to submit. Seeing this, none of the other members made to rebel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Escort them back to the palace,” Lou Zigui told Shadowgale, who looked at Ning Xiaoyao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She pointed at the justice court </span><i><span style>yamen </span></i><span style>attendants still standing on the side and asked, “Then what about the justice courts?” </span><i><span style>The police are supposed to catch the bad guys. If you catch them instead, shouldn’t you give the police an explanation?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to bother with them,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.” Since Lou Zigui said so, Ning Xiaoyao told Shadowgale, “Then Windy, I’ll have to trouble you to take those Poison Sect members back to the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale personally led the group to take the prisoners back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sect Leader?” one of the members asked questioningly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right now, only the palace can keep us safe in this capital,” the Poison Sect leader replied. “If you want to live, then don’t talk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Walk faster!” a Dragon Guard barked at them. The Poison Sect members fell silent. Although they still didn’t understand why Grand Preceptor Xie wanted to kill them, they knew that His Majesty was the only person left in the world who could protect them from </span><i><span style>that</span></i><span style> man’s wrath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They want to rely on your strength,” Lou Zigui murmured to Ning Xiaoyao after the people had left. None of the prisoners were good people, especially if they used to follow the Grand Preceptor. Most likely, they’d done their share of wicked deeds. Just the attempts at facial reconstruction surgery alone were enough to kill countless youths. Ning Xiaoyao’s face was wooden as she considered the implications. </span><i><span style>Am I really taking in these sinning bastards?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re villains,” Lou Zigui seemed to read her mind as he stroked her head. “But they can help you face off against Xie Wenyuan. Unless he’s dead, they can’t live either, so they’re the best blade for you to use against him.” He painted the situation in a very cultured way, but Ning Xiaoyao mentally translated it as </span><i><span style>‘have the Poison Sect fight the Grand Preceptor in a dog-eat-dog world.’ </span></i><span style>She sighed and couldn’t help but think of another famous saying---</span><i><span style>no one is an enemy forever, ah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui pressed a hand on Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder and turned her away from the sight of Shadowgale departing into the distance so she was facing himself. “Did you catch wind of the news ahead of time? You knew the Poison Sect members would run off to here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Didn’t I tell you, I ran into them by accident?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Such a coincidence? </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui didn’t quite believe Ning Xiaoyao’s words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t believe me?” Ning Xiaoyao asked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s not talk about this anymore,” Lou Zigui lifted his head to look over at the justice courts attendants instead. He almost forgot that this girl wasn’t just anyone. If she could have spies in the Grand Preceptor’s estate, finding out about the Poison Sect wasn’t a difficult affair at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>yamen </span></i><span style>attendants would be idiots if they couldn’t figure out the identity of the youth they had ran into by now. They were truly blind to almost raise a hand against His Majesty. The very thought made their legs feel weak. Meanwhile, the leader who’d called Ning Xiaoyao shifty-eyed and a villain was thinking of all kinds of ways to die. Lou Zigui waved at the attendants, and the leader immediately peed his pants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take these men,” Lou Zigui pointed to the fallen soldiers of the Nine Gates Provincial Commander on the ground, “And put them in the justice court prisons. Without His Majesty’s imperial decree, no one is allowed to bail them out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The leader trembled as he accepted the orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty…” Lou Zigui trailed off as he turned to ask Ning Xiaoyao for any last words, only to find in surprise that she was already gone! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“S-Supreme Commander,” a Dragon Guard raised a hand as he said in a small voice, “His Majesty said he still had official business to take care of and to leave things here to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did Xiao---His Majesty go to do?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guard shrugged and replied, “Official business.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of official business?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now the Dragon Guard was stuck. His Majesty hadn’t told him, so how was he supposed to know?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rested a palm against his forehead as he stared at the ground. “Did that cat go off with His Majesty too?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” the Dragon Guard nodded. “And two sparrows as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone, including the justice court attendants, all looked at the Dragon Guard as if he was an idiot. A cat leaving with His Majesty was one thing, but sparrows were wild birds, not pets. </span><i><span style>Would they really follow after a human? </span></i><span style>The battle horse Little Red neighed multiple times at Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>Are you content with leaving a cat and two sparrows to look after Ning Xiaoyao? What if they run into the Grand Preceptor and he wants to kill her again? Master, why are you still standing around here?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that horse about to run wild again?” a Dragon Guard by Lou Zigui’s side wondered out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Red struck his hooves against the ground. </span><i><span style>It serves my master right that he still can’t catch a wife. His attitude is enough to worry me me to death! </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Hey hey, don’t be like that. </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked at his battle horse and suddenly recalled how he seemed to hear the chirping of sparrows before his stallion went wild. </span><i><span style>Did I miss something somewhere? </span></i><span style>He felt another headache coming on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When we finish rescuing the people,” Ning Xiaoyao was currently running like mad through the streets while speaking to Sesame Speck and Wheat, “I’ll treat you guys to </span><i><span style>mantou. </span></i><span style>Big white </span><i><span style>mantou </span></i><span style>made from wheat flour!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black, who was perched around her shoulders, added, “You should think about </span><i><span style>saving</span></i><span style> them first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao patted her chest. “With my skills, who can’t I beat? Black Tubby, look at your conscience and tell me who’s stronger, me or Supreme Commander?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Big Boss Black. </span><i><span style>I refuse to consider that question.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Sesame Speck spoke up next. “Xiaoyao, it’s the house up ahead. That one belongs to the empress dowager.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stopped at the head of a street. At the very end was a house with walls so high that not a speck of light peeked out from its depths. It was nigh impossible for anyone outside to see the area within as well. She took a deep breath. </span><i><span style>Here’s Empress Dowager Xie’s old haunt outside the palace!</span></i></p>
