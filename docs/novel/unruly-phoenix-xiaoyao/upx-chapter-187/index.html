 <p>Chapter&nbsp;187: Harming others because of jealousy&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being scared by Ning Xiaoyao, Madame Fu was now kneeling on the ground. Her head whipped towards Lady Wang at the emperor’s words. </span><i><span style>After this gets out, will anyone be willing to marry my daughter? Did her ladyship ever think of the consequences when she trapped the head commander in front of my daughter’s room on purpose?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be fooled,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she looked at Madame Fu. She’d seen the interactions between the two women loud and clear. Although she had no idea who Madame Fu was, she had a sense that she was probably Xie Duoying’s mother. “Do you really think she’ll uphold justice for your daughter’s sake? She’s only using your daughter as a weapon,” Ning Xiaoyao explained for Madame Fu’s sake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Fu lowered her head, her hands digging into the dirt. She fully understood Lady Wang’s intentions, but what could she do as a mere concubine? How could she protect her own daughter? This was the child she gave birth to, but the girl didn’t even have the right to call her ‘mother.’ </span></p>
 <p><span style>After being exposed, Lady Wang fell mute for a while before she raised her voice again. “A daughter of the Xie Clan will never live an ignoble existence! This wife only wants to seek justice for Fifth Young Miss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y-Your Ladyship?!” Madame Fu shrieked. </span><i><span style>Her Ladyship is shouting so loudly, does she really want to push my daughter to the point of no return?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut your mouth!” Lady Wang screeched at Madame Fu in return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should we go in?” the Lord Protector asked Lou Zigui from their position at the entrance to the courtyard. Lou Zigui stood with his hands behind his back and slightly shook his head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think we could really go in and kill the Grand Preceptor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector fell silent. </span><i><span style>Is Lou Zigui joking with me? Yet his face looks completely serious.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You shut up,” Ning Xiaoyao shouted at Lady Wang. “Would our Windy actually want to look at your Xie Duoying? What face you have! The palace is full of beauties, so if he really took a fancy to someone, wouldn’t it be a girl from the palace? Do you think your family’s Xie Duoying is some sort of celestial fairy? Dream on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the Dragon Guards tugged on Ning Xiaoyao’s sleeve. He knew His Majesty was speaking up for the head commander’s sake, but all that nonsense about eyeing beauties from the palace was unnecessary! </span><i><span style>Words like that could condemn a man to death!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re both made of the same stuff,” Ning Xiaoyao was in the midst of battling with Lady Wang, so she never noticed the guard tugging on her sleeve. Ignoring him completely, she stared daggers at Lady Wang and said, “All of you just want to toy with Windy with your motherf**king beauty schemes, can’t you think of something else for once?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His Majesty’s words came as a massive information dump. Even the Lord Protector standing by the entrance couldn’t help but wonder who His Majesty was associating with Lady Wang. But soon enough, many people in the courtyard seemed to understand what Ning Xiaoyao meant. </span><i><span style>Who else would have the means to try a beauty scheme against the head commander of the Dragon Guards? Besides the Esteemed Empress Dowager in the palace proper, there were no other possible candidates, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Windy is a Dragon Guard,” Ning Xiaoyao said with a cold glare, “Could he be moved by lust? Lady Wang, are you cursing the imperial family for being too blind to pick their subordinates?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Wang really hadn’t intended to try a beauty scheme against Shadowgale. She was simply using the fact that Shadowgale had dropped by to capture him in a trap. But now Ning Xiaoyao was accusing her of so many things that she couldn’t take it. </span><i><span style>Deriding the royal family for having no insight? If I had the guts to do that, I would have risked my life to fight against His Majesty and save my son!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao,” a voice could be heard coming from Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder. Ning Xiaoyao glanced down and saw A’Mo perched there.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Cough,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao walked to the side and lowered her voice. “A’Mo, why have you come now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Windy came to save Fifth Young Miss,” A’Mo told Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes grew wide. </span><i><span style>As expected, there’s a story behind all of this! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It took effort for A’Mo to speak while standing on Ning Xiaoyao’s collar, so he simply crawled into her ear instead. “The old madame had died, so Fifth Young Miss has been having a terrible time at the estate. All of the Xie Clan daughters bully her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Eh, are they jealous because the old madame liked her best?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know, ah,” A’Mo said, “In any case, all the girls said that the old madame’s gone blind with age. My big brother says all humans become blind when they’re older.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not an issue of eyesight,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “Go back and tell your big brother that they’re just cursing the old madame for having no insight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” A’Mo expressed his understanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keep talking,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “What happened next?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next, they found some rogue man to ruin Fifth Young Miss,” A’Mo said, “Those girls arranged everything. While Fifth Young Miss was bathing, they’d get him to do the bad deed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her chin. “So that rogue prepared to go inside the room when Fifth Young Miss yelled for help, and then my Windy appeared?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A’Mo said, “Wah! You’re so smart, Xiaoyao!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was quite modest. “I’m only so-so. Forget about smarts, I’m just someone as dashing as the Heavens!” (</span><i><span style>Author: How does that count as being modest? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o )</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” though A’Mo didn’t understand the compliment, he still said, “Xiaoyao, you’re as dashing as the Heavens!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha,” Ning Xiaoyao laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But A’Mo doesn’t understand,” A’Mo said, “Why doesn’t Windy say what happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned back to glance over at Shadowgale, who was still standing in front of the boudoir. “Could he say that a man was trying to get in while Fifth Young Miss was bathing? It’d completely ruin her reputation and finish her off for good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This world was very different from the apocalypse. The latter only concerned itself with survival and avoiding zombie bites. The former had its own standards and was too damned troublesome, in Ning Xiaoyao’s opinion. She sighed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yah,” A’Mo said, “Windy is a good guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao clicked her tongue. </span><i><span style>Was it as simple as just being a good guy? </span></i><span style>“That rogue, and the daughters who conspired the plot---are they all still here?” she asked A’Mo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The girls aren’t here, but the rogue is the one crouched way over in the back there,” A’Mo said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glanced at the area behind the Grand Preceptor’s men until she found the back row. Alright, even without asking for verification she could see a retainer crouched near the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s the one, there’s no mistake,” A’Mo was convinced of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And which daughters were involved? A’Mo, do you know?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eldest young Miss, third young Miss, fourth young Miss, sixth young Miss, and seventh young Miss and eighth young Miss,” A’Mo smoothly reported off the numbers. Ning Xiaoyao nodded as she listened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A’Mo asked, “Xiaoyao, what are you going to do now, ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although I don’t like Xie Duoying much,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “I hate people who ruin others out of jealousy even more. They’re all nothing but a pile of trash!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Looks like the Xie Clan daughters are doomed, </span></i><span style>A’Mo thought to himself. Ning Xiaoyao placed her hands behind her back and strode over the designated rogue. The man had no idea that Ning Xiaoyao already knew the truth, and simply knelt respectfully on the ground. Without a word, Ning Xiaoyao raised a leg and kicked him in his back, sending him sprawling in front of the Dragon Guards. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Capture him!” she cried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Dragon Guards had no idea what was going on, they still did as they were told. A few of them stepped forward and pressed the man against the ground. Shadowgale only looked at Ning Xiaoyao in astonishment. </span><i><span style>How did His Majesty find out what really happened?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao walked into the crowd of Dragon Guards before ordering, “Go and bring out the estate’s eldest young Miss, third young Miss, fourth young Miss, sixth young Miss, seventh young Miss, and eighth young Miss over here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the Dragon Guards gave Ning Xiaoyao a troubled look. “Your Majesty, this servant doesn’t know what they look like.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao muttered, “That’s true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A’Mo volunteered for the task. “I do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her nose before walking off to the side again. “But those brothers won’t understand what you’re saying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said A’Mo. </span><i><span style>That’s true. The only human who can talk to ants is probably Xiaoyao.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao surveyed the occupants of the courtyard. By now, Lady Wang had already been stunned by Ning Xiaoyao’s orders and was still lost in a daze. After Ning Xiaoyao finished scanning the courtyard, she walked to a teary-eyed servant girl with puffy red eyes. “Are you one of Xie Duoying’s people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, the little servant girl trembled. In her eyes, the Xie Clan’s masters were already terribly and frightening figures, to say nothing of the emperor himself. She didn’t even dare to think.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao half-crouched beside her and said, “I already know all about what happened to Xie Duoying. Do you want to seek justice for her sake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little servant girl looked up at Ning Xiaoyao. Ning Xiaoyao stuffed a sugar bean into her mouth and said, “It was my household’s Windy that saved your young Miss, oh. Little girl, you don’t want to see a perfectly good person framed either, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t,” the little servant girl replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then help lead the way for my people, won’t you?” Ning Xiaoyao said in a very soft voice. “Ill winds blow hard and peace is scarce in the Grand Preceptor’s estate. Have you considered moving to a different place to stay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The servant girl looked blankly at her. “Your Majesty wishes to take this servant away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you lead the way, I’ll bring you out of here,” Ning Xiaoyao said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little servant girl promptly nodded. Between a sovereign and his subjects, only a fool wouldn’t choose the emperor. Forget about telling an eight-year-old like her the intricacies of power plays, she wasn’t old enough to understand the finer details. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a deal,” Ning Xiaoyao pulled the little servant girl over to the Dragon Guards. “This little sister will lead the way. Capture anyone who refuses to show up and drag them here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With their problem solved, the Dragon Guards went off with the little servant girl. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” Shadowgale called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can stop talking,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “We’ll talk about your matters back at the palace. You still have a situation going on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale opened and closed his mouth a few times, at a loss for what to say. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, what are you doing?!” Lady Wang finally regained her wits and cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You two, go ask the Grand Preceptor to come,” Ning Xiaoyao instructed another pair of Dragon Guards. “Tell him there’s a war between women going on here, and we’re waiting for him to come see the show.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two Dragon Guards accepted the decree and left, while Lady Wang nearly howled in consternation. “</span><i><span style>Your Majesty!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s with all the yelling?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “In any case, I’m not summoning them to pick a concubine candidate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Wang had already lost most of her souls. </span><i><span style>Does this person want to ruin our Xie Clan daughters?! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“N-no, you can’t do that,” Lady Wang grew frantic. Somehow, she mustered up the courage to stand up and rush towards Ning Xiaoyao. Without any hint of manners, Ning Xiaoyao raised a hand and slapped Lady Wang on the face, knocking her senseless onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said the Dragon Guards. </span><i><span style>Actually, there’s no need for any of us, is there?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“None of you move,” Ning Xiaoyao told the stunned servants of the estate. “Anyone who does will end up just like her ladyship. This Majesty won’t show mercy to anyone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>None of the Grand Preceptor’s people had the guts to budge anymore. All of them were worrying over whether or not they’d live past today. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t that a little too much?” the Lord Protector asked Lou Zigui in a small voice. </span><i><span style>Raising a hand against a woman of the inner court, it’d be bad for His Majesty’s reputation if the news spread.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “Shadowgale wouldn’t show up in front of a young lady’s room without reason. His Majesty must have his reasons for such actions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said the Lord Protector. </span><i><span style>So you want to help His Majesty solve the Xie Clan’s domestic affairs?!</span></i></p>
