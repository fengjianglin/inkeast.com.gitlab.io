 <p>Chapter 29: Calling a conference of the first meeting&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn’t care about things like reputation. People during the apocalypse didn’t even know if they’d be bitten by a zombie one day. Surviving was hard enough, so reputation wasn’t worth anything. But right now, Ning Xiaoyao cared about Lou Zigui’s reputation very much. This person had fought, bled, and gotten injured for his country before being cursed as a traitor. </span><i><span style>For what? Just because he was friends with the crown prince? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn’t understand it, so of course she couldn’t take it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need to fear,” Ning Xiaoyao patted her chest as she promised Lou Zigui. “I’ll definitely help you get your innocence back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s injury didn’t hurt anymore, but his head did. He felt both tired and confused. Ning Xiaoyao raised a hand to rub Lou Zigui’s forehead. Her movements were too quick, so by the time Lou Zigui realized what was going down, her slender, thin fingers were already touching his skin. He narrowed his eyes. </span><i><span style>This person’s martial arts skills are quite advanced.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If you’re tired, then sleep,” Ning Xiaoyao poked his forehead as a soft green ball of light entered into his head. “Feel much better now?” she asked softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s gaze turned clueless again. Once more, he smelled the scent of grasses, trees, and a fresh meadow after rainfall. “You?” he asked Ning Xiaoyao doubtfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao withdrew her hand with a cheery grin. The faint scent lingering in the air quickly disappeared without a trace. Lou Zigui suddenly felt very reluctant to part with that fragrance. He lowered his head to stare at Ning Xiaoyao’s very fair, very skinny hand. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know martial arts?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn’t know whether Ning Yu had ever learned martial arts, but she didn’t care. “I’ve learned it. There’s still yummy seafood soup outside, you want some? I can bring some over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui didn’t get to talk before Ning Xiaoyao ran off. He sat on the low, narrow couch and looked at the door that had been closed again before suddenly recovering his senses. He wanted to talk to her about her female identity, but her ramblings had completely led him off track. Besides his first words at the start of their conversation, he hadn’t gotten to speak at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao ran into the corridors and was confused to see a full vat of scallop soup. Why wasn’t anyone drinking something so tasty? “None of you are drinking it?” Ning Xiaoyao asked Fang Tang and the rest, who were standing around. “If you’re not, I’ll take it to Supreme Commander.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Physician Gao was standing in the courtyard until he heard Ning Xiaoyao’s words and ran over. He didn’t even stop to pay his respects before crying out, “Your Majesty, the wounded can’t eat expanding foodstuffs like these scallops.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao was startled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They cannot,” Imperial Physician Gao said in a severe tone. Since he was brought over here with a sword to his neck, he had to take responsibility for these people. They’d incurred external wounds and still wanted to eat expanding food? Did they have a death wish?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wanted to say that Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>’</span></i><span style>s</span><i> </i><span style>wounds were just about healed, but she stopped on second thought. Would these people treat Supreme Commander</span> <span style>as a freak if he recovered from his injuries so quickly? </span><i><span style>(Author: Why don’t you consider whether others would treat you as a freak and roast you?)</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!” Imperial Physician Gao shouted towards Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She sighed. “Then forget it. Lil’ Big Bro Fang, go to the kitchens and find some other soups to bring over.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang obeyed and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you eating this?” Ning Xiaoyao asked Imperial Physician Gao, who shook his head. Right now, he didn’t want to eat anything. He just wanted to know what would happen to him in the future! A few generals shook their heads at Ning Xiaoyao as well. They weren’t in the mood to eat, either. Ning Xiaoyao placed the giant vat on her shoulders. If humans weren’t going to eat it, then the cats could.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... …” went all the people at the scene. This vat was even taller than His Majesty, but he’d just carried it away like that. </span><i><span style>Exactly how much strength did he have?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black and the rest saw Ning Xiaoyao coming out with a giant vat of scallops and jumped down from the Wutong tree in excitement. They surrounded Ning Xiaoyao with meows in a circle. Ning Xiaoyao found an empty patch of ground and ignored all formalities to pour out the soup as she said, “Eat up.” Then she raised the vat and drank down the rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faced with a delicious meal before him, Big Boss Black still didn’t forget to ask, “What about Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>?”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao put down the vat and said, “Fell asleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black lowered his head to eat the scallops on the ground, chewing and chewing until he suddenly remembered another thing with a shrill cry. “Isn’t Supreme Commander</span> <span style>poisoned?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... …” Ning Xiaoyao was speechless. So much for being a fanboy. It was already nighttime, but that chubby black dumpling had only remembered Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>’s </span></i><span style>poisoning now. Big Boss Black ran up to Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder and scratched her face with his paw. “Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>’s </span></i><span style>poison, Supreme Commander</span><span style>’s </span><span style>poison, Supreme Commander</span><span style>’s…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough, you,” Ning Xiaoyao tossed Big Boss Black into the air. “I’ve already treated Supreme Commander</span><span style>’s </span><span style>poison.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re a doctor?” said Little White, the long furred white cat. Ning Xiaoyao nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible,” an old sparrow called from the treetops. “You’ve only read a few books, and they were all taught by your old wet nurse! The Grand Preceptor wouldn’t have let you learn anything, chirp.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rolled her eyes and said, “I can even talk with you guys, so why can’t I be a doctor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little animals all looked at her with wide eyes. (⊙_⊙) These words seemed to make a lot of sense. Ning Xiaoyao looked down and saw, <em>hmm...</em>the weasels, badgers, a few hedgehogs, and various little animals she didn’t know had all arrived. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are you going to restore Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>’s </span></i><span style>innocence?” Big Boss Black asked as he ate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know,” Ning Xiaoyao replied truthfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandfather Sparrow,” Big Boss Black lifted his head to ask the old bird in the tree, “Can you steal the letters that hurt Supreme Commander</span> <span style>from that old Xie bastard’s house?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes lit up; this was a good idea! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandfather Sparrow shook his head. “I can’t lift it with my beak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... …” said Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Find a hawk!” a voice called from underfoot. Ning Xiaoyao glanced down and saw that even the ants had arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the use of those letters? How can we prove they were faked?” Yellow Great Immortal asked, his whiskers stained white with traces of soup. His words immediately showcased his superior intelligence quotient. Ning Xiaoyao’s expression turned bitter again. </span><i><span style>That’s right, we can’t run over and catch Modou from </span></i><em><span style>Northern </span></em><i><span style>Hu. </span></i><span style>How was she supposed to prove the letters were fake?</span></p>
 <p><span style>An unhappy Big Boss Black didn’t even want to eat scallops anymore. “Then is there no way? Miaow, you promised me, little Yu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt her hairs stand on end when Big Boss Black called her <em>‘little Yu.’</em> “What little Yu?” Ning Xiaoyao glared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty.” When asking favors from this human, Big Boss Black was an easy conversation partner and corrected himself easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My name is Ning Xiaoyao,” Ning Xiaoyao introduced herself to the little animals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But your name is Ning Yu,” a cat protested. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Ning Xiaoyao,” </span></i><span style>In terms of names, Ning Xiaoyao was very persistent. Anyone who wanted to could take an unlucky name like Ning Yu. She wasn’t going to use it even if she died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then Xiaoyao,” Big Boss Black gave a vicious scratch to the cat who interrupted and continued, “You promised me, you have to stick to your word!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao flopped onto the ground, extremely annoyed. “Yeah, I promised you. Give me some time to think it over, won’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a little grandson who told me Northern </span><i><span style>Hu</span></i><span style> sent a letter out of the capital yesterday,” Grandfather Sparrow spoke from his branch. “Supreme Commander'</span><span style>s</span><i> </i><span style>not dead, so they’re very unhappy, chirp.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao exhaled before sitting up again to peer at Grandfather Sparrow. “There are northern barbarians in the capital city too?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course there are!” all the animals chorused.</span><i><span style> Why didn’t this ninny know? That was being a little too stupid, wasn’t it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the front gardens, Shadowrain asked his senior, “Did His Majesty build a livestock shed in the flower gardens?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unhappy, Shadowgale said, “Do you need a shed to raise a cat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are birds chirping and cats meowing,” Shadowthunder added, “What else is there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Foxes?” a Dragon Guard guessed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone heard the loud noise of impact and nearly jumped. The next second, Ning Xiaoyao dashed out of the flower gardens in a frenzy as if she had just descended from the Heavens to appear in the corridor. She waved a hand at Shadowgale and the others and said, “Windy, Little Song, all of you come over. We’re holding a conference!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... …” said the generals and Dragon Guards. </span><i><span style>What was a conference?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the time it took half a stick of incense to burn, Ning Xiaoyao headed the start of the first conference meeting in a side hall of the palace. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The subject of our meeting today is to discuss how to restore Supreme Commander</span><span style>’s</span><i> </i><span style>innocence,” Ning Xiaoyao sat on a couch that was about the size of a bed, her face serious and solemn. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Tang had just sat down when he stood up again at Ning Xiaoyao’s words. “Your Majesty, you have a way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao motioned towards Fang Tang with a hand. “Sit down, we’ll talk properly if there are words to say. Don’t get excited.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The young General Fang could only sit down again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Cough cough,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao cleared her throat. “Right now, Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>’s </span></i><span style>asleep so we won’t wake him up. My original plan was to kill our way into Northern </span><i><span style>Hu</span></i><span style> territory and capture that shameless Modou.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Σ(△ °|︴, went everyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But Supreme Commander</span> <span style>said that was an impossible task,” Ning Xiaoyao continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... …” went everyone. </span><i><span style>Please don’t cause trouble, this really is something impossible.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Just now, I received news that the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu</span></i><span style> are very unsatisfied to see Supreme Commander</span> <span style>still alive. They’re extremely unhappy,” said Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dare I ask,” Song Jin spoke up, “From where did Your Majesty got such news?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After some thought, Ning Xiaoyao said resolutely, “My little pals are all very capable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, everyone suddenly felt that His Majesty had turned enigmatic and unfathomable. <em>Could it be that His Majesty had already trained up his own troops while staying at the Grand Preceptor’s estate? </em></span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at the gathered men and spoke. “I was thinking about it this way. If the Northern <em>Hu</em>&nbsp;wanted to kill Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>wouldn’t that prove he was innocent?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone gave a start before suddenly looking delight. </span><i><span style>That’s right! </span></i><span style>Song Jin took this moment to speak to the more experienced members. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if the Grand Preceptor accuses Supreme Commander</span> <span style>and Northern </span><i><span style>Hu</span></i><span style> of putting on a false show?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu</span></i><span style> show up to kill Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>it’ll prove they aren’t good people,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Meanwhile, we’ll take the chance to round up these northern barbarian secret...secret people, secret…” </span><i><span style>Dammit. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head. What did they call people who worked in espionage here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Secret agents,” Fang Tang reminded her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, right. Secret agents,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “We’ll seize the opportunity to capture all the secret agents. What kind of blockhead would put their life on the line to keep acting out a wretched plight ruse[1. </span><i><span style>wretched plight ruse </span></i><span style>(苦情计) - </span><i><span style>kuqingji, </span></i><span style>a probably play on words for </span><i><span style>self-injury ruse, </span></i><span style>or </span><i><span style>kurouji </span></i><span style>(苦肉计) strategy where one inflicts injury to oneself to win the confidence of the enemy.]?”</span></p>
