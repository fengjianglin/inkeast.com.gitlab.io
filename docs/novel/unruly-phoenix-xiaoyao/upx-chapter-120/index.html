 <p><span style>“I haven’t,” Qin Xuan shook his head empathetically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stopped glaring. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui glanced at the map. “The silver mines you’re talking about, can we extract the ores right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll need manpower and money,” Qin Xuan replied. “Moreover, moving the silver itself will be an issue after extraction.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui nodded and lowered his voice. “You’ll still need to be on guard against the official circles in Jiangnan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sat there completely ignorant. </span><i><span style>Why was there so much fuss involved with digging through a silver mine? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How much money do you need?” Lou Zigui asked next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s refugees in Jiangnan, so I can solve the manpower issue, but I can’t do anything about the money,” Qin Xuan said honestly. “After going against Xie Wenyuan, I have no hopes of getting any money from him to raise the Jiangnan navy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui asked, “How much did Xie Wenyuan used to give you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan held up five fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifth….fifty thousand?” Ning Xiaoyao asked weakly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan said, “Your Majesty, it wasn’t just to support the men, but the battleships as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then 500,000?” Ning Xiaoyao added an extra zero.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“5,000,000 taels,” Lou Zigui remarked. “Xie Wenyuan was certainly liberal with his money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, the Xie Clan wasn’t only raising the Jiangnan naval officers, but the entire navy. The annual cost was already 5,000,000 taels, a testament to the Xie Clan’s extreme wealth. Ning Xiaoyao almost couldn’t take the facts. Still, she was good at consoling herself and said, “Then General Qin, you won’t need the government to issue salaries, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Government?” Qin Xuan echoed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urk, I mean the imperial court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, this subject hasn’t seen silver from the imperial court in a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt that this was pretty nice. Grand Preceptor Xie had to raise the navy out of money from his own pockets. She had to give the old man a </span><i><span style>‘Like’ </span></i><span style>for that, and then maybe a banner or two as a gift. But upon further reflection, Ning Xiaoyao felt that something was off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned to Supreme Commander Lou and asked, “Then where’s the silver from the imperial court?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The palace didn’t even need to worry about feeding its navy and still allowed its refugees to die despite seeing them suffer.</span><i><span style> How could it be so poor? Where did the silver go?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “Xie Anyi’s the one in charge of the Ministry of Revenue, which overlooks all silver in the imperial court. Naturally, the Xie Clan took all of the money for themselves.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao fell silent. So in the end, the navy’s silver still came from the government after all? “5,000,000 taels?” she asked Qin Xuan again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>(ノ°Д°）ノ︵ ┻━┻ , went Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Regional Commander Qin watched Ning Xiaoyao leave after flipping the table, he didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry. Lou Zigui rested his forehead in his hands before he bent down to straighten up the table again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He told Qin Xuan, “His Majesty wants some peace and quiet. You can give me a rough estimate of how much money you need to excavate those mines, aside from the 5,000,000 taels to support the navy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And let His Majesty just leave like that?” Qin Xuan asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui was about to smooth out the wrinkled map when Qin Xuan’s words made him look up. “You want to persuade His Majesty yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan thought it over before looking down at the map again. It was hard enough talking to His Majesty, so how would he ever persuade him? </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao went to the flower gardens and raised her foot to kick the pear tree in front of her. But when she recalled how that must have cost money too, she used all her strength to kick a pebble near her foot instead. </span><i><span style>5,000,000 taels? Even if I sell myself, I can’t raise that much money!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>at the empress dowager’s palace had hung up her dance clothes to dry in the gardens. These silk dresses had been buried at the very bottom of the chest, so their water damage was slight at most. The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>figured that some time in the sun would restore them to their former state. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie held Ning Xin as she sat on the veranda, staring at the clothes hung up to dry. Her eyes were filled with nostalgia as she spoke to her child. “Those were given to imperial mother by Xin’er’s imperial father. Aren’t they pretty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The innocent and naive Ning Xin simply sucked on his thumb and babbled a few times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But imperial father’s not here anymore,” Empress Dowager Xie said as she grew saddened. She kissed Ning Xin on the cheek and said, “So Xin’er has to grow up quick. Only then can imperial mother and your grandfather stay alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this very moment, a dusty pebble fell down from the air and crashed into the clothesline pole. There was a loud crack before the pole split into two. A wind blew in from outside the gardens, whistling through the leaves like the crashing of ocean waves. Empress Dowager Xie’s resplendent dance clothes were caught up by the breeze and sent flying into the garden pond, where they soaked up the water before sinking to its depths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said the </span><i><span style>mama. </span></i><span style>Empress Dowager Xie slowly rose to her feet before she gave a shrill cry. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wahhhhh---!” Scared by the exclamation, Ning Xin started bawling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who threw that rock?!” Empress Dowager Xie screeched, on the edge of falling apart, again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>raised her head to look at the skies. They were a bright, clear blue and speckled with fluffy white clouds. She didn’t understand why a rock would suddenly fall out of the air. The eunuchs on duty ran out the courtyard to look around, but there was nobody there. They exchanged looks with each other before a cold chill ran down their backs. What a terribly fantastical event.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Empress Dowager!” Cries of alarm came from within the courtyard. The eunuchs hurried back in, only to see that the empress dowager had fainted again. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How are we supposed to live our lives from now on?</span></i><span style> Worry and anxiety pervaded the mood at the empress dowager’s palace. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stood in the gardens of Supreme Splendor Hall and rubbed her nose. She glanced at the building where Supreme Commander Lou and Regional Commander Qin were sitting. There was no way she could stand hearing about 5,000,000 taels again, so His Majesty Ning went to find comfort from her fellow womenfolk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong blocked Ning Xiaoyao at the entrance to Qin Xin’s quarters and rolled her eyes. “Your Majesty, elder sister Qin is a married woman. She can’t see outsider males.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stuck her head past her to peek into the room, only to see that someone had set up a screen in front of Qin Xin’s bed. “Do we have to be like this?” Ning Xiaoyao muttered. Ji Yuerong noticed Ning Xiaoyao’s look and silently told her that </span><i><span style>yes, it had to be this way.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Mute Nanny came from the room and paid respects to Ning Xiaoyao, before signing to say that Qin Xin’s luggage was all packed and done. Ning Xiaoyao thanked her before turning to Ji Yuerong. “You’re only paying attention to the fact that I’m a man? I’m also a doctor. If I don’t go in, how am I supposed to know how much Miss Qin’s recovered? I don’t know when I’ll see her again after today’s farewell. Are you going to take responsibility for your elder sister Qin’s health?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Ji Yuerong had no reason to hold Ning Xiaoyao back. Ning Xiaoyao strutted in with her chest held high. See who’d stop her from seeing Miss A’Xin now! (</span><i><span style>Author: Why do you insist on competing for such things….</span></i><span style>) Qin Xin was half reclining on the bed, all dressed for traveling. When she saw Ning Xiaoyao, her expression grew grateful as she attempted to rise and pay her respects. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need,” Ning Xiaoyao strode to her bedside with a grin. “Miss Qin, your complexion looks much better today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xin said, “This commoner thanks Your Majesty for saving my life. This commoner…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What ‘commoner’ business?” Ning Xiaoyao said as she sat on the stool by her bed. “You’re going to be Lady Qin soon, ah. The wife of the Regional Commander, how trendy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xin didn’t understand what ‘trendy’ meant, but she still smiled thankfully at Ning Xiaoyao. Ning Xiaoyao brushed her finger against Qin Xin’s right wrist, sending in a ball of pale green light as she remarked, “You’ve recovered quite well. After you get home, rest and recuperate well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong said, “Your Majesty, will elder sister Qin be able to walk again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Not only that, she’ll be able to have babies as well. Miss Qin, live a good life with Qin Xuan and let that jerk Xie Anyi go die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xin nodded. “Your Majesty, this commoner will forget about the Xie Clan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, forget them,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “They’re a bunch of bastards not worth remembering.” Ji Yuerong couldn’t approve more of Ning Xiaoyao’s words. In terms of Xie Anyi, they were on common grounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But don’t hate him too much,” Ning Xiaoyao added when she was done. “Because he and that little white flower definitely won’t live as well as you. He can’t be compared to General Qin, and that little white flower’s nothing compared to you. So Miss Qin, you just go on and be happy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xin smiled. “This commoner will remember Your Majesty’s words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. Trust in Your Majesty and find happiness, hahaha,” Ning Xiaoyao laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what Qin Xin’s worries were, Ning Xiaoyao’s teasing made her feel much better. Ji Yuerong was even more delighted. More and more, she found His Majesty quite congenial. No matter what he said or how foolishly he smiled, she was still fond of him. Next door, Qin Xuan paused in the middle of his hushed words with Lou Zigui. Just earlier, His Majesty had looked like the world was ending, but now he was laughing like this? More stifling was the fact that His Majesty had sought peace and quiet through a chat with his elder sister?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty has superb medical skills,” Lou Zigui explained on behalf of Ning Xiaoyao. “He must have felt that Miss Qin recovered greatly and congratulated her as a result.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan felt a bit better upon hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Qin Xin’s face was red, but she still kept her eyes on Ning Xiaoyao for her question. “Can this commoner’s body still get pregnant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded hastily. “You just need to nurture your body for it to recover. There’s no need to fear. You’ll have your share of babies and plenty of money--ah, geez.” Ning Xiaoyao suddenly recalled something at the mention of cash and leapt up from her stool. She ran out of the room as she cried, “I still have to tell General Qin something, talk to you later!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xin quietly asked Ji Yuerong, “Is His Majesty always like that? So hustling and bustling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong hemmed and hawed but didn’t reply. She wanted to say that His Majesty had always been a little insane, but it seemed greatly disrespectful to voice those words out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao dashed all the way to Qin Xuan and blurted, “General Qin, can you let me take over the Grand Preceptor’s smuggling business in Jiangnan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said Qin Xuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m really short of money,” Ning Xiaoyao said seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Half of it, maybe,” Lou Zigui spoke up. “I don’t think it’s possible to take over the entire venture.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan felt his head swell as he looked at the pair before him. He wasn’t the final say when it came to the seaports and official circles of Jiangnan. </span><i><span style>They shouldn’t pretend the Grand Preceptor had passed away already, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me borrow as much money as I need from you first,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “When I have money of my own, I’ll definitely pay you back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Xuan was stunned. </span><i><span style>His Majesty wants to borrow money from me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve got all of Prince Fu’s lands. There’s so many other vassal lords that I’ll definitely be able to scrounge up the case,” Ning Xiaoyao did her best to prove to Qin Xuan that she could pay back her loans.</span></p>
