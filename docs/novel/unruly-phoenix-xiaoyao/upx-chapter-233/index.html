 <p><span style>“Then fine, you can keep on being sick,” Ning Xia oyao bid farewell to Empress Dowager Xie before walking out of the room. Most of the residences in the palace were small rooms divided into inner and outer chambers. Ning Xiaoyao had just left the inner chambers to the room outside, where all of the court ladies and eunuchs were standing with their heads bowed. Some of them were even trembling in fright, making Ning Xiaoyao feel like she was some man-eating beast or a freak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” one of the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” As soon as Ning Xiaoyao spoke, everyone in the room fell to their knees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wiped her face before walking out, her heart feeling stifled. She was never welcome at the empress dowager’s palace. A </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>entered the room with Ning Xin in her arms just in time to meet eyes with His Majesty. She shivered in response before turning on her heel to flee. Ning Xiaoyao turned back to look at the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>who was escorting her out. The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>silently cursed the other </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>for bringing Prince Cheng here when His Majesty was visiting as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, t-that servant’s never seen your heavenly countenance before, so she lost her cool. This servant will call her back right away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it,” Ning Xiaoyao said coldly. “Could anyone who’s been assigned to take care of Ning Xin be someone who’s never seen my face? </span><i><span style>Mama, </span></i><span style>you’re trying to fool me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>instantly fell to her knees and cried repeatedly, “This servant deserves to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao only shook her head at the woman before descending the steps. </span><i><span style>What’s wrong with all the people in this palace? Am I a zombie or something? Why are they all so afraid of me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Ning Xiaoyao called to Shadowgale and the rest, who were all waiting in the courtyard. A few imperial physicians were still present as well. The one who’d last spoken to Ning Xiaoyao stepped forward with a bow to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, how is empress dowager’s illness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Empress Dowager’s worked plenty hard to catch a cold in the middle of summer,” Ning Xiaoyao remarked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The physician didn’t dare to continue the conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re supposed to say ‘Your Majesty is wise and brilliant,’” Ning Xiaoyao reminded him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The imperial physicians all stood with their heads bowed. If they praised His Majesty now, the empress dowager would skin them alive later!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just give her some pills or whatever,” Ning Xiaoyao told them. “It’s fine, no need to be nervous. Hard-working people rarely die so easily.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said the imperial physicians. They couldn’t say anything to that, either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao strode forward. While Empress Dowager Xie had been sighing, she’d taken the chance to brush her hand against the strands of the woman’s hair to check the state of her body. As it turned out, the woman really </span><i><span style>had </span></i><span style>made herself sick, a feat that Ning Xiaoyao could respect. For the sake of defeating her, Empress Dowager Xie had given her all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” Shadowgale called out at the sight of Ning Xiaoyao’s serious face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hm?” Ning Xiaoyao turned towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale pointed towards the left, where Ning Xiaoyao spotted two Dragon Guards holding the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>who had fled earlier in custody. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How does Your Majesty plan to deal with her?” Shadowgale asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She ran as soon as she saw me, what’s the crime for that?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Head Commander Shadowgale was quite ruthless with his reply. “Death penalty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s mouth twitched. “Don’t be like that, let’s be a little gentler.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Shadowgale and the Dragon Guards were silent. </span><i><span style>What does this have to do with being gentle?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao walked to the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>and stuck her head out to peer at Ning Xin in her arms. The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>instinctively shrank back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impudence!” Shadowgale scolded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>trembled again, while Ning Xin stopped playing with his finger to burst into tears at Shadowgale’s shout. Shadowgale gave a start after realizing he’d agitated the little Prince Cheng. Ning Xiaoyao reached out a hand to pinch Ning Xin’s face. His little nose and eyes, along with that wide-open mouth, really looked like an exact copy of the empress dowager. Ning Xin didn’t have many chances to see Ning Xiaoyao since he was born, so his cries only grew more mournful at the pinching. Those who didn’t know any better might even think Ning Xiaoyao was pinching the little prince hard on purpose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!” Very quickly, the “seriously ill” Empress Dowager Xie was drawn to the scene by the cries. When she saw Ning Xiaoyao touching her son, she couldn’t help but scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao withdrew her fingers, unimpressed. “He’s a boy, so why’s he crying at the mere sight of other people? Can’t he show a little more self-respect?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie nearly went mad at those words. “Don’t you touch him!” she shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao only shrugged. “You make it sound like I actually want to touch him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xin seemed to sense that Ning Xiaoyao was looking down on him, because his cries intensified. It sounded like he’d be out of breath at any minute. Empress Dowager Xie’s heart burned, but she didn’t dare to approach. In her mind, Ning Xiaoyao was the vilest of scoundrels. She was afraid that pushing her too far would make her act maliciously against Ning Xin instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He wasn’t good looking to begin with, but he’s even uglier when he cries,” Ning Xiaoyao tugged on her eyelids and stuck out her tongue at Ning Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wahhhhhhhh~” Ning Xin’s voice broke from all the wailing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!” Empress Dowager Xie shrieked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stopped making faces and glanced at the </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>who was looking at her like she’d seen a monster. She snorted and told Shadowgale and the rest, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Ning Xiaoyao and her people were gone, Empress Dowager Xie collapsed to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Empress Dowager!” her eunuchs and court ladies chorused at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie looked at her sobbing son, then at the daughter who didn’t spare a look back at the servants’ shouts of alarm. Her gaze shifted from shock and anger to resentment and hate. </span><i><span style>I’d like to see how long that damned girl can keep being so smug!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Pah!”</span></i><span style> Ning Xiaoyao spat at the gates to the empress dowager’s palace once she walked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale looked at the empress dowager’s twin gates and suddenly felt like he could read His Majesty’s mind. “Your Majesty thinks these gates are ugly?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao was only venting with her spit, but re-examined the gates upon being prodded. “They are pretty ugly, ha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Dragon Guards instantly understood that there was no keeping these two gates anymore. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I think the empress dowager’s whole house is pretty ugly too,” Ning Xiaoyao told the Dragon Guards. “Ghastly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale’s eyelid twitched. “But this servant doesn’t think there’ll be enough time to tear the whole thing down now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao furrowed her brows. “As if this is actually a problem of time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale felt that time wasn’t exactly the issue here, either. One Dragon Guard spoke up and asked, “Your Majesty, if the empress dowager’s palace is no more, where will she and Prince Cheng live?” </span><i><span style>One can’t just house the empress dowager wherever one pleases!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Ning Xiaoyao clapped her hands as she turned to Shadowgale. “Without the empress dowager’s palace, where will she and Ning Xin live? The Grand Preceptor’s estate? Heheh.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Too cruel~ </span></i><span style>All of the Dragon Guards and Shadowgale thought as they looked at Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>So His Majesty won’t even consider confining the empress dowager in the </span></i><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4danvs/what_was_exactly_the_cold_palace_%E5%86%B7%E5%AE%AB_in_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style>Cold Palace</span></i></a><i><span style>, because he wants to banish her and Prince Cheng outright!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao kicked at the gates a few times, then punched it with her fists. After her flurry of attacks, the two gates crashed to the ground with a loud </span><i><span style>bang. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Too ugly!” Ning Xiaoyao tossed these words at the dumbstruck servants of the empress dowager’s palace before leading her guards back to Supreme Splendor Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Empress Dowager Xie heard that her gates had been knocked down again, she didn’t even feel angry---or any need to get mad. </span><i><span style>That’s true, </span></i><span style>she mused as she hugged Ning Xin tightly to her chest, </span><i><span style>Why should I bother losing my temper at someone who’s sure to suffer a fate worse than death soon?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Everything will be fine soon,” Empress Dowager Xie murmured as she nuzzled against his cheer. “Xin’er don’t cry, our days will get better very soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back in Supreme Splendor Hall, Lou Zigui had just finished asking about the battle situation from the military officer. He was about to ask after Tao Yu when Ning Xiaoyao entered and yelled, “Supreme Commander, I’m back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui quickly stood up from his seat while the military officer hastily made to bow. Ning Xiaoyao waved a hand and said, “No need to stand on formalities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The officer couldn’t quite understand what Ning Xiaoyao meant. </span><i><span style>What formalities? It’s Your Majesty.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sit,” Lou Zigui told the officer. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So being allowed to sit means not standing on formalities? </span></i><span style>The young officer felt he needed more brainpower to figure all this out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here.” Ning Xiaoyao carried over two plates of snacks to the tea table by the officer’s chair. After some thought, she moved over the tea things by Lou Zigui’s side as well and said, “Eat up, we’ve got plenty of snacks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The officer was frightened by Ning Xiaoyao’s familiarity. He blankly took a pastry and opened his mouth to take a bite, not tasting a bit of it. All he knew was that His Majesty was personally treating him to desserts in Supreme Splendor Hall!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is Esteemed Empress Dowager’s condition?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao walked to his side and remarked, “Not serious. She froze herself until she got sick.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui quickly darted a glanced at the dazed officer munching on his snack. Ning Xiaoyao got the message and lowered her voice. “Ah, that’s right. You can’t air private scandals in public.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>It’s not a good habit to be so blunt with your speech, either.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The gates to the empress dowager’s palace were too ugly,” Ning Xiaoyao added. “So I helped the empress dowager fix them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you do?” Lou Zigui regretted the words as soon as he spoke them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao laughed. “I helped her take the doors down. Now she can put up new ones in their place.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Pfft!” </span></i><span style>On one side, the officer spat out the pieces of pastry in his mouth. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at him and said, “Hurry up and drink some water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The officer poured himself a drink and drained the cup. Lou Zigui looked at him and realized the fellow was more simple-minded than he saw at first glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That there, is General Tao doing well?” Ning Xiaoyao ran in front of the officer and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My general’s doing pretty well,” the officer replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good then,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Go visit your general’s wife and young Miss later, tell them a bit about what General Tao’s been doing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” the officer obeyed immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there enough money?” Ning Xiaoyao asked as she lowered her voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough,” the officer nodded. “Prince Fu has money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough grain to eat?” Ning Xiaoyao asked next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough, Prince Fu has grain,” the officer replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Ning Xiaoyao looked at him. “Then who’s the good guy here, Prince Fu or Your Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty is good!” the officer blurted without a second thought. “Without Your Majesty, that prince wouldn’t have given us any money or food!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s your name?” Ning Xiaoyao asked as she patted the man on the shoulder. “Let’s be friends.”</span></p>
