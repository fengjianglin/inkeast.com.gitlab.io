 <p><span style>“I still don’t understand,” Ning Xiaoyao said after sitting there, thinking for awhile. “You say that Xie Anyi only married your big sister Qin for the sake of the Qin Clan’s navy. Then you say she’s the only member of the Qin Clan left. So after she married into the Xie Clan, the navy became the Xie Clan’s navy as well?” She never heard of a woman marrying with an entire army as her dowry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong gnashed her teeth in hatred. “The current commander of the navy is one of the Qin uncle’s foster sons. With big sister Qin in the Xie Clan’s hands, he doesn’t dare disobey their words!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scoundrels!” Ning Xiaoyao cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Anyi is a bastard!” Ji Yuerong swore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right!” Ning Xiaoyao slapped the table. Old General Ji sat to one side drinking his tea. Right now, he had no desire to say a word. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong looked at Ning Xiaoyao and said, “Your Majesty, will your help my big sister Qin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll help,” Ning Xiaoyao decided right then and there. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The pleasant surprise had come so suddenly, and without any warning, that Miss Ji found herself hardly able to believe it. For the sake of her big sister Qin, Chief Commander Qin Xuan[1. </span><i><span style>Qin Xuan </span></i><span style>(秦轩) - </span><i><span style>Qin </span></i><span style>is a surname (and yes, it’s the same Qin in Duke of Qin from </span><a href="http://volarenovels.com/poison-genius-consort/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style>Poison Genius Consort</span></i></a><i><span style>). Xuan </span></i><span style>means “high, lofty,” it also used to refer to a high-fronted, curtained carriage or a window/door.] had submitted a written petition to the late emperor five times. However, Emperor Yuanzong ignored him the first four times before denouncing him for the fifth. Even the </span><i><span style>qingliu--</span></i><span style>the clear stream faction of scholars who prided themselves on staying aloof from politics--had said that it was only right for a married woman to look after her husband and his children. How could anyone ask them to annul their relationship when the husband had done no wrong? A single sentence like that blocked off all exits for the young Miss of the Qin Clan. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But now, </span></i><span style>Ji Yuerong thought as she looked at Ning Xiaoyao with tear-filled eyes, </span><i><span style>Now this little emperor says he’ll help?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sounds like you’re on really good terms with this big sister from the Qin clan,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she poured Ji Yuerong a cup of tea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This soldier’s known her since childhood,” Ji Yuerong replied. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao nodded. </span><i><span style>Those two must be best friends.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty’s really going to help that gal from the Qin Clan?” Ji Jiu asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m helping. Why wouldn’t I?” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Xie Anyi, that jerk. He didn’t marry that girl, he kidnapped her and held her hostage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because of Lou Zigui, Ji Yuerong had a bad impression of Ning Xiaoyao before she even met her. But with that single sentence, Ji Yuerong found herself willing to defend the borders and open up new frontiers all for his sake, as a subject should do. Ji Jiu found himself anticipating Ning Xiaoyao’s deeds as well. Still, the old general didn’t say much. Actions spoke louder than words, so he wanted to see just how His Majesty would keep his word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their dishes arrived then, so Ning Xiaoyao used the duration of their meal to learn all about the Qin Clan girl, A’Xin[2. </span><i><span style>A’Xin </span></i><span style>(阿欣) - a nickname in which </span><i><span style>Xin </span></i><span style>means “happiness.”] and other information on the Xie Clan wives. Ning Xiaoyao even found out that Xie Anyi had never stepped foot into Miss Qin’s rooms after they were married. (</span><i><span style>Author: Imagine how the old general must have felt, listening to those two talk. </span></i><span style>囧)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem,” Ning Xiaoyao guaranteed to Ji Yuerong. “I’ll make sure Miss Qin finds a good man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong shook her head. “How could big sister Qin marry anyone else now?” Even if she left him, her namesake would be ruined. Who would want her then? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao scooted closer to Ji Yuerong and said, “I’ve got a lot of Dragon Guards under my command. More importantly, they’re all bachelors.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong’s chopsticks slipped out of her hands to clatter on the table. </span><i><span style>She hasn’t even left him yet and he’s already found her a match?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Shadowgale won’t do,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “He already has Little Peach Blossom. But she’s free to choose amongst the others.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Shadowgale, who was standing right outside the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s Little Peach Blossom?” Ji Yuerong asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Peach Blossom is--wait a sec,” Ning Xiaoyao’s brain suddenly clicked into place. “That Qin Xuan guy, has he gotten married yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong shook her head. “No. My paternal grandfather’s helped him find some matches, but he wasn’t interested in any of those girls.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His Majesty Ning arched an eyebrow before she instantly understood. It wasn’t that Qin Xuan didn’t like the girls offered to him, but that the person in his heart was none other than A’Xin. All these years, he’d willingly allowed Xie Anyi and his father to bully him for the sake of Miss Qin. </span><i><span style>Oh my God. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao praised herself for her astute reasoning. Then she mentally lit a candle in honor of her Dragon Guards. </span><i><span style>Brothers, continue on with your single lives.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Old General Ji suddenly spoke up, “Three days later, Qin Xuan will return to the capital to report on his work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes lit up. “He’s coming too, huh. Alright, I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Old General Ji. </span><i><span style>What did you understand?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Eat up,” Ning Xiaoyao told the Ji grandfather and granddaughter. “Money was spent on this food. It’ll be a shame if we don’t finish it all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old General Ji was preoccupied with his thoughts as he ate his meal. By the time he finished and was on the way back to the post house with his granddaughter, Ji Yuerong actually said that His Majesty was a good person. That gave the old general a start. A single meal had been enough for His Majesty to subdue his stubborn grandchild. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The little emperor certainly has skills, </span></i><span style>Old General Ji thought as he regarded Ning Xiaoyao in a new light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That A’Xin,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she left the Drunken Immortal restaurant for the streets. “I was originally planning to pair her up with Second Thunder. But later on I realized that it was hopeless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale walked in silence with Ning Xiaoyao for awhile before he suddenly said, “Your Majesty, you’ll really let we humble servants take wives?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why shouldn’t I?” Ning Xiaoyao said. She might be doomed to crossdress in this life, but was she really going to drag 300 or so Dragon Guards to stay single like her as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The rules of the imperial clan…” Shadowgale started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right now, I’m the emperor,” Ning Xiaoyao cut him off as she patted her chest. “So what I say goes. Another day, I’ll help inspect Little Peach Blossom for you. If she’s a good girl, you shouldn’t miss out on your chance, understood?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately, Shadowgale turned tense before scratching nervously at his ears and cheeks. Ning Xiaoyao kept her eyes straight ahead. Shadowgale acting like this really was a blow to his image. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Send some people to watch over the city gates. Old Gramps Ji said that the Jiangnan navy’s Qin Xuan will be arriving three days from now. We’ll need to whisk him into the palace first thing. I have words to say to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That person’s part of the Grand Preceptor’s faction,” Shadowgale reminded Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wouldn’t have any of it. “I’ll just talk to him first. That’s right, what’s it mean to annul a relationship?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Shadowgale. </span><i><span style>After all that, you still don’t know what it means? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t know, either?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And thus, the Head Commander of the Dragon Guards had to explain the concept of annulling a relationship to Ning Xiaoyao. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So annulling a relationship means to have a divorce. </span></i><span style>Now that Ning Xiaoyao understood, she clicked her tongue and said, “And here I was thinking it was something difficult.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale said, “Your Majesty, </span><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/nee" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>née</span></a><span style> Qin is stuck in the Grand Preceptor’s estate with no way to get out. How are you planning to have her annul her relationship with the eldest Xie son?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn’t think twice before she spoke. “Then I’ll just have to go to the Grand Preceptor’s estate again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does Your Majesty know where née Qin lives?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do,” Ning Xiaoyao had thought it all out, because Wifey Magpie’s elder male cousin lived at the Grand Preceptor’s estate. Shadowgale thought it over and thought it made sense. His Majesty had grown up at the Grand Preceptor’s estate, so it was possible he knew where née Qin lived. Ning Xiaoyao tapped her foot and looked ahead before suddenly darting into the crowd. The next thing she did was stop in front of a red horse with her arms open. By the time Lou Zigui moved to pull on his reins, Little Red had already come to a stop. He stuck out his tongue and licked Ning Xiaoyao’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao held Little Red’s head and nuzzled against his face. “Hello, Little Red.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale glanced at Lou Zigui as he got off his horse. He couldn’t take a name like that. </span><i><span style>How did His Excellency Supreme Commander come up with it? </span></i><span style>Meanwhile, Lou Zigui was staring at the snow wolf pup sticking its head out of Shadowgale’s collar. </span><i><span style>That wolf really is pretty fat…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s Prince Zhi doing?” Ning Xiaoyao asked after her snuzzle session with Little Red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui led Ning Xiaoyao to walk ahead while Shadowgale followed behind them with the horse. “The imperial clansmen think that the Grand Preceptor wants to kill them,” Lou Zigui murmured softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s foot nearly slipped as she walked. Had something major happened while she was treating someone out to eat?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They think Your Majesty is the head of the assassins,” Lou Zigui added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh,” Ning Xiaoyao considered the name. “Head of the assassins, that sounds pretty powerful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did Your Majesty go to Prince Zhi’s estate?” Supreme Commander Lou asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For money, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Isn’t he having a private affair with the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu? </span></i><span style>I think he has to have money, so I wanted to get some for myself.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>For money. </span></i><span style>These words echoed in Supreme Commander Lou’s head for a long time. Compared to naming his horse ‘Little Red,’ Lou Zigui found it harder to accept this fact. </span><i><span style>How could she have only gone for money?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I wasn’t planning to kill anyone at all. I just wanted to settle things with that money grubbing guy,” Ning Xiaoyao explained seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Momentarily speechless, Lou Zigui could only lift his hand and pat Ning Xiaoyao on the head. After a long while, he said, “It’s a private business deal, not private affair.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glanced at a meatbun shop they just passed by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to eat some?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale was quick to interject, “Supreme Commander, His Majesty’s just eaten a meal.” </span><i><span style>He can’t eat any more. What if he hurts his digestive system?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty’s ate a meal?” Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao away from the shop. If that was the case, she really couldn’t eat any more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I ate at the Drunken Immortal,” Ning Xiaoyao said. She was always happy when the topic was about food. “I treated old man Ji and Yuerong to a meal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s steps faltered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I promised Yuerong too,” Ning Xiaoyao continued, “That I’d help A’Xin annul her relationship. Xie Anyi, that jerk. I spit on him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was too much information overload here, so Supreme Commander Lou felt like he needed more time to process everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, that’s right,” Ning Xiaoyao added, “Windy and I and the rest also captured a woman the Grand Preceptor was raising outside his estate. That woman hurt Little Tangerine. She’s a jerk too, I spit on her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was too much information overload </span><i><span style>there </span></i><span style>too. Lou Zigui looked at Shadowgale and asked, “What happened?” He felt like His Majesty had accomplished a lot while he was drinking tea with the imperial clansmen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale didn’t get to speak before Ning Xiaoyao tugged at Lou Zigui and looked at the left side of the street. “Supreme Commander, the egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>from that stall is really tasty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aroo~” the wolf pup howled in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Lou Zigui was thinking of </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>instead. “Then I’ll buy some more so Your Majesty can take it back to the palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no more, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao said regretfully. “The boss used up all the duck eggs he had. He’ll have to wait ‘til next month to make egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui fell silent. </span><i><span style>You can even find out those things while eating guoba?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuerong and I are pals now,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she stared at the food stall, reminiscing over the delicious flavor of </span><i><span style>guoba. </span></i><span style>“I’m planning to talk with Qin Xuan once he arrives at the capital city. Mm, if he’s a good guy and A’Xin doesn’t mind, I’ll have them be husband and wife. Supreme Commander, you think that’ll work?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>I don’t think I’m the one who decides that.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I think it’s a pretty good arrangement,” Ning Xiaoyao’s head bobbed cheerfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was only one thought in Lou Zigui’s mind at the moment: </span><i><span style>As long as you’re happy…</span></i></p>
