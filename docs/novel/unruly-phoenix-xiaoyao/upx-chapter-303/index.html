 <p><span style>Chapter 303: Supreme Commander says, Xie Wenyuan is dead</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sat inside the main chamber of the Supreme Splendor Hall. At this location, the sounds of fighting and killing over the palace entrance were especially resounding to her ears. Big Boss Black and Little White Fatty accompanied Ning Xiaoyao as they laid on the couch. These two had always been making fusses, but at the moment, they both kept quiet and didn’t even dare to breathe out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar scuttled into the main chamber alongside a little mouse whose size was approximately its own. Hopping onto Ning Xiaoyao’s lap, Oil Jar softly squeaked, “Xiaoyao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed Oil Jar's head before turning to look at the little mouse in front of the couch, “Oil Cake, why did you come here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Cake didn’t meet with Ning Xiaoyao as frequently as Oil Jar, and was thrilled that Ning Xiaoyao still recognized him. Pancake gave her two happy squeaks before informing, “Xiaoyao, I was in the Hall of Punishment just now. I saw First Young Master Ning kill Second Prince!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao (￣△￣；), </span><i><span style>what is her Big Bro Ning scheming?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“And then your Windy came as well, Xiaoyao,” Oil Cake continued, “He came on Supreme Commander’s order to kill Second Prince, </span><i><span style>squeak</span></i><span style>~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wiped her face in nonplus, “So they all want to kill Second Prince. Why, ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Cake was unable answer this question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao asked, “Are the other princes still alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want those four dead too?” Big Boss Black chimed in, “I’ll take Little White Fatty and bite them to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Arooo!” Little White Fatty stood up from his originally lying position and nodded towards Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go your butt,” Ning Xiaoyao patted them into lying back down on their stomachs. “Don’t cause trouble.” </span><i><span style>Why would she want to kill them for no reason?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Little Gyrfalcon glided through a window into the main chamber. He perched on the armrest of the couch and said to Ning Xiaoyao, “Xiaoyao, no need to fear the cannons. First Young Master Ning has led men and killed their way out of the palace. They even toppled the crates those rebel troops use to contain cannonballs! My master said, the gunpowder is soaked and can’t hurt people, </span><i><span style>arooo</span></i><span style>!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First Young Master Ning is </span><i><span style>so</span></i><span style> formidable!” Oil Jar exclaimed with emotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander is the </span><i><span style>most</span></i><span style> formidable!” Big Boss Black shrieked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao, who do you think is more formidable?” Little White Fatty asked Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enemy may be at the gates, but Ning Xiaoyao still pondered seriously over this senseless issue. Eventually, she replied, “Dunno, I must see them duel before I can decide.” Speaking of which, Ning Xiaoyao picked up her short sword on the bed and placed it on her knees. “I think that </span><i><span style>I’m </span></i><span style>very formidable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The short sword was the smallest type of</span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-ab&amp;q=%E9%9B%81%E7%BF%8E%E5%88%80" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style>Yanling Sword</span></a><span style>. Lou Zigui had especially sought it out so Ning Xiaoyao would have a proper weapon to fight the enemies. After all, a sword was far more destructive compared to a brick. Ning Xiaoyao flicked lightly on the golden-coated scabbard and told her little animal pals, “This thing is pretty valuable. If the enemies fight their way into this place later, you guys help me watch over this scabbard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re gonna fight enemies, and you’re worried about a scabbard?” By now, Big Boss Black believed Ning Xiaoyao was a thorough ninny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao grabbed Little White Fatty and carried him to the ceiling rafters. She turned to call Big Boss Black, Oil Jar and the rest, “Come up here, y’all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cat and mice were experts at climbing, and there was no need to question Little Gyrfalcon. In an instant, the four got onto the ceiling rafters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao placed the scabbard on the rafters and instructed the little animals, “You guys stay up here and help me look after this. Do not come down under any circumstances. Even if you see me being hacked at, you’re not allowed to appear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao?” Oil Jar felt something very wrong with Ning Xiaoyao’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Listen and behave.” Ning Xiaoyao patted all the heads of all five little animals before jumping off the ceiling rafters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-----</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Return to the palace!” First Young Master Ning ordered loudly. He had been killing enemies and dragging the battlefield everywhere around the palace entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the end of the long street, a rebel team on horseback charged towards the palace entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Archers!” Lord Protector shouted from the city gate tower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The archers stationing at the small apertures on the tower raised their bows and drew arrows. The heavy rain had no effects on their thick callused hands. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing at the corridor of the main chamber, Ning Xiaoyao could hear the sounds of arrows ripping through the air over at the palace entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Gyrfalcon flew to perch on Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder. He remained silent and only nuzzled Ning Xiaoyao’s face with his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you can’t bear to stay still on the rafters, lil falcon, go help me find Supreme Commander.” Ning Xiaoyao said, “I had Wheat follow Supreme Commander, but Wheat hadn’t come back to find me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Gyrfalcon confirmed, “You want me to check if Supreme Commander is okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go see if he has captured Grand Preceptor.” Ning Xiaoyao replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, alright, I understand.” Little Gyrfalcon spread his wings and flew to the sky.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Grand Preceptor must be captured!</span></i><span style> Ning Xiaoyao covered her ears. </span><i><span style>Or else, all these people would’ve died for nothing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>On the road leading outside from the city’s west end, Lou Zigui was leading at the very front of a cavalry troop when he suddenly stopped his horse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Mu went up to greet and nodded at Lou Zigui. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui got off his horse and strode to a horse carriage. An individual was kneeling in front of the horse carriage. Shen Mu stepped forward and raised a leg to kick this person to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man sprawled on the ground. He didn’t beg for mercy and just lay there in a dull, hopeless manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui pressed a hand on his sword handle as he gazed silently at this individual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man looked about the same age as Grand Preceptor Xie, his physique was similar as well. Even his facial shape and features bore some resemblance to Grand Preceptor Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was raining and we were too far apart,” Shen Mu bitterly explained, “We thought that this was Xie Wenyuan, but this one is a f**king doppelganger!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui scanned the other bodies on the ground. These people were all Xie Wenyuan’s bodyguards. For years, they had been trained as his trusted aides. Yet, Xie Wenyuan just used them as disposables. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander, do we keep giving pursue?” Shen Mu asked with burning anxiety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui muttered, “Xie Wenyuan isn’t capable of moving any faster than this doppelganger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, then that old thing isn’t at the west gate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Most likely not.” Lou Zigui turned to look at the doppelganger on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The body double had been lying there unmoved, his eyes wide open to gaze at the sky. He was pretending as if he was already dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Mu glanced behind Lou Zigui when he heard the sounds of horse hooves. &nbsp;He whispered, “General Xu has arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Jing got off his horse when he arrived at the vicinity. He strode toward Lou Zigui and asked about the situation while he examined the doppelganger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He fled.” Lou Zigui spoke in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Jing’s face became ashen as he looked at the body double on the ground. His original plan was to stay by Grand Preceptor Xie’s side and act as a mole. After an abrupt turn of circumstances, however, Grand Preceptor Xie had failed to confirm the emperor’s death and fled the capital. Warfare instantly followed, so they had to give up on the spy plan. Since Xie Wenyuan failed to find a reason for his revolt and the rebel troops grew irresolute, they could take advantage of this beneficial situation to make a move against Grand Preceptor’s forces. But now that Xie Wenyuan had escaped, General Xu was trepidatious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are currently tens of thousands of troops fighting each other to their death,” Lou Zigui analyzed, “Furthermore, there are many common people who have taken refuge outside the capital. If Xie Wenyuan disguises himself and blends among those people, it’d be an arduous task to find him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, do we stop searching?” Xu Jing glared at Lou Zigui. “You know the consequences if we let Xie Wenyuan off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know,” Lou Zigui said in a low voice, “It’s useless to get angry now. Uncle, you should calm down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>General Xu stood and let the rain shower him for a while. Then, he pointed at the doppelganger, “Who is this person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have troops stationed at the south, north and east roads of the city.” Lou Zigui didn’t care the least bit about the doppelganger’s identity. He muttered to Xu Jing, “Even if we can’t find Xie Wenyuan, it doesn’t mean he can escape his doom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Jing gazed at Lou Zigui. The latter was looking like his usual self, there wasn’t a trace of worry on his expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill him.” Lou Zigui ordered Shen Mu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Mu was briefly stunned. When he regained his wits, his sword slashed down and chopped off the doppelganger’s head. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood gushed out from the doppelganger’s headless neck, creating a fountain of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take the head of this man and these bodyguards and hang them at all four city gates in turns.” Lou Zigui gave out an order, “Xie Wenyuan is dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Mu cast a glance at the head he was holding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Jing gave a start before he finally followed up, “That’s right. This is Xie Wenyuan’s head!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Once the rebel troops hears that Xie Wenyuan is dead, how many of them would still have the heart to risk their lives in the capital? If Xie Wenyuan doesn’t want to lose, he would have to personally reveal himself prove that he wasn’t dead. Then, they will be able to locate that old thing right away.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Two birds one stone.” General Xu gave a pat on Lou Zigui’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blockhead.” Lou Zigui called out Shen Mu’s nickname.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Mu hastened to instruct the soldiers to work and cut off every single head from the bodyguards’ corpses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An hour later, news of Grand Preceptor Xie’s death on the west road had spread all over the capital city and its suburbs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a small farm on the city’s eastern suburb, a guard ran to a courtyard entrance and knelt on the steps. He called out to the person standing inside the corridor, “Grand Preceptor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie was currently dressed in a common landlord robe, a bandana wrapped around his head. The man who could call for wind and summon the rain at the imperial court now looked like any usual country scholar -the type that stayed at home to play with their grandchildren and passed their days in peace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Yiming was standing next to Grand Preceptor Xie. He asked, “How is the situation outside?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guard reported, “Lou Zigui has ordered his man to carry around a man’s head. H-he said that Grand Preceptor is d-dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie waved his sleeve to dismiss the guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the guard withdrew from the courtyard, Xu Yiming anxiously exclaimed, “Grand Preceptor, it’s either we stay or leave. You must make a decision!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If we leave, then the tens of thousands of troops will be massacred.” Grand Preceptor Xie said. “If we stay, this old man and Ning Yu might still be able to have a battle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then your decision is?” Xu Yiming asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie pushed lightly on the birdcage hanging over the corridor. Inside the cage, the yellow canary flapped its wings and chirped loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grand Preceptor, there isn’t much time left.” Xu Yiming urged Grand Preceptor Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie stretched his hand to play with the caged yellow canary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Yiming could only worry as he didn’t dare to urge Grand Preceptor Xie for the second time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, another guard ran to the courtyard and knelt on the steps. He reported to Grand Preceptor Xie, “Grand Preceptor, there is news from the capital that His Highness Second Prince had passed away. The head commander of the Dragon Guards Shadowrain led men to Second Prince’s estate. Later on, news spread from the capital that Grand Preceptor, Grand Preceptor was the one who ordered everyone to be massacred in Second Prince’s estate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie’s finger slided down from the silver birdcage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guard didn’t dare to look at his master. He talked with his head hanging down, “Many people from Second Prince’s side have died as well. It has been spread that Grand Preceptor sent men to murder them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ning Huo, that useless trash!” Grand Preceptor Xie cursed in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Yiming’s face was as pale as a sheet of paper now. He whispered, “Does His Majesty already know of Grand Preceptor and Second Prince’s arrangement to take over the throne?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This old man placed the siege cannons inside Second Prince’s estate.” Grand Preceptor Xie’s tone was chilling, “Now, it seems it was all in vain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Yiming was shocked as he gazed at his master. </span><i><span style>Siege cannons?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Grand Preceptor’s estate will definitely be searched,” Grand Preceptor Xie crossed hands behind his back. “Ning Yu won’t let off this old man’s followers either. On the outside, this old man and Ning Huo never had any contact with each other. We even appear to be enemies since we both want the throne. It should have been okay to hide the siege cannons inside Ning Huo’s estate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Yiming was taken aback for a long moment. In the end, he said, “Then how did His Majesty know that Second Prince…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie raised his hand to stop Xu Yiming’s speech. </span><i><span style>He had communicated everything through paper and not speech. How did Ning Yu find out about his plan? Just where did it go wrong?!</span></i></p>
