 <p><span style>“Then what do you plan to do with Lil Big Bro Song’s big brother?” Ning Xiaoyao asked Lou Zigui as they headed for Supreme Splendor Hall. “Just what happened? Do you know, Supreme Commander?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now isn’t the time to worry about that,” Lou Zigui murmured. “After we deal with the consequences, we’ll look into the cause.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought over his words. “That makes sense. But Supreme Commander, aren’t you even a little bit curious about it all?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now isn’t the time to interrogate Song Xu,” Lou Zigui replied. “He’s still useful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was very disappointed. “So it’s like that, ah. I wanted to go beat him up, too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui laughed and pinched her cheek. “I suspect that news of Fang Tang ‘getting into trouble’ should have spread by now. I’d like to see Xie Wenyuan’s reaction.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor’s reaction?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm.” As the path before them turned, sunlight shifted to shine on Ning Xiaoyao instead. Lou Zigui stepped to her left to shield her from its rays before he murmured, “Later I’ll tell Song Xu that Fang Tang’s unharmed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And then?” Ning Xiaoyao didn’t understand his intentions. “How will the Grand Preceptor react to that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you have eyes and ears in the Grand Preceptor’s estate?” Lou Zigui turned to look at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urk, yes,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded. She had lots of little pals there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keep an eye on Xie Wenyuan,” Lou Zigui said. “If he sends anyone to Anyuan, then it’ll prove that Fang Tang really is unharmed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao nodded. </span><i><span style>Am I missing some brain cells or something? I never understand Supreme Commander’s words. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If Grand Preceptor Xie’s still sending men to Anyuan at a time like this, then it’ll be to check whether the Black Frost Cavalry’s really made their way to the capital. This would mean that Fang Tang never fell into their hands,” Lou Zigui explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned over the words in her mind before she sputtered, “But what if the Grand Preceptor’s just putting on another show to trick us again? He knows you’ll reason like that, Supreme Commander, so he’ll follow your train of thought to lower your guard against him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He doesn’t know </span><i><span style>we </span></i><span style>already know that Song Xu’s betrayed us, so why would he put on an unnecessary show?” Lou Zigui smiled. “Moreover, with your little pals keeping an eye on him, we’ll know everything he says and does. Why should I be afraid of him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even my little pals didn’t know about Song Xu,” Ning Xiaoyao knitted her brows. </span><i><span style>How did the Grand Preceptor manage to hide that from an estate full of animals? I’ll need to investigate this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“So please have them put in extra effort this time,” Lou Zigui stopped, brushing aside the willow tree branches that had come to rest against Ning Xiaoyao’s head. “Xiaoyao, we can’t afford to make any more mistakes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Fang Tang’s untouched, then doesn’t that mean the Black Frost Cavalry still has a chance of showing up?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui gave a bitter laugh. “There’s the possibility, but we can’t rely on them now. If we gamble all our prospects on Fang Tang and lose, then I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rested a hand over Lou Zigui’s mouth. “Then we won’t do that.” She didn’t like it when he looked so hopeless. </span><i><span style>Supreme Commander Lou should never be like that.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui nodded and shifted his gaze to look ahead. Only then did Ning Xiaoyao realized they were standing in front of a large lake. Five or six wild ducks were currently swimming in its waters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao,” one of the ducks quickly headed towards her. Ning Xiaoyao knew this one--it was Fivehue, who liked to chat with her back at Supreme Splendor Hall. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui saw the duck come closer and brushed his sleeve, where he’d hidden some darts. “Do you want to eat wild duck?” Miss Ning was a foodie, so he wanted to do something to make her happy as compensation for such a big failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao froze with her hand half raised in the air. She was going to toss some food to Fivehue, but now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Quack?” Fivehue turned blank at Lou Zigui’s words before he cried out. “The idiot who can’t even beat the Grand Preceptor wants to eat us, quack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>o(╯□╰)o, went Ning Xiaoyao. The other ducks heard Fivehue’s cry and all flew into the air. Lou Zigui felt a hint of regret. He hadn’t even raised his hand, much less attack a duck. Ning Xiaoyao turned to look at him. “Do you feel like even the ducks are bullying you now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui was feeling sorry because the ducks had flown, but her words turned his face black.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be like that,” Ning Xiaoyao patted his chest. “This time I’ll definitely keep an eye on the Grand Preceptor. No worries, Supreme Commander. With me here, no one can pick on you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stared down at Ning Xiaoyao’s petite form and sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll grow,” Ning Xiaoyao said seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rested a hand against his forehead. “Whether or not you grow, I’ll still like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll definitely grow,” Ning Xiaoyao insisted. Once she dealt with the Grand Preceptor and had easier days ahead, she’ll definitely grow, both in height and her you-know-what size!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui could only nod. “Yes, you’ll grow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t like to eat duck,” Ning Xiaoyao added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are even things you don’t like to eat?” Lou Zigui blurted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao puffed her cheeks. </span><i><span style>What does that mean? Do you think I’m some sort of glutton? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: You mean you don’t think so yourself? </span></i><span style>&nbsp;(￢_￢))</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I know now. Let’s go,” Lou Zigui tugged at Ning Xiaoyao, who glanced at Fivehue flying in the air before docilely following along. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As they walked, she said, “Supreme Commander, are we really going to keep up our act with Song Xu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Lou Zigui nodded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Motherf***ing,” Ning Xiaoyao cursed. </span><i><span style>This really is ‘life’s a stage and all its men are merely players.’ We’re relying on our acting to live on.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What does that mean?” It wasn’t the first time Lou Zigui had heard her say such words, but he’d never understood them. Now was the time to ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urk,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “I was cursing someone just then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>Let’s just pretend I didn’t ask a thing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao returned to Supreme Splendor Hall, where Wheat met her at the door by landing on her shoulder. “Xiaoyao, Big Yellow who’s in charge of the dogs at the south gates wanted me to pass on a message. Chen Lu is currently hiding in the seventh courtyard on the left of Fangqi Lane in the south of the city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glanced at Supreme Commander Lou, then the Dragon Guards coming to welcome her back, and said, “Supreme Commander, Wheat here is hungry. I’m going to find him some food, so you go chat with Windy and the Lord Protector first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the Dragon Guards saw His Majesty dart past and asked, “Who’s Wheat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat is a sparrow,” Lou Zigui replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guards felt their mouths twitch. </span><i><span style>So does this mean His Majesty’s keeping that whole nest of sparrows in the wutong tree from the back gardens as his pets?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao found a deserted corner before crossing her legs to sit on the ground. “Come on, tell me what’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat said, “Big Yellow didn’t find me directly. He wanted to find a dog first, but none of them were capable of slipping into the palace. Elder Li’s dog, Black Panther, told him that it’s more useful to find Big Boss Black, but Big Yellow’s on bad terms with Big Boss Black. So in the end he found the head of the crows in the south city….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat, Wheat,” Ning Xiaoyao cut him off, a little dizzy from it all. “I know already, the news spread one by one until it reached you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Wheat hopped a few times on Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulders. “Xiaoyao, you’re so smart!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao suddenly felt like her missing IQ had returned!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen Lu was rescued and taken to that big courtyard,” Wheat continued. “Big Yellow was ready to help you out by biting him to death, but the masked man who took him was too powerful. Big Yellow was afraid that he and his brothers would be bitten to death instead, so they retreated first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded. “It’s no wonder Big Yellow is head of all the dogs south of the city. Doing that was the right decision. If you’re unsure about the enemy, you can’t attack them indiscriminately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Yellow even heard them say that they’d take Chen Lu to the Grand Preceptor’s estate to meet him after dark,” Wheat added. “Big Yellow suggests that you meet him tonight at Fangqi Lane and join hands to bite Chen Lu to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her chin. “I </span><i><span style>do </span></i><span style>want to bite that jerk to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But Xiaoyao, you’re not a doggie. How are you going to bite Chen Lu to death?” Wheat tilted his head at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought it over before deciding. “Then I won’t bite him, but beat him to death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat thought that was reasonable, so he continued. “A doctor went to look at Chen Lu’s wounds and said they were very serious. It’s uncertain whether he’ll live or die. Big Yellow said he heard Chen Lu say he wanted to see his family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did the masked man take Chen Lu’s family to see him?” Ning Xiaoyao guessed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat shook his head. “No. The masked man said wait until they reach the Grand Preceptor’s estate before meeting with his family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let him have his last reunion with his family,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “He’s almost dead. Wheat, tell Big Yellow that we won’t take pains with Chen Lu. I’ll owe him and his brothers a meal of bones in exchange.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Wheat agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leaning against the wall beneath the dappled shade of the trees above her, Ning Xiaoyao began to trace circles in the ground with her fingers. Tonight the empress was scheduled to leave the palace. There was no way they could let Grand Preceptor Xie find out. What was the best way to distract his subordinates away from Supreme Splendor Hall? </span><i><span style>Looks like making a ruckus at the Grand Preceptor’s estate isn’t a bad idea.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Should I start a fire?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No, </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head. </span><i><span style>There’s plenty of people there to put out the flames. That won’t distract that old Xie enough.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What if I pretend to be a ghost and scare him? </span></i><span style>That wouldn’t work either. </span><i><span style>Suppose he doesn’t believe in ghosts?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tear down his door? </span></i><span style>Again, Ning Xiaoyao shook her head. </span><i><span style>That’s no more useful than setting the place on fire.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What should I do?” Ning Xiaoyao clutched her head in thought. She didn’t have any experience in causing chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing a voice, Ning Xiaoyao looked up and waved a hand at Ji Yuerong. “Miss Ji.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong looked around them before asking, “Your Majesty, why are you by yourself here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m thinking over a problem,” Ning Xiaoyao replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” Ji Yuerong settled to sit by her side. “Did something happen?” she asked in a low voice. “Supreme Commander called my grandfather in to discuss things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don’t have to worry about their men’s affairs,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “I have a conundrum on my hands right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong only looked at her in silence. </span><i><span style>That’s an awkward way to phrase things. Your Majesty, aren’t you a man yourself? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Actually, she’s really not….)</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to cause chaos at the Grand Preceptor’s estate,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Miss Ji, what kind of trouble should I raise to capture the Grand Preceptor and his men’s attention completely tonight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong smoothed out her sleeves. “That’s easy, we’ll just go raise a row at their doors.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>This woman’s so violent. How’s she supposed to find a husband in the future like this? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: You still have the time to worry about that? </span></i><span style>&nbsp;(╯_╰))</span></p>
