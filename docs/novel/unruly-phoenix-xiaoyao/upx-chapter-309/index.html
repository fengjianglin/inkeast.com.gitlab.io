 <p><span style>Chapter 309: Supreme Commander said, this is the last time</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take some soldiers and see if you can catch up with them,” said Lou Zigui to Pei Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t catch up to them,” Ning Xiaoyao explained, “They’re on horseback.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan unhappily asked, “Did you find out who those two are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rebel forces, no, I mean bandits ah. Didn’t you already know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I mean what role do they hold with the bandits?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would they reveal this to me? I had to come up with a whole backstory before they believed that I wasn’t the emperor,” Ning Xiaoyao’s expression turned playful as she laughed, “Hehe, I’m too quick-witted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you tell them?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at Lou Zigui. (</span><i><span style>Author: Do you dare tell him the truth? </span></i><span style>(￢_￢))</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui didn’t really want to know how she deceived those two anyway. Looking in the direction of the road, Supreme Commander Lou asked Pei Yan, “If Xie Wenyuan is not along this road, which direction could he have gone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan shook his head, “I saw the troop of rebel soldiers escorting Xie Wenyuan. They could only have headed east.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, Supreme Commander also said the same, “ Ning Xiaoyao nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, where is Xie Wenyuan?” Pei Yan asked Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know ah, maybe he has gone to heaven?” Ning Xiaoyao pointed above her head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan felt that talking to this silly emperor made him very tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Lou Zigui shielded Ning Xiaoyao and walked back in the direction where they came from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They finally struggled their way over to the dirt slope. The muddy ground still made it difficult for them to walk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan brought the troops around the dirt slope, where large quantities of debris had collapsed from the landslide earlier. The group encircled it once, yet Second Young Master Pei and the men from Nine Gates Infantry Commander’s estate truly couldn’t understand it at all. </span><i><span style>They had all seen the rebel troops and Grand Preceptor walk along the dirt slope. Where did they go? They obviously didn’t die and go to heaven ah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Could they be buried under the sludge?” In front of the dirt slope, a soldier voiced their most optimistic conjecture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way,” Ning Xiaoyao shook her head, dashing everyone’s hopes, “During the landslide, I saw with my own eyes that Grand Perceptor wasn’t there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao to the side in order to avoid everyone else. He softly asked, “Why did you knock me out? Because of the landslide?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao hastily glanced towards Lou Zigui’s temple. </span><span style>“I’m alright now,” Lou Zigui urged, “Tell me, what were you thinking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Afraid that something would happen to you ah,” Ning Xiaoyao lowered her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You think I’d be fine if something happened to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh, nothing will happen to me,” Ning Xiaoyao lifted her arms. She wanted to show off her biceps to Supreme Commander Lou to prove her strength. Lou Zigui put down Ning Xiaoyao’s arms and insisted, “This is the last time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next time, tell me if there’s something going on. Don’t act on your own accord and knock me out again.” Lou Zigui looked into Ning’s Xiaoyao’s eyes. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He definitely cannot tolerate being knocked out by her whenever something goes wrong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, ok!” Ning Xiaoyao nodded her head. </span><i><span style>We’ll talk about it next time something happens then.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve planted someone by Xie Wenyuan’s side but you never heard from him again after he told you about the oncoming landslide?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t even see him, how could that person relay the matter of the landslide to me?” Ning Xiaoyao was dumbstruck and couldn’t help but answer sarcastically. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have your way of relaying information. I don’t need to know more,” Lou Zigui added. </span><i><span style>He would welcome it if she decided to share the details, if not, he wouldn’t investigate in detail.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was twisting her small body while standing in the mud. </span><i><span style>Supreme Commander, it’s better if you ask. You’re constantly assuming I have a large intelligence network! That gives me a lot of pressure, I can’t take it ah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” a soldier from the Nine Gate Infantry Commander’s estate ran over and reported, “His Excellency Pei found a broken waterskin over there, on the hillside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whose could it be?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Replying to Your Majesty, the rebels all carry this kind of waterskin with them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go take a look,” Lou Zigui softly said to Ning Xiaoyao, “Just stay here and rest for awhile.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao really had no interest in this waterskin. </span><i><span style>So what if they’ve found this waterskin, what can they do with it? So much time has passed, Grand Preceptor has long gotten away.</span></i><span style> Uttering a single “En,” to Lou Zigui, Ning Xiaoyao listlessly turned and found a chunk of rock that was exposed above the mud and sat her butt down. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui left a troop of soldiers to guard her and left with the soldiers from the Nine Gates Infantry Commander’s estate to look for Pei Yan. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui had just left, when Little Gyrfalcon called out from the sky, swooping down to rest on Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ning Xiaoyao touched the little falcon’s wet head and softly asked, “Where did you go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little falcon replied, “Xiaoyao, I’ve asked around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know where Grand Preceptor is?” Ning Xiaoyao was immediately filled with motivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s a cave near the hill,” Little Gyrfalcon pointed to the west of the hill. “The cave allows Grand Preceptor and his people to go somewhere very, very far away oh, </span><i><span style>awoo</span></i><span style>!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao jumped up from the rock she was sitting on and headed towards the west of the hill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His Majesty was only well behaved for a short while before jumping up and dashing off again. The soldiers hastily chased after Ning Xiaoyao but His Majesty was too fast. The soldiers had barely ran two steps, yet Ning Xiaoyao’s shadow had already vanished. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, Little Gyrfalcon jumped onto the ground and told Ning Xiaoyao, “It’s right here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao expressionlessly looked at the bog in front of her. </span><i><span style>How can there be a cave here, ah?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s been buried,” Little Gyrfalcon flew back onto Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder. “Huamao said she saw Grand Preceptor and his guards entering the cave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is Huamao?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huamao is also a gyrfalcon, a new friend that I’ve just met.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She must be a pretty girl huh?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The little falcon was stunned. “Xiaoyao, how did you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Huamao was a male falcon, would you have befriended her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Gyrfalcon kept quiet. </span><i><span style>If Huamao was male, they would only fight.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao squatted down and started to dig at the mud on the ground, digging away a handful of mud and a lump of weeds. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui approached Ning Xiaoyao from behind. He reached out and pulled her up. Although the mud wasn’t very deep here, it was up to Xiaoyao’s calves when she squatted down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is a cave here,” Ning Xiaoyao pointed down at her feet and informed Lou Zigui. “Grand Preceptor entered the cave but the entrance have been buried, so we can’t catch him anymore. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked down at his feet. All he saw was the light brown mud, a mixture of stones, flowers and plants. It was impossible to see the bottom underneath all of that. Naturally, he couldn’t see the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would the rebel troops help Grand Preceptor? Shouldn’t they hate Grand Preceptor? Isn’t it because of Grand Preceptor that their lives are so difficult. Didn’t Grand Preceptor push them onto the path of rebellion?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The one that they hate is Your Majesty,” Lou Zigui uttered the truth to Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt as if she had been shot with multiple arrows. She ran out of blood and wanted to die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The common people don’t care about the politics in the imperial courts. They only know that you’re the emperor. If they’re able to live well, it’s thanks to your benevolence. However, if they are suffering, it’s because you lack virtue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t say anymore.” Ning Xiaoyao clutched her heart. </span><i><span style>Even though her heart wasn’t made of glass, she could feel it breaking.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui shut his mouth and attempted to jab his foot into the ground. The ground doesn’t loosen at all. The soil and sand have completely buried and sealed the place underneath. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should we do next?” Ning Xiaoyao asked anxiously, “Have we wasted all our efforts? What about the rebel forces? Qingshan told me he wasn’t aware that Grand Preceptor was the person they were going to save.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is this Qingshan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whaa? This shouldn’t be the focus, ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked at Ning Xiaoyao.&nbsp;</span><span style>“He’s the rebel who kidnapped me,” Ning Xiaoyao honestly admitted, “He’s called Qingshan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s his last name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He didn’t tell me, I didn’t ask either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What name did you give him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told him my name was Dayao, hahaha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui had to massage his forehead again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I gave him a fake name. Do you think Qingshan could also be a fake name?” Ning Xiaoyao suddenly thought of this problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stared at Ning Xiaoyao and sighed, </span><i><span style>Missy, did you only realize the problem now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The matter about Qingshan being the young lord was at the tip of Ning Xiaoyao’s tongue, but she quickly swallowed it back down. </span><i><span style>If Supreme Commander knew that Qingshan was the head of the rebel forces, would he kill Young Lord since he couldn’t get his hands on Grand Preceptor?</span></i><span style> Aiyo, Ning Xiaoyao suddenly had second thoughts. </span><i><span style>Right now, Qingshan had fled far away, if Supreme Commander can’t get his hands on Qingshan, would he kill her, this Emperor, instead ah?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“When you realized Xie Wenyuan wasn’t there, why did you let them go?” Lou Zigui asked Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t think the rebel troops deserve to die ah,” Ning Xiaoyao explained herself seriously, “Qingshan and Danian’s family were killed by the authorities. I don’t think they are wrong to rebel. If Supreme Commander was killed by the authorities, I would definitely rebel as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui was angry yet happy at her words, “You would rebel against yourself? How would you rebel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When the late emperor was still alive, I would’ve rebelled against him if I had a way. I would… I would’ve also saved the crown prince!” </span><i><span style>What a pity she crossed over too late. Or else Crown Prince and late Lord Protector would still be alive. She also wouldn’t have allowed the late emperor and Grand Preceptor to harm Supreme Commander’s family. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s heart felt stuffy as she thought of all this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stared at Ning Xiaoyao, unable to look away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s head drooped down, “I was too useless in the past.” </span><i><span style>If only she had died earlier in the apocalypse, perhaps she could have crossed over here sooner? (Author: Don’t think about it ah, eh, helloooo…!)</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui lifted his hand and rubbed Ning Xiaoyao’s head. He gently explained, “The rebel forces helped Xie Wenyuan not because they think he is a good guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what is the reason?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Xie Wenyuan lives, you won’t be able go all out and deal with the rebel forces. The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind; Xiang Nong wants to be that oriole.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was quiet. </span><i><span style>Is there a need to make things so complicated, ah?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiang Nong may have been an impoverished person before, but now he is looking to wrest control of the country,” Lou Zigui cautioned, “Xiaoyao, you musn’t sympathize with him. This person wants to kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, can’t I just run away?” Ning Xiaoyao mumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are kind-hearted, but he’s full of bad intentions,” Lou Zigui rubbed off the muddy stains on Ning Xiaoyao’s face and said, “This is also the last time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whaa?” Ning Xiaoyao blinked her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t let those rebels off again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao lowered her head again. She didn’t dare to say the rest.</span><i><span style> She had let the young lord of the rebel forces go. After all, when Qingshan believed she was the emperor, he also let her go. &nbsp;She didn’t think he was a bad guy...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there something you haven’t told me?” Lou Zigui asked as he tilted Ning Xiaoyao’s chin up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“N...no,” Ning Xiaoyao quickly shook her head. </span><i><span style>She’ll just pretend the matter with Qingshan never happened. (Author: How can your heart be so big? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o）</span></p>
