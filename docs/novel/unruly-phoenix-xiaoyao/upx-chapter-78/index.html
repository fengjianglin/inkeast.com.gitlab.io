 <p>Chapter&nbsp;78: Supreme Commander's true face&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A small sparrow flew up from the window ledge of the reception pavilion, circled around Prince Zhi’s courtyard once, then headed towards the palace. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grand Preceptor was already arranging for your death before His Majesty ascended the throne,” Prince Zhi said inside the pavilion as he looked at Lou Zigui. “If it was really a self-injury ruse, then you and the Grand Preceptor would’ve had to plan everything out before the late crown prince died. You betrayed His Highness Crown Prince?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The candlelight flickered briefly in the pavilion. Lou Zigui still looked as calm as ever, his lips still curved up into a smile. “His Highness Crown Prince was simply unlucky,” he said to Prince Zhi. “How could an unlucky person like that become emperor? Moreover, even if His Highness Crown Prince had ascended the throne, his first thing would’ve been to dissolve the vassal lords. Does prince think well of that?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So Xie Wenyuan found out from Lou Zigui that I was doing business with the Northern Hu before he found me himself? </span></i><span style>Prince Zhi stared at Lou Zigui and couldn’t help but feel that the entire situation was too mystifying for him to untangle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Prince,” Lou Zigui said, “Can Song Jin accompany your caravan to leave the capital city tomorrow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is the current quarrel between His Majesty and Xie Wenyuan a sham as well?” Prince Zhi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s simply a power struggle,” Supreme Commander Lou replied, which was equal to saying nothing at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>For the sake of power, His Majesty could either quarrel with the Grand Preceptor or join hands with him to dismiss the vassal lords. Since Prince Zhi couldn’t get a clear answer, he simply stopped asking and nodded his head. “Tomorrow evening, have Song Jin go to the north gate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rose and gave him a bow. “Many thanks to prince.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Zhi didn’t see him off, but simply waved his hand. “You may leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui turned and walked out of the reception pavilion. Prince Zhi remained sitting there by himself. </span><i><span style>If Lou Zigui and Xie Wenyuan know that I’ve been dealing with the Northern Hu, what of Ning Yu? Wouldn’t he know as well? Maybe I shouldn’t stay in the capital city after all, </span></i><span style>Prince Zhi realized with a start as he stared at the flickering candlelight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Once you’ve exited the capital with Prince Zhi’s caravan, find a way to leave their group,” Lou Zigui quietly instructed Song Jin on their way back to the palace. “The road will be dangerous, so be careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Jin couldn’t help but feel his heart ache when he recalled the money his Supreme Commander had given away. Now General Song felt like dying even more at his words. “Will Prince Zhi betray us even after accepting our money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s untrustworthy to begin with,” Lou Zigui said as he urged on his horse. “What, you believe him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why did you give him so much money, Supreme Commander?” Song Jin said, still pained. “If it was given to the troops, we…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That money was simply collateral,” Lou Zigui interrupted Song Jin’s angry rant. “If we didn’t give Prince Zhi something he likes, would he agree to bring you out of the capital?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One person offered a bribe while the other accepted, leaving both parties in the wrong. This was the only way to strike a deal with a bastard like Prince Zhu, who could even neglect the duties of his forefathers at Qiufeng City for the chance to turn a profit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Would he, would he turn me over to the Grand Preceptor after bringing me out of the city?” Song Jin asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps, perhaps not,” Lou Zigui replied. “But either way, it'll be safer if you travel alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Jin nodded and followed after Lou Zigui in silence for awhile before he spoke up again. “Is there still hope for Yongning like this?” After seeing his share of imperial clansmen and court officials, General Seventh Song couldn't help but question their plight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui turned to look at Song Jin and laughed. “I was thinking of whether Prince Fu can get skinny.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” went Song Jin. </span><i><span style>Supreme Commander, if you don't want to talk about it, there's no need to forcefully change the topic to Prince Fu.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think Prince Fu will get skinnier?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How am I supposed to answer that question? Do I call the shots on whether or not he loses weight?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can Prince Fu really get skinnier?” Shadowgale was asking Ning Xiaoyao the very same question in the little flower garden behind the main hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry,” Ning Xiaoyao was currently stuffing </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%E7%BA%A2%E8%B1%86%E7%B3%95&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj3KnN2N_WAhUo4oMKHZWPANwQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1417&amp;bih=736" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>red bean cake</span></a><span style> into her mouth. She grinned as she asked, “Did Little Peach Blossom make these?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale’s expression turned stiff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be like that,” Ning Xiaoyao sat below the wutong tree. “Come on, tell me about your Little Peach Blossom. How far have you gone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale didn’t want to talk with Ning Xiaoyao anymore. Was now the time to talk about Little Peach Blossom?! Meanwhile, a little sparrow landed on Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder and started chirping by her ear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” went Shadowgale. </span><i><span style>It couldn’t be that His Majesty’s raising this sparrow, too?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Windy, go take a walk with Little Peach Blossom and chat about life with her,” Ning Xiaoyao took the little sparrow into her palm as she spoke to Shadowgale, who could only withdraw. He wasn’t in any mood to go find Little Peach Blossom for company, because he wanted to be on night watch duty over Prince Fu!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Shadowgale left, Ning Xiaoyao asked the sparrow, “Supreme Commander really said those things to Prince Zhi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, </span><i><span style>chirp~” </span></i><span style>the little sparrow bobbed its head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re lying!” Big Boss Black jumped out from behind the Wutong tree with an fierce shout. “You have to be the Grand Preceptor’s bird, sent here to sow discord amongst us. Miaow, I’ll eat you up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black leaped up into the air, only to be buffeted aside by Ning Xiaoyao. The little sparrow shook its body of feathers and said seriously, “Xiaoyao, I’m not the Grand Preceptor’s bird.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed the sparrow’s chubby tummy. This she believed, because she’d never seen a bird cage in the Grand Preceptor’s estate before. He wasn’t some bird enthusiast. (</span><i><span style>Author: Even if the Grand Preceptor kept a bird, he wouldn’t keep a sparrow of all things, right? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o )</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black sprawled on the ground as he meowed, “Xiaoyao, this damned bird must be tricking you. Supreme Commander isn’t that type of man!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandfather Sparrow took the chance to alight on Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder, and the little sparrow spoke up again. “Grandfather Sparrow, Wheat isn’t lying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandfather Sparrow’s tone was stern. “Xiaoyao, Wheat is a good child, he wouldn’t lie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miaow!” Big Boss Black’s fur was standing on end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao nodded. “Mm, I believe Wheat. Come on, Wheat, I’ll treat you to some red bean cake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat was very happy, because red bean cake was super yummy. Grandfather Sparrow looked at Ning Xiaoyao in concern. “Xiaoyao, what do you plan to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black scurried up Ning Xiaoyao’s leg and cried, “Xiaoyao, you can’t kill my Supreme Commander, ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, there was no smile on Ning Xiaoyao’s face. “He actually gave money to Prince Zhi,” she muttered to the animals. “If I knew about this earlier, I would’ve used the money for myself, ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said the little animals. </span><i><span style>Aren’t you missing the point?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You,” </span></i><span style>Grandfather Sparrow said. “Xiaoyao, Supreme Commander knew about Prince Zhi’s liaisons with the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu, </span></i><span style>oh. From what I understand, he doesn’t want to annihilate the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>at all. He’s worried that he’ll be abandoned by you once the threat of the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>is gone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Isn’t it good to do business?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course it isn’t good,” Big Boss Black bared his claws at Ning Xiaoyao again. “If you sell iron to the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu, </span></i><span style>then they can make weapons. If you sell them grain, they can fight without having to go hungry. How could this be any good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” went the little animals. </span><i><span style>Black Tubby, can your Supreme Commander still live after your words?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A dark shadow fell across Ning Xiaoyao’s face. His Majesty Ning raised her head and saw Lou Zigui standing right in front of her, so she simply asked, “Supreme Commander, you knew that Prince Zhi was doing business with the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu, </span></i><span style>so why didn’t you say anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui froze in place before Ning Xiaoyao. Wheat and Grandfather Sparrow flew onto a branch, while Big Boss Black hid behind Ning Xiaoyao’s legs. The chirping and meowing flower gardens immediately turned silent. Ning Xiaoyao gave Lou Zigui a perplexed look and said, “Tell me about your reasons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui hid the hand holding an oilpaper package behind his back before he asked, “Your Majesty knows all about the conversation between me and Prince Zhi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao replied, “Yes, I have little pals at Prince Zhi’s estate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>Little pals again?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat gave a cheerful chirp from the branches. He was one of Ning Xiaoyao’s little pals now! Grandfather Sparrow pecked him on the head. Now wasn’t the time to be happy. They had to keep a solemn silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I,” underneath the tree, Lou Zigui spoke. “I can explain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao crossed her legs and sat down to prepare for a long talk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “I was thinking of it this way. Without these business deals, the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>would invade the borders more frequently.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Ning Xiaoyao didn’t understand. What kind of logic was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>people have no iron, cloth, or tea. They’re lacking in many types of medicine. Aside from their flocks, they have nothing else,” Lou Zigui explained. Meanwhile, Ning Xiaoyao imagined a savage world in her head. </span><i><span style>So in other words, I live in a feudal society while those Northern Hu live in a prehistoric one? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Don’t make wild guesses, ahhh!</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can understand the thoughts of the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu,” </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui half-knelt in front of Ning Xiaoyao as he lowered his voice. “When their parents, women, and children are starving to death before their eyes while we Yongning people have plenty of provisions, why wouldn’t they kill their way to our lands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought it over. “So because they’re starving to death, they come over to kill and pillage? What kind of logic is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If there ever comes a day when you’re starving to death, I’d go steal, too,” Lou Zigui said as he looked at Ning Xiaoyao, who felt a little floored.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “I wouldn’t be able to just watch you die. That’s why I can understand what the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>are thinking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao dug her fingers into her palms. For some reason, her heartbeats had sped up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “Those years I spent at the border were extremely tough. Even the top soldiers of the Black Frost Cavalry couldn’t kill more than 40% of their numbers. Xiaoyao, it’s not that I fear death, but that I don’t want to send my soldiers to their death. If the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>weren’t trapped with no way out, they wouldn’t invade us so readily.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao clutched her head in thought. </span><i><span style>In other words, if we fill the stomachs of the Northern Hu, they won’t quarrel with Yongning anymore? </span></i><span style>“That’s not right,” Ning Xiaoyao dropped her hands. “Although doing business has its positives, they why does the government--I mean, the imperial court--disallow it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because we can’t,” Lou Zigui replied.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could he speak properly? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glared at him. Lou Zigui wanted to stroke Ning Xiaoyao’s head, but withdrew his hand under Ning Xiaoyao’s stare. “If business is done in secret, it’ll limit the goods sent over the border and jack up their prices as well. As long as the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu </span></i><span style>don’t die, but don’t eat their fill either while we deplete their wealth, it’s not a bad deal in my eyes. But if large numbers of traders did business with them, it’d only benefit the Northern </span><i><span style>Hu. </span></i><span style>A few merchants would profit from the trade, but it’d hurt our country as a whole.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao scratched her palms as she shot another glance at Supreme Commander Lou. </span><i><span style>So you’re letting Prince Zhi be all sneaky with the Northern Hu? A black-bellied schemer, that should be your true self, right?</span></i></p>
