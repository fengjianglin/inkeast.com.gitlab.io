 <p>Chapter&nbsp;160: His Majesty says, Supreme Commander isn't a villain&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li went to beg for an audience at the palace before daylight had even broke the horizon. Ning Xiaoyao had just warmed up her covers, but was now forced to crawl out of bed, yawning, as Shadowgale told her the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale said, “Your Majesty, this servant tried to coax Elder Li to wait until it was brighter, but he still insisted on seeing you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If he wants to, then let him. All that dying and burning in the city probably made it impossible for the old gramps to sleep,” Ning Xiaoyao attempted to comb her hair with her fingers until she managed some semblance of a bun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale glanced at the bun atop Ning Xiaoyao’s head. Though the style fit Ning Xiaoyao as a person, it didn’t suit his identity as the reigning emperor at all. He wanted to help Ning Xiaoyao redo his hair, but he didn’t have the skills to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grabbing a sugar bean to plop in her mouth, Ning Xiaoyao asked, “Where’s Supreme Commander?” She definitely needed a companion when meeting with Elder Li. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale replied, “Supreme Commander went to meet with Xie Anwu. Does Your Majesty wish to summon him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao patted her chest confidently. </span><i><span style>That’s right, Xie Anwu. He’s the son of Grand Preceptor Xie’s concubine that Supreme Commander had brought to the palace to meet me. I have been so busy I forgot all about him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Shall this servant go call Supreme Commander?” Shadowgale asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Windy, </span><i><span style>you </span></i><span style>come with me to see old gramps. It’s not good to disturb other people’s conversations, after all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale had absolutely no idea how His Majesty’s mind worked. </span><i><span style>An imperial decree doesn’t count as a disruption... </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao straightened out her clothes as she thought of Elder Li’s thin, never-changing-for-a-thousand-years-face. She had a momentary flash of panic and resolved to get in good graces with Elder Li’s wife as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” Shadowgale saw that Ning Xiaoyao was still standing by the doorway and spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Ning Xiaoyao said, but missed the threshold of the door and tripped, flailing forwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!” Shadowgale quickly ran over to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she picked herself up from the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s dust on your face…” Shadowgale wanted to say, but after seeing His Majesty cup some rainwater to wash it off, he shut up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to give old gramps a explanation for last night’s events,” Ning Xiaoyao said, sipping a few palmfuls of rainwater as well. “I might be at fault, but so is the Grand Preceptor, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale was all straight faced as he asked, “Where did Your Majesty possibly go wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was too greedy,” Ning Xiaoyao answered. “After coveting so much of the Grand Preceptor’s land and houses, why wouldn’t he lose his temper?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale couldn’t accept Ning Xiaoyao talking about herself like that and immediately moved to speak up, but she beat him to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough, Windy. You don’t have to say anything,” Ning Xiaoyao waved her hand at him. “No need to comfort me, I understand everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Shadowgale. </span><i><span style>What is this ‘everything’ that you understand?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao took the umbrella from Mute Nanny’s hands and opened it up to enter the rain. </span><i><span style>Mistakes are mistakes, you have to own up to them when you make them. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li had been brought to a small study by Shadowthunder. When Ning Xiaoyao entered, she didn’t wait for him to bow but shouted, “No need for formalities. Old gramps, have a seat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li still paid Ning Xiaoyao a respectful bow and thanked her for her grace before sitting in the chair to her left. Ning Xiaoyao observed Elder Li’s face, but couldn’t discern anything from his expression. Elder Li scrutinized Ning Xiaoyao as well, and felt that she didn’t look like someone who had a sleepless night. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Elder Li said after withdrawing his gaze, “Many officials wanted to come, but this official stopped them to speak with Your Majesty alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Then old gramps, speak up. I’ll hear you out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li glanced at Shadowgale, who was standing next to Ning Xiaoyao, and she said, “Windy’s not an outsider. Old gramps, feel free to say anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li said, “This official would like to ask Your Majesty, what were the true causes of the fires in the capital last night?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urk,” Ning Xiaoyao gulped. “I received quite a bit of the Grand Preceptor’s houses and other deeds. The Grand Preceptor didn’t want to give them to me, so he sent his men to burn down the most valuable of the houses and shops.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li then asked, “Then why was there an insurrection with the refugees?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because of Xie Anshi, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “He heard the refugees bad mouthing his Xie Clan and burned a bunch of them to death. Then the refugees got mad and killed their way to Tao Chen’s house, where he was staying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li said, “Your Majesty, what did Supreme Commander do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander?” Ning Xiaoyao glanced at Shadowgale. </span><i><span style>Did Supreme Commander do something bad?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale murmured back, “Your Majesty, this servant was off collecting the lands outside the capital, so your servant doesn’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pursed her lips. </span><i><span style>Well, I was at the palace, so I have no clue, either. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li saw that Ning Xiaoyao had fallen silent and said, “How about this official put it another way: was Supreme Commander involved in the refugee uprising in any way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope,” Ning Xiaoyao hastened to say. “Supreme Commander didn’t poison the refugees, so how could he stir them up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Elder Li. </span><i><span style>Is poison the only way to stir up a crowd?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was still lost. “Old gramps, why are you asking about that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Supreme Commander Lou used the refugees as tools in a scheme, then how is he any different from Xie Wenyuan?” Elder Li gave Ning Xiaoyao a piercing stare. “Your Majesty, what do you think about this matter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao considered the question for a bit and found that Elder Li’s words made sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Elder Li continued. “Ruling a country means ruling people’s hearts as well. You should keep able officials at your side and distance the small and petty men. Only then can the country truly prosper.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urk, but Supreme Commander’s not small or petty,” Ning Xiaoyao shook her head at him. “Supreme Commander’s not that kind of man. He’d never do something like that, honestly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty is certain of that?” Elder Li asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale was looking at Ning Xiaoyao as well. </span><i><span style>Are you sure about that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao nodded without hesitation. “Mhm.” </span><i><span style>Even if Supreme Commander Lou has a bag of evil tricks up his sleeve, he’ll never be someone like that evil old geezer Xie, ah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li thought over her words carefully. </span><i><span style>If it wasn’t Lou Zigui, then was it someone else that hated Xie Wenyuan? His son’s severely injured while his daughter and son-in-law’s family are all dead. If Xie Wenyuan takes revenge, not one of the capital’s refugees will survive. All of their lives depend on a single thought in Xie Wenyuan’s head. His disposition is too cold and sinister to let this slide.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If Xie Anshi hadn’t killed people, the refugees wouldn’t have gotten angry, either,” Ning Xiaoyao spoke up for the crowd. “Old gramps, if you’re feeling sorry for the Tao Clan’s children, are you saying those refugee children deserved to die instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First, he murdered people, then he went to visit his older sister’s house like nothing had ever happened,” Ning Xiaoyao added. “That Xie Anshi didn’t treat refugee lives like anything at all. I don’t care what you think, old gramps, but I don’t pity him a bit. As for Tao Chen---you can blame Xie Anshi for that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li said, “Supreme Commander Lou was present when Xie Anshi was dying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not like Supreme Commander owes him anything, so why should he have helped that bastard?” Ning Xiaoyao arched an eyebrow. “Old gramps, I just realized, but you’re here to stir up trouble for Supreme Commander, aren’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dare I ask Your Majesty in which place have I erred?” Elder Li countered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You haven’t even toppled the Grand Preceptor yet, but you’re now setting your sights on Supreme Commander too?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “Aren’t you just shooting your cannons all over the map?” </span><i><span style>This old gramps, why does it feel like he’s everyone’s enemy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li stared at Ning Xiaoyao for a long time before asking cautiously, “What is </span><i><span style>‘shooting your cannons all over the map?’”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s talk about that another time,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Supreme Commander’s not a villain, oi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui silently walked away from his position by the door. Shadowthunder exhaled in relief when he saw his commander leave. Just then, he’d hardly dared to breathe. Ning Xiaoyao glanced at the closed study door and wondered whether Supreme Commander felt hurt after hearing how Elder Li suspected his character. (</span><i><span style>Author: Why don’t you worry about yourself instead…</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li didn’t have enhanced hearing like Ning Xiaoyao, so he never knew Lou Zigui had come and gone during their conversation. Instead he asked, “Your Majesty, why would the Xie Clan’s titles and deeds be in your hands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Old Madame bequeathed them to me,” Ning Xiaoyao answered confidently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li shook his head. “Your Majesty, Old Madame Xie was suddenly assassinated. How could someone who was violently murdered leave behind a legacy for her descendents?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao had an inkling that things were getting complicated again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If she didn’t know she was going to die,” Elder Li carefully explained, “How could she know how to arrange her inheritance matters?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stammered, “A-aren’t these things prepared ahead of time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty resides in the palace,” Elder Li said, “So when did Old Madame Xie get a chance to tell you of her arrangements?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao scratched her palms with her fingers. </span><i><span style>What if I just make something up? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale spoke up for her and said, “Elder, are you doubting His Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impudence!” Elder Li whirled towards Shadowgale. “Since when have the Dragon Guards earned the right to meddle in business between a sovereign and his officials?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale was rendered mute by Elder Li’s words. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Aiya,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said. “Is it really that big of a deal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li stood up to kneel at Ning Xiaoyao’s feet, before proclaiming loudly, “Your Majesty, these are established customs. Officials have officials’ duties, just as guards have guard duties. How could the two of them ever mix?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh God. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao clutched her head. </span><i><span style>Can I quit being the emperor?! This is too annoying. Old gramps can even talk big about why people can’t talk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Elder Li wanted to continue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop talking already, I’m begging you,” Ning Xiaoyao cut in. “Just spare me, I’ll tell you the truth, alright? Old gramps, you get up first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li rose to his feet. “Did Your Majesty claim them for yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I really didn’t,” Ning Xiaoyao began to tell Elder Li about the pickled vegetable jars. Finally, she finished and said, “Old gramps, you were there too. Grand Preceptor said he’d give them to me, so how could that be me claiming them for myself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Elder Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That there,” Ning Xiaoyao picked up a title deed for land off a table and waved it in Elder Li’s face. “The land’s already in our hands. Old gramps, bring some people with you to have a look at them. See how many refugees from the capital you can move over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li stared at the deed in Ning Xiaoyao’s hands, still too speechless to talk. </span><i><span style>How can this be? The fires in the western part of the capital, the insurrection of the refugees, the extermination of Tao Chen and his family, Xie Anshi burning as a human torch---all of it came from such a ridiculously laughable reason?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stared at Elder Li, who was neither moving nor speaking. </span><i><span style>Did I talk so much that he doesn’t want to continue the conversation anymore again?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui went through the complicated maze of covered corridors until he reached Xie Anwu’s temporary quarters in the palace and pushed open the door. Inside, the fourth young master of the Xie Clan was sitting about idly in the room until Lou Zigui’s arrival made him scramble to his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sit down,” Lou Zigui gestured to Xie Anwu, who obediently found a seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie Anshi has been severely injured,” Lou Zigui took one of the empty chairs facing Xie Anwu. “Even if he survives, he’s nothing but a cripple now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anwu had just sat down when Lou Zigui’s words startled him into standing up again. Lou Zigui looked over at Xie Anwu, his expression temperate and mild. Then he remarked, “You still have time to return to the Xie Clan now if you wish. Xie Anji isn’t suited for grand plans. Two of the official wife’s three sons have been completed eliminated, leaving only the one useless spare. Now is the time for you concubine’s sons to make a name for themselves.”</span></p>
