 <p><span style>Chapter 302: After the city was invaded...</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the south city gate tower, Ning Xiaoyao was observing to see whether the enemies were retreating. When suddenly, shouts of fighting travelled from the west side of the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The west side?” Lord Protector heard the cries and paused and turned to Pei Yan to confirm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the west city wall.” Pei Yan replied, “Who’s the person stationed at the west gate now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector reported a name that Ning Xiaoyao had never heard before, then reassured her, “There wouldn’t be a problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the sounds of rumbling started again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao exclaimed, “They’re shooting cannons at the west gate ah!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Pei brothers glanced at each other and Pei Yan asserted, “Your Majesty, this subject will escort you out of the capital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao didn’t understand anything that had happened so far. </span><i><span style>What exactly is happening? Why do they want to send her out of the capital again?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Since Lou Zigui is not around, Your Majesty can replace him as the pillar of the army outside the capital.” Second Young Master Pei tried to trick Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at the hill of corpses outside the capital. </span><i><span style>The cause of this massacre was the lack of a pillar in the army?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty??” Pei Yan shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of explosions was continuously coming from the west gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head and felt that there was something definitely wrong with this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Yan coaxed, “If Your Majesty is afraid, then forget it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s mouth twitched. </span><i><span style>She has been through the apocalypse, how could she be afraid of something like this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” Ning Xiaoluo’s voice travelled from the staircase. Ning Xiaoyao turned her head towards the staircase to look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rain had thoroughly drenched Ning Xiaoluo. He ran to Ning Xiaoyao like he was panic stricken. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you here?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo stood in front of Ning Xiaoyao, panting, “My brother told me to follow Your Majesty out of the south gate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are we leaving the capital?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.” Third Young Master Ning spoke very seriously, &nbsp;“My big brother said since Lou Zigui is at the west gate, the soldiers at the south gate have no pillar of support. With Your Majesty out of the capital, we can appease the soldiers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao: ...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Pei brothers: … </span></p>
 <p><span style>This suspicious reason was now used consecutively by two different people. </span><i><span style>What does this mean?</span></i><span style> Ning Xiaoyao stroked her chin. </span><i><span style>There’s definitely something wrong with this explanation ah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty.” Ning Xiaoluo added, “Miss Ji and Shadowgale of the Dragon Guards are waiting down by the gate. My brother said after the enemy troops at the south gate have retreated, Elder Li and the others can leave from there as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>I</span></i><span style> have to be the pillar of the army?” Ning Xiaoyao questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes ah,” Ning Xiaoluo nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just then, there was a sound of a louder detonation, Ning Xiaoyao asked, “Little Luoluo, where is Big Bro Ning now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Definitely in the palace.” Second Young Master Pei immediately replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He has gone to the west gate.” Ning Xiaoluo said at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After both of them spoke simultaneously, they stared at each other. Third Young Master Ning lost the staring contest and lowered his head. He didn’t dare to take another look at Second Young Master Pei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is the west gate in danger, ah?” Ning Xiaoyao fretted. “Is that why we are sending everyone towards the south?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not possible.” Lord Protector hurriedly shook his head. “No matter how many cannons they have, the city walls will not fall.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s face stiffened. She looked at the three people standing in front of her and ridiculed, “Do I look like an idiot to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Young Master Ning hurriedly stuttered, “You’re not.. I am.. Your Majesty.. Can we leave the capital now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the swollen pig head before her, Ning Xiaoyao sighed. </span><i><span style>In any case, this punk really isn’t smart</span></i><span style>. “You all escort old gramps and the others out of the capital, I will head to the west gate to take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!!” Ning Xiaoluo exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned and ran off. </span><i><span style>At this point, she would have to squeeze out whatever energy she had left. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Third Young Master Ning pounced on air and directly fell onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector and Pei Yan wanted to chase after her, but when Ning Xiaoyao is determined to run with all her life, how could the Pei brothers even hope to catch her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao ran down the city gate tower and rapidly sprinted her way to the west gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale just saw a silhouette pass him. After trying to take a second look, NIng Xiaoyao’s shadow was gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector rushed down the city gate tower and shouted, “Your Majesty???”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale was shocked. There was no doubt that the person that had just passed him was His Majesty. Without a word, Shadowgale leapt on a horse and instantly gave chase to Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong, clad in armor, met with the Pei brothers. Pei Yan instructed, “Miss Ji, please assist my brother in escorting the officials out of the capital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector immediately stopped Pei Yan from leaving. “You go with Miss Ji, I will protect His Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is His Majesty?” Ji Yuerong asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He ran away.” Lord Protector wiped his face. </span><i><span style>Sometimes, when His Majesty is too capable, it is also a concern!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You can first escort these officials out and then come back,” Pei Yan flung off Lord Protector’s hand. He ran and flipped onto the warhorse then headed for the west gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector looked at Miss Ji. He couldn’t bring himself to ask her to escort the officials out of the capital alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Protector should go to protect His Majesty.” Just when the Lord Protector was at a loss, Ji Yuerong took the initiative to speak. “I can escort the officials out of the capital. After ensuring their safety, I will return immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Deng Rong is just outside the capital. After victory has been decided, Miss Ji can hand the people over to Deng Rong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I understand.” Jie Yuerong nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector gave Miss Ji a cupped fist and urgently left for the west gate as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lord Protector was gone, Ning Xiaoluo finally arrived at the bottom of the city gate tower. After falling over and hitting the ground, Third Young Master Ning started sporting a huge bruise on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong couldn’t bear to look at him. </span><i><span style>If this face keeps getting damaged, will it ever heal? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo walked over to Ji Yuerong and looked at the crowd behind her. “His Majesty ran off, ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you go up the city gate tower?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo open his mouth. After inadvertently collecting a mouthful of rainwater, he decided to close it again. He swallowed down the rainwater and complained, “I just said what my brother taught me to say, who would’ve thought His Majesty wouldn’t believe me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yuerong walked towards Elder Li. She really didn’t want to talk to a guy who was useless without his big brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the way, Ning Xiaoyao met with a platoon of soldiers that were running from the west gate to the city barracks. “How is the west gate ah?” Ning Xiaoyao stopped the soldiers and yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers couldn’t recognise Ning Xiaoyao and stared at her guardedly as they stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao justified, “I am the emperor, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers still didn’t say anything. </span><i><span style>Who knows if he’s telling the truth?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Grand Preceptor’s men want to kill me. Why would I pretend to be the emperor for fun?” Ning Xiaoyao wiped the rain off her face and pointed out, “Lil bro, quickly tell me, how’s the situation at the west gate ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The situation is not good.” a soldier who looked only sixteen or seventeen reported to Ning Xiaoyao, “The First Young Master with the Ning surname ordered us to go protect the palace gates.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many enemy troops are there outside the capital? Ning Xiaoyao frantically asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sure,” the young soldier shook his head, “It’s full of people outside the capital. Also...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are also cannons!” Ning Xiaoyao completed his sentence, “I know, I can hear the explosions too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’ve broken through the city wall!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The city gates have opened——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rebels are entering the capital!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run ah——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Panic and confused shouts were heard from the city gates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt an explosion in her mind. </span><i><span style>The capital has been invaded?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, leave quickly! Your Majesty!” the young soldier hollered at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you return to the palace first.” Ning Xiaoyao ran past this platoon and headed for the west gate like a gust of wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the citizens who were capable of leaving the capital have already left. The only people who were left were all hiding at home. Thus, there were very few people running on the streets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From afar, Ning Xiaoyao saw Ning Xiaomu riding a horse towards her. First Young Master Ning was holding a sword with blood dripping from the tip of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” First Young Master Ning arrived in front of Ning Xiaoyao in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Bro Ning!” Ning Xiaoyao stood in front of Ming Guang the horse and raised her head to look at First Young Master Ning, “Are you injured?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Young Master Ning reached out and pulled Ning Xiaoyao onto the horse. Whipping his horse, he headed towards the palace. “Didn’t you leave through the south gate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At this moment, I can’t run away.” Ning Xiaoyao shook her head, “I’ve already discussed with Supreme Commander. Unless I am in a life and death situation, I can’t run.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He…!” First Young Master Ning wanted to curse Lou Zigui but he suppressed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Also, Big Bro Ning is still at the west gate as well,” Ning Xiaoyao added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty is here to look for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” Ning Xiaoyao nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Young Master Ning paused for a moment and lightly rubbed his chin on Ning Xiaoyao’s head. He whispered, “Your Majesty is worried about me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm, I’m afraid you will get injured ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Young Master Ning smiled, but this smile had yet to blossom before the sound of horses rushed towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned to look, “Are those enemy soldiers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sit tight,” First Young Master Ning pulled Ning Xiaoyao to a secure position. </span><i><span style>It’s too late to send little sister out of the capital. If he tries, the rebel troops will follow and Elder Li and the other officials at the south gate would inevitably die.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fiercely whipping Ming Guang, First Young Master Ning quickly galloped to the direction of the palace with Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers, who were running on foot, couldn’t outrun the horse and saw that the enemy soldiers were approaching. They immediately headed for the alleys and smaller streets. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the battle, their general had instructed them to look for a place to hide. They were only to attack the enemy soldiers after they have entered the alleys.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale and the Pei brothers arrived one after another and encountered First Young Master Ning and Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They broke through the west gate?” Lord Protector saw First Young Master Ning and shrieked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Young Master Ning nodded his head at Lord Protector. Ming Guang dashed past Lord Protector. Lord Protector swung his fist in the air and turned his horse to follow after First Young Master Ning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the time it took to burn half an incense, First Young Master Ning and Ning Xiaoyao finally ran through the palace gates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lord Protector entered the palace, he immediately got off his horse and ran up the city gate tower. Below the city gate tower, Shadowgale roared, “Close the gates! Immediately close the palace gates!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao asked First Young Master Ning, “The enemies have cannons, can the palace gates hold up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The palace gates can hold up. Rest assure, Your Majesty.” First Young Master Ning didn’t stop his horse even when passing the kneeling eunuchs. He directly leapt over them with his horse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go back and tell Empress Dowager,” Ning Xiaoyao shouted from the horse to the eunuchs, “The war has started, but as long as she remains in her palace, she’ll be fine!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shouts of killing travelled from the palace gates. The eunuchs got up and ran towards Empress Dowager’s palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector stood at the top of the city gate tower with the generals of the Elite Imperial Guards. They watched as the rebels pushed several cannons to the front of the military formation. All the generals were troubled. </span><i><span style>How many blasts could the palace gates and city gate tower take?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>First Young Master Ning placed Ning Xiaoyao in front of the Supreme Splendor Hall before redirecting his horse. “I’m going to the palace gates. Your Majesty must remember the words you said. If you are in a dire situation, you must leave the capital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without First Young Master Ning’s body sheltering her, there was no one to block the rain from hitting Ning Xiaoyao. Her eyes could barely open from the heavy rain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, you must be safe,” First Young Master Ning sat on the horse and lightly patted Ning Xiaoyao’s head before turning to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wiped her eyes and watched as First Young Master Ning’s distance grew further and further away from her.</span></p>
