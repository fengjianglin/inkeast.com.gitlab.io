 <p><span style>Xie Anshi had already been beaten during the day, and now he was being thrashed yet again. Unable to bear the blows, he simply lost consciousness on the ground. When the Second Young Master Luo saw that only a few punches had knocked out his younger brother-in-law, he was left dumbfounded. Eldest Young Master Luo Wei[2 </span><i><span style>Luo Wei </span></i><span style>(骆玮) - </span><i><span style>Luo </span></i><span style>is a surname that means “white horse with a black mane” in archaic Chinese, </span><i><span style>Wei </span></i><span style>means “a kind of jade, valuable/precious.”] was still in the throes of his anger, but he’d finally come to his senses. </span><i><span style>How could Xie Anshi ever arrange for a little pageboy to attend to his mistress? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak, just who are you?” Luo Wei pointed at Ning Xiaoyao angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt that this young master of the Luo Clan was pretty smart. She’d done so well with her acting, but he’d still seen through her. (</span><i><span style>Author: This has nothing to do with your acting skills, arite...</span></i><span style>) Luo Wei stepped forward to grab Ning Xiaoyao, but Lou Zigui beat him to it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He shielded Ning Xiaoyao behind his back and said, “Look to the master before you beat his dog. You should consider how to explain yourself to your master first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Luo brothers’ faces turned a sickly green at his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao along with him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao raised a hand to bid the Luo brothers farewell. “I’m an enemy agent, haha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...........” said Shadowgale and the rest, who’d resumed their places on the wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t glare at me,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Would those two hug each other if they didn’t harbor mutual feelings? How could third young madame’s figure compare to Lady Yan Hong’s? You’re all men, so you should understand, heheh.” Ning Xiaoyao had only caught a glimpse of the Xie Clan’s third young madame. She had no idea what she looked like, but she’d remembered the woman had been as flat as a board. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Luo brothers’ faces changed from sickly green to a furious black. </span><i><span style>Like hell they should ‘understand!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale told his fellow guards, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You could be enemies with anyone as long as it wasn’t His Majesty. Otherwise, His Majesty would definitely leave you in a state worse than death.</span></i><span style> When the Dragon Guards heard Ning Xiaoyao fling figurative mud at Xie Anshi, their understanding of His Majesty deepened to yet another level. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui hadn’t even brought Ning Xiaoyao out of the courtyard yet before Third Young Master Xie regained consciousness beneath the rain. He remained prone on the ground as he shouted, “Luo Rui, you dared to raise a hand against me? Are you seeking death?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rolled her eyes. “See that? Lackeys get no respect at all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?” Xie Anshi shouted before he even spotted Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not your father, that’s for sure,” Ning Xiaoyao shouted in return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anshi was so furious that he leapt up from the ground and ordered, “Capture that bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Grand Preceptor’s men wanted to cry. </span><i><span style>Lou Zigui was here. Would we even survive a fight against that star of disaster? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Lou Zigui said again as he pulled Ning Xiaoyao out of the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao harrumphed. “Yan Hong’s a bad guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you say that?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her scent was in that basement,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she pointed at her nose. “When I was squatting next to her, I smelled the same thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe she delivered meals to the people there,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She didn’t,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Someone who delivered meals wouldn’t stop to sit on the chairs in the basement. This woman’s probably a character worth noting on the Grand Preceptor’s side. Oh, let me explain a bit further. I caught a whiff of her face powder on one of the chairs in the basement. There were even flowers engraved on the back of that chair.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what kind of nose do you have? </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui thought as he rested his forehead against his palm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao added, “But if she’s really a character, then why is she Xie Laibao’s lover?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Lou Zigui’s hand dropped from his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “I never mentioned it? Yan Hong’s involved in an illicit love affair with Xie Laibao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stopped walking. Ning Xiaoyao was still caught up in her thoughts and muttering to herself. “Could it be that Xie Laibao has a big whachamacallit and does a good job as a man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and capture that woman,” Lou Zigui instructed the guards behind him. A few imperial guards ran off to apprehend Yan Hong. Meanwhile, Lou Zigui turned back to Ning Xiaoyao and asked, “A big what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao raised her head to peer at Lou Zigui, before suddenly shifting her gaze downwards. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said Supreme Commander Lou, who suddenly understood what she meant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What I think,” Ning Xiaoyao began, wanting to discuss this further with Supreme Commander Lou. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But Lou Zigui simply clamped her mouth and muttered wearily, “Let’s just go.” By the time he pulled her out out the front door, an imperial guard ran out with an unconscious Yan Hong over his shoulders. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s still unconscious?” Ning Xiaoyao asked from her perch atop Little Red, the battle horse. Xie Anshi could wake up from a thrashing, but that beauty was still unconscious just from a little pinch? (</span><i><span style>Author: So, exactly just how much strength did you use?</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Lou Zigui’s heels dug into the flank of the horse, propelling them towards the end of the street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale and the rest were waiting for Ning Xiaoyao at the exit. He led his horse to meet them as they arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Windy, can I ride on your horse?” Shadowgale’s horse was a white stallion called Little White Dragon. There wasn’t a stray hair on his body, and he’d caught Ning Xiaoyao’s girlish heart as soon as she left the palace. A white horse! </span><i><span style>It’d be so romantic riding a white horse through the city streets!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Before Shadowgale could answer, Lou Zigui whipped Little Red, who whinnied and sprinted away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dangit,” Ning Xiaoyao twisted her body to look back, nearly falling off the horse. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui pulled her towards him and said, “You don’t want to ride on my horse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shot a glance at the galloping Little Red. In order to spare the horse’s feelings, she lied and said, “I’m willing.” </span><i><span style>Everyone’s heard of a prince on a white horse, but never a prince on a red one! </span></i><span style>She was unhappy. (</span><i><span style>Author: Enough already…</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come in a bit closer,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao leaned in closer to Lou Zigui. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“When you go out in the rain next time, remember to use an umbrella,” Lou Zigui urged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao asked, “Even when riding a horse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then wear a rain cape.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When we return to the palace, I’ll go interrogate Yan Hong at the Hall of Punishment. You should go back and rest early.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui glanced down at the person in his arms. “Did you forget that we have a great assembly tomorrow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stiffened. </span><i><span style>Another great assembly?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Tomorrow morning at court, remember to--”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Coughcoughcough,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao hacked. “I’m sick, can I skip the assembly tomorrow?” She had to make sure Qin Xuan and Miss A’Xin left the capital city quickly. Moreover, there were other things to take care of too, like Little Peach Blossom and news of Supreme Commander’s big brother. She was really busy, so who had time to sit in that hall and listen to Elder Li and company’s verbal spars? More than that was the fact that she didn’t want to see him at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui raised a hand to feel Ning Xiaoyao’s forehead, which was cool to the touch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Cough, cough,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao kept coughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Lou Zigui said, “Then issue an imperial decree dismissing the assembly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stopped coughing immediately. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She’s just a girl, so how can she really be emperor? </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui told himself. A day without assembly should be fine, since the previous emperor had missed his sessions for years. He didn’t lose his kingdom anymore for it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander, you think Xie Anshi will fight another round with those Luo brothers?” Ning Xiaoyao stroked Oil Jar in her sleeve, now that she was out of danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Luo brothers wouldn’t dare to a second time,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Aye,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao dragged out a sigh. </span><i><span style>It looks like my skills at sowing discord still suck too much. </span></i><span style>She had to practice more!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the steward of the estate they just left pressed the switch to check on the contents of the secret chamber. Then he withdrew the 5,000 taels from the empress dowager and reported to the Grand Preceptor, “Grand Preceptor, there wasn’t anything missing from the secret storage area. Here’s the silver that Esteemed Empress Dowager prepared for eldest young master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave it here,” the Grand Preceptor tapped the desk. The steward did as he was told and left the room. Grand Preceptor shot a glance at his sorry-looking son, Xie Anshi, before rising to his feet and walking to the Luo brothers. “Lou Zigui is a cunning and crafty man. Nephews-in-law, you’ll need to take great care when facing him in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” the Luo brothers hastened to answer. Grand Preceptor Xie next called up Xie Anshi before slapping him soundly across his bruised and swollen face. Xie Anshi had lost his temper at the Luo brothers, but he didn’t utter a word at his father’s slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yan Hong?” Grand Preceptor Xie questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anshi knelt down. “Father, your son has been wronged.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then all the eyes in the courtyard saw the wrong thing?” Grand Preceptor Xie asked coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anshi said, “Yan Hong suddenly fell over, so your son only moved to hold her up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impudence!” Grand Preceptor Xie raged. “Yan Hong is part of the poison sect. Her martial arts skills are top-notch, so how could she simply topple over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anshi was left gaping at the revelation. </span><i><span style>Wasn’t Yan Hong simply a toy of Xie Laibao’s? </span></i><span style>She was even part of the poison sect and armed with formidable fighting prowess?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder Luo brother bowed towards Grand Preceptor Xie. “Grand Preceptor, if there’s nothing else, this one and Luo Rui will withdraw.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You two can return to the barracks,” Grand Preceptor Xie’s expression warmed at the sight of Luo Wei. Politely, he said, “I’ve troubled you brothers to make a trip tonight. You’ve worked hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Luo Rui left Fragrant Gauze Alley with his older brother, he couldn’t help but ask, “What did the Grand Preceptor’s words mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Wei replied, “The Grand Preceptor is telling us that woman isn’t someone ordinary. Even if she has something going on with Xie Anshi, it’s only because of lust and won’t affect his status.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Rui wanted to curse, but held back his temper at the sight of the soldiers and horses following behind them. His elder brother suddenly smiled and murmured, “But Lou Zigui was able to capture such a formidable woman. There should be a show to see very soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother?” Second Young Master Luo didn’t understand. </span><i><span style>Just whose side is big brother on anyways?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s definitely a ceremonial hall in that estate,” Eldest Young Master Luo said, “But it has nothing to do with us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Rui shook his head. He couldn’t help but feel that his brother had a falling out with the Grand Preceptor. The rain had turned Luo Wei’s complexion ghastly pale. </span><i><span style>A good bird chooses the branch on which it perches. If the Xie Clan ever falls, our Luo Clan cannot die with them. A single little sister is too insignificant when compared to the fate of our clan. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Useless!” In the study, Grand Preceptor Xie kicked the kneeling Xie Anshi in the chest, knocking him to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anshi clutched his heart and cried in an aggrieved tone, “Father, Lou Zigui suddenly brought imperial guards to charge into the courtyard. How could your son stop him with just a few men?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie rested his hand against his bandaged head. Right now, he was still feeling woozy and nauseous enough to throw up. If Ning Xiaoyao was here, she’d be able to tell him that these were aftereffects of a concussion. Xie Anshi crawled to his knees and knelt before Grand Preceptor Xie anew. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father, all the people in the basement are dead. Your son’s already counted the bodies. Their faces are all ruined now, so even if Lou Zigui takes them away, I don’t think it’ll matter much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie backed up a few steps until he was sitting in his chair. “You didn’t miscount?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your son wouldn’t miscount,” Xie Anshi shuffled forward on his knees. “Your son doesn’t dare to miscount. I even looked at every one of the bodies, there can be no mistake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie hammered the armrest. </span><i><span style>So that means Lou Zigui’s trip tonight was in vain?</span></i></p>
