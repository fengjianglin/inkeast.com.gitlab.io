 <p><span style>“We can’t afford to make any mistakes right now,” Lou Zigui pinched Ning Xiaoyao’s face at the sight of her bitter expression. “Nothing will happen to the empress.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And suppose the empress doesn’t become bad guy buddies with the empress dowager?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui smiled. “Then wouldn’t that be an even better outcome?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pursed her lips. She couldn’t out talk this black belly, how depressing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take me to see Xie Anji,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pointed with her finger. “He’s over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Lou Zigui pulled at Ning Xiaoyao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the two of them about to leave, Yan Hong quickly spoke up. “Your Majesty, what about those men from the Grand Preceptor’s estate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Send them off to work in the mines!” Ning Xiaoyao cut off Lou Zigui’s words. </span><i><span style>Everyone’s human here. Do we need to be so ruthless and kill them off all the time?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked once more at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think Regional Commander Qin needs more manpower over there,” Ning Xiaoyao said seriously. “These men might be reformed through hard labor once they’re far away from the Grand Preceptor’s poisonous influence. Maybe they’ll even improve?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell is ‘reformed through hard labor?’ </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui felt another headache coming on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander agrees,” Ning Xiaoyao told Yan Hong when Lou Zigui didn’t speak. “Send them off to work in the mines.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yan Hong glanced at Lou Zigui, her eyes seductive as always. </span><i><span style>Do His Majesty’s words need Supreme Commander’s permission before they pass through?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ah geez, those charming eyes of her again. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sniffed, before turning to walk towards Shadowgale and the rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you think of bringing those two from the Poison Sect with you?” Lou Zigui asked as he followed behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander, is a girl like Miss Yan Hong excellent in your eyes?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>Are we even talking about the same thing?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ning Xiaoyao recalled the beauty Yan Hong’s gaze just then, she tried to imitate the same look at Lou Zigui. “Supreme Commander, do you feel anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui raised a hand to cover Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes. “What’s wrong with your eyes? Are they hurting?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After some thought, Lou Zigui removed his hand and bent down to look carefully at Ning Xiaoyao’s face in the moonlight. “Did you get some sand in them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>(⊙︿⊙), went Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>It’s no good, I can’t have my fun anymore.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No sand,” Lou Zigui said as he brushed carefully through Ning Xiaoyao’s eyelids with a murmur. “What’s wrong with your eyes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao slapped Lou Zigui’s hand aside and start walking forward. “Don’t talk to me, I’m very grief-stricken right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because of the empress’s affairs?” Lou Zigui asked. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Pah!” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao spat furiously. “I’m not her man, so why would I be depressed for her sake? Moreover, she already has a child, while I have nothing!” </span><i><span style>If you compare yourself to others, you’ll anger yourself to death. Who’s in a worse state than me right now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s face reddened at that. </span><i><span style>This girl wants to have my children? </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Cough, cough, the two of you are thinking about completely different things, ah!</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph!” Ning Xiaoyao huffed and sped up her steps, feeling more grieved by the second. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A Dragon Guard quietly asked Shadowgale, “His Majesty and Supreme Commander are arguing over the sake of a woman now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Shadowgale could reply, another guard asked, “Which woman could that be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale only knitted his brows. “Isn’t it easy enough for His Majesty to get a child?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone agreed with the Head Commander’s words. His Majesty could have all the women he wanted, so what was so hard about having children?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Was Supreme Commander trying to introduce a married woman with children to His Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible if she’s married. Maybe he meant a widow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guards gossiped amongst themselves, none of them understanding exactly what His Majesty and Supreme Commander had been arguing about. The Poison Sect Head only felt himself suffering after hearing their words. </span><i><span style>Why are the so called mysterious, cold-blooded, killing machines of the imperial Ning Clan a bunch of addled-brained weirdos? </span></i><span style>His impression of them had been thoroughly destroyed, leaving him with only inexpressible feelings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao could clearly hear her Dragon Guards talking amongst themselves. She wiped a hand across her face and began to worry for their sake. </span><i><span style>Their IQ doesn’t feel quite normal. They were perfectly fine a moment ago, but what’s wrong with them now? Anyone who spends time with someone as dashing as the Heavens like me should grow more and more dashing themselves! </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Enough, you…</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui saw multiple eyes sneaking glances his way and simply headed for Xie Anji, who was still unconscious. The man’s complexion was gray and he looked half-dead. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He fainted?” Lou Zigui asked the Dragon Guard standing watch over him,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-it was His Majesty who kicked him,” the guard replied hastily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui nodded. </span><i><span style>That’s certainly Miss Ning’s style, all right.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It was mostly the Sect Head’s work,” Ning Xiaoyao walked over with her hands behind her back while clicking her tongue. “Sect Head, you were too brutal on him. I don’t think the Grand Preceptor will forgive you after this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sect Head didn’t want to say a word. </span><i><span style>Isn’t this exactly what you wanted?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Very good,” Lou Zigui quietly praised Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A smug Ning Xiaoyao replied, “Typically speaking, people about my height are rarely a match for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sect Head clenched his fists, but once he remembered that this was His Majesty, impervious to hundreds of poisons, he decided to endure it instead. Lou Zigui wanted to raise a hand and pat Ning Xiaoyao on the head, but realized everyone was watching. He withdrew his hand and said instead, “Even those taller than Your Majesty aren’t your match.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao grew more smug as her eyes swept over the assembled men. All of the Dragon Guards lowered their heads, not wanting to participate in this conversation. The Sect Head spoke up wickedly, “Then what about you, Supreme Commander?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whaa?” Ning Xiaoyao pulled Lou Zigui behind her to glare at the Sect Head. “Forget about the fact that you’re only as tall as me, why are you so petty as well? You’re supposed to be a man! I’ve broken off relations with you and the Grand Preceptor, so now you’re sowing discord between me and Supreme Commander? Do you think you’ll get any taller after Supreme Commander and I fight a round?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a second, the Sect Head entertained the thought of a full-on brawl with this wretch. </span><i><span style>We’re both men and about the same height, but he only minds the fact that I’m short, not him? </span></i><span style>&nbsp;He told himself to bear with it before saying, “How could Supreme Commander ever have the nerve to contest against you, Your Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wore a </span><i><span style>do-you-think-I’m-an-idiot </span></i><span style>expression as she shot back, “How are Supreme Commander and I supposed to know who’s the stronger one unless we fight a round?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sect Head revealed a </span><i><span style>so-you-really-are-an-idiot </span></i><span style>expression. </span><i><span style>You’re the emperor. Do you think Lou Zigui would really fight you? That’d just be labelled as attempted rebellion on his end!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“A person like you,” Ning Xiaoyao continued as she pointed at the Sect Head, “Has spent too much time with the Grand Preceptor. Your own humanity’s been infected by his.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Sect Head didn’t quite understand what being infected with humanity meant, he knew His Majesty was cursing him out. Lou Zigui took this chance to speak. “The Sect Head should deliver Xie Anji to Prince Fu. Before Tao Yu and Prince Fu leave the capital, you’ll be in charge of standing guard over him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful when the Grand Preceptor sends men to rescue his son,” Ning Xiaoyao reminded with a grin.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Grand Preceptor’s no hero, but are these two any better? </span></i><span style>The Sect Head felt suffocated by their words, but could only obey the commands. He also came to realize a truth: it was just as hard to follow a master like Ning Xiaoyao as it was to follow the Grand Preceptor. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sect Head and Yan Hong left with a group of Dragon Guards and the unconscious Xie Anji in tow. Meanwhile, Shadowgale took another Dragon Guard contingent to bring the rest of the Grand Preceptor’s men to the palace first. Lou Zigui was left standing in the empty streets, looking in the direction of Iron Buddha Temple. He asked Ning Xiaoyao in a quiet voice, “Shall I help you slip into Iron Buddha Temple for a look?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rolled her eyes as she stared at the sky. “Just to see how the empress will hate my guts after I ‘killed’ Zhou </span><i><span style>mama? </span></i><span style>And listen to how she’ll curse me to a miserable death? Am I mental? Do I have to abuse myself that much?” Besides, Big Boss Black had already gone there in her place, so why did she have to make herself unhappy in his place?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s mouth twitched. “You said it yourself, the empress might not fall for the trick or team up with the empress dowager.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s one possibility out of three,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “How are you so sure we won’t run into the second or the third?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three possibilities?” Lou Zigui asked. “Besides accepting or refusing an alliance with the empress dowager, what other choice is there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The last one would be that the empress can’t take the shock and commits suicide, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui felt like he shouldn’t have asked the question at all. </span><i><span style>Why would the empress kill herself when she’s still pregnant with Xu Feiyu’s child?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go home,” Ning Xiaoyao bent down to pick up Little White Fatty. “I want to sleep---literally have a sleep, like the noun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui watched as Ning Xiaoyao fed an apple to Little White Fatty and asked, “What does ‘noun’ mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “To have a sleep in the noun sense means to just lie under the covers and actually sleep, snores and all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there any other meaning to ‘sleep?’” Lou Zigui still ended up asking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao suddenly broke into a series of coarse chuckles before she rose up on her tiptoes to whisper in Lou Zigui’s ear. “The other is the verb form. That’s where people tumble in the sheets. The two of us, ah, when we…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui carefully pushed Ning Xiaoyao back on her heels before resting a hand against his forehead. “Alright, I understand now. You don’t need to say any more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shrugged. “Windy brought me here on his horse. Now that he’s gone ahead, can you bring me along instead, Supreme Commander?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui brought Ning Xiaoyao to Little Red, his expression a little tight. Once they reached the horse, he suddenly asked Ning Xiaoyao, “You don’t know how to ride horses?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urk, I </span><i><span style>should </span></i><span style>know,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. </span><i><span style>I can even hold conversations with them, so how hard is it to ask one to carry me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then ride on your own horse in the future,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I haven’t even found my own Little Ming yet,” Ning Xiaoyao tugged at Little Red’s mane, feeling sorry for the horse. Even now, she hadn’t found a mare for him yet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui mounted his horse and lightly pulled Ning Xiaoyao up after him. “The imperial stables have their share of good horses, I’ll go pick one out for you tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But aren’t we supposed to send off General Tao and the rest tomorrow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I still have enough time to pick a horse,” Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao towards him a bit. </span><i><span style>How can I keep letting Shadowgale take her on his horse? </span></i><span style>The very thought made him dejected. </span><i><span style>I should’ve picked a horse for her much earlier.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned back to look in the direction of Iron Buddha Temple one last time, hoping that the empress wouldn’t fall for the empress dowager’s tricks. </span><i><span style>But what if she does? </span></i><span style>She looked back at Lou Zigui, who was urging on their horse. </span><i><span style>For the sake of your true love, empress, don’t provoke Supreme Commander Lou. You have to rub your eyes and see clearly, ah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Aroo?” Little White Fatty looked up at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked back down. In the space of a few steps, the chubby wolf pup in her arms had completely polished off her giant apple!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao, don’t worry,” Little White Fatty stuck out his tongue to lick her hand. “I’ll protect you, arooo~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Just eat less in the future. You devoured that apple without even stopping to take breaths. If you keep up that appetite, I won’t be able to afford the cost of raising you!</span></i></p>
