 <p><span style>That night, rain fell in the capital again. The evening breeze also carried with it a chill rarely felt in late spring. Due to the national mourning period, none of the Grand Preceptor estate’s usual lamps were lit. The residence couldn’t be compared to the emperor’s Imperial Palace, but it was still one of the very best estates in the capital city. A night watchman sounded the call for the second watch[1. </span><i><span style>second watch </span></i><span style>(二更) - </span><i><span style>ergen, </span></i><span style>the second of five night watches, takes place from 21:00-23:00] as he walked past the Grand Preceptor’s estate, only to smell something burning. The night watchman hastily looked towards the estate and promptly dropped the gong in his hands. Frightened, he cried out, “Fire, the Grand Preceptor’s estate is on fire!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silent stillness of the rainy night was broken by the night watchman’s shouts. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Less than an hour later, the Grand Preceptor was sitting in an old-fashioned wooden armchair in an underground chamber of the estate, facing five men trussed up on a torture rack. Each of the men sported injuries on their bodies, while two of them had already lost consciousness. The head steward Xie Laibao ran briskly into the underground chamber and bent down to speak to Grand Preceptor Xie’s ear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grand Preceptor, the servants have put out the fires. Half of the storehouses were burnt down. The old madame had a scare, but her ladyship has already ordered someone to take the Grand Preceptor’s tag to invite an imperial physician from the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie sat there without saying a word. Xie Laibao retreated out of the room, his figure still bent over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Setting fires,” Grand Preceptor Xie said coldly as he looked at the five men on the racks. “Lou Zigui has truly toxic designs!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The three men who were still conscious on the racks showed no reaction to Grand Preceptor Xie’s words. The head guard standing by Grand Preceptor’s side said, “Grand Preceptor, are we still keeping these five men?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the victim of a house fire, how could Grand Preceptor Xie not harbor thoughts of killing these men? But he still shook his head at the guard. These men were Lou Zigui’s subordinates, so they were now collateral in his hands. Their lives would only be worth something if they weren’t dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s too good for them,” the head guard said resentfully. </span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the oil lamps in the basement burst into a shower of sparks with a </span><i><span style>pah. </span></i><span style>For the sake of the Imperial Jade Seal, the hereditary symbol of a country, Ning Yu and Lou Zigui were as anxious as dogs trying to jump over a wall. Of this, Grand Preceptor Xie was very clear in his heart. </span><i><span style>It’s just a pity, </span></i><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie grinned, </span><i><span style>That the Imperial Jade Seal isn’t in the Grand Preceptor’s estate.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The head guard couldn’t help but get goosebumps at the sight of that smile. </span><i><span style>Had the Grand Preceptor gone mad with anger? Half of his storerooms gone, how much money did the Xie Family lose in this fire? It’s like losing half a gold mountain at once, but His Excellency Grand Preceptor can still smile?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Laibao returned again to run to Grand Preceptor Xie’s side, bending over to say urgently, “Grand Preceptor, a eunuch arrived from the palace. Esteemed Empress Dowager wants to invite you there for a trip.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so flustered?” Grand Preceptor Xie looked coldly at his head steward. Why was this servant less and less able to endure such events? Of the six men in black, only one had escaped. Ning Yu and Lou Zigui must have gotten news of their missing men by now. Today, His Majesty had even gone to find Esteemed Empress Dowager and kick up a row. As Grand Preceptor Xie understood it, his eldest daughter must be summoning him to the palace for that affair. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Laibao slapped himself in the face before saying, “This servant deserves to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie rose to his feet and glanced at the five men on the racks one more time. He then ordered the head guard, “Have them write down their testimonies, but remember not to let them die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” the head guard obeyed in a loud voice. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie brought along Xie Laibao as he left the basement. When he recalled that he’d be facing off that local ruffian, the rascal Ning Yu again, his head suddenly began to ache. </span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Empress Dowager Xie had just about turned her bedroom upside down. She pulled everything off her bed onto the ground, even the mosquito net hanging over the bed. The rouge and face powder on her dressing table, along with her jewelry case, had all been knocked to the floor, filling the room with the scene of cosmetics. The wardrobe doors had been flung open, its neat, orderly, and folded clothes left in a messy pile. The end effect looked like someone had ransacked through the respectable empress dowager’s rooms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie fell back into her chair as words echoed in her head: </span><i><span style>The--imperial--jade--seal--was--gone! </span></i><span style>A few </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>and court ladies shook with fear as they guarded the door outside. After all the commotion by the empress dowager, they didn’t even dare to turn around and look inside. Outside in the courtyard, a few stewards and eunuchs also stood there helpless, their expressions nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After His Majesty left the empress dowager’s palace today, he skinned a young eunuch alive,” &nbsp;a steward whispered to his cohorts. “Is Esteemed Empress Dowager saddened for His Majesty’s sake again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other stewards and eunuchs stared at the speaker. </span><i><span style>He sure could talk. </span></i><span style>Why would the Esteemed Empress Dowager bother getting sad over an eunuch’s death. It was more likely that His Majesty had provoked her somehow again. (</span><i><span style>Author: All His Majesty did was perform a surgery to treat a little mouse. When did that turn into killing a young eunuch? Can’t these rumors be more reliable?</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Empress Dowager Xie was wondering where her Imperial Jade Seal was at the same time Ning Xiaoyao was pacing around in her room. Big Boss Black had left with Oil Lamp that afternoon to check out the Grand Preceptor’s secret grain depot. Now that it was dark, why hadn’t they come back yet? Just where did they go to find that grain depot? </span></p>
 <p><span style>The little gyrfalcon was getting dizzy from her pacing and said, “How about I go look for Big Boss Black and Oil Lamp?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head. “Don’t, I don’t want to lose you in the process too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do we do?” Oil Jar had already finished nibbling through half a sack of peanuts. “Oil Jar is anxious too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glanced at Oil Jar, who was nearly buried beneath empty peanut shells, and fell silent. </span><i><span style>Was this really someone who felt anxious?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how about letting my master look for them?” the little gyrfalcon suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t drag your master into this,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “What if Windy gets captured by the Grand Preceptor’s men? Forget it.” Her right hand formed into a fist and pounded into her left palm before Ning Xiaoyao came to a decision. “I’ll go look for them myself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miaow.” Big Boss Black’s meows came from the window just then. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dang! </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao hurried to open the window. </span><i><span style>This fat black furball’s finally come back. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black scurried up the window ledge, his fur all tangled up. He was covered in dust. “Xiaoyao,” Big Boss Black meowed, “The Grand Preceptor’s estate is on fire.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Whaa?”</span></i><span style> Ning Xiaoyao hastened to ask. “Did Grand Preceptor Xie burn to death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black scratched the back of Ning Xiaoyao’s hand with his claw. “What kind of good news are you hoping for? Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>’s </span></i><span style>men were captured by the Grand Preceptor. He told people to hit them and they were beaten terribly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was stunned. </span><i><span style>Another mishap! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black was impatient. “Xiaoyao, what do we do now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned on the spot and decided right then to find Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou. Currently, Lou Zigui had gotten the Dragon Guards to get him some hot water and taken off his clothes in his room. He was using a hand towel to wipe off his body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao slammed the door open and rushed directly into the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The naked Lou Zigui stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>it’s not good!” Ning Xiaoyao shouted. On her shoulders, Big Boss Black raised his paws to cover her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not allowed to look at the Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>’s </span></i><span style>body!” the cat cried.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ah, geez. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao threw the fat furball on her shoulders outside the room, too vexed to listen to him. </span><i><span style>Was he turning from a fanboy into an idiotic fanatic? </span></i><span style>Once again, Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou witnessed the sight of His Majesty tossing a cat away. He placed his towel on the edge of a washbasin and began to look for his clothes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao ran until she was standing right in front of Lou Zigui and said, “At a time like this, how could you still be in the mood to get dressed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” Lou Zigui was speechless. Was he supposed to stay naked without any clothes on? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gestured madly with her hands as she explained, “It’s no good, your people were captured by the Grand Preceptor. What should we do? Should we bring along Windy and the rest and slaughter our way to the estate and rescue them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who told Your Majesty this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Black Tubby, oh, that’s not it,” Ning Xiaoyao said, “Saving people is more important. Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>, </span></i><span style>don’t worry about who told me the news.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black began to cry out from outside the room. “It was this cat, this cat told her. Ninny, you’re blotting out my contributions in front of Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>. </span></i><span style>Miaow, you’re a scoundrel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!” Ning Xiaoyao shouted towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lou Zigui heard the cat outside stop meowing, he only said, “This cat listens to Your Majesty’s words rather well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m talking about saving people!” Ning Xiaoyao was so anxious that sweat had broken out on her forehead. “The important thing is rescuing them, rescuing them is more important, ah, </span><i><span style>geez!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand.” Ning Xiaoyao was making such a din in the middle of the night that Lou Zigui could already hear footsteps hurrying this way. He was quick to coax her. “You calm down first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can I calm down?” Ning Xiaoyao clutched her head and spun in place again. “The Grand Preceptor had them beaten, their bodies are covered in blood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s eyes dimmed. Of course he knew that Old Huo and the rest would suffer through torture, but he’d seem mountains of corpses and seas of blood ever since joining the army at twelve. Lou Zigui’s heart had long turned as cold as ice and as hard as iron. “They’re still alive, aren’t they?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised a hand to stroke Ning Xiaoyao’s head before putting on the clothes he’d left by the bed. By now, Ning Xiaoyao had realized one thing. If she already had the Imperial Jade Seal, why were the Supreme Commander</span><i><span style>’s </span></i><span style>men still running over to the Grand Preceptor’s estate? “You want,” Ning Xiaoyao asked Lou Zigui, whose back was to her as he got dressed, “You want to set a fire and burn the Grand Preceptor’s family to death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If that was possible, then Lou Zigui would do exactly that. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there something I don’t know?” Ning Xiaoyao ran to sit on Lou Zigui’s bed as she looked at him. “Tell me about it, or else I’ll just feel anxious. Then I won’t be able to fall asleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” Shadowgale’s voice called from outside the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui quickened his rate of dressing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here,” Ning Xiaoyao answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale stood outside the door and said, “The Grand Preceptor entered the palace and went to see the empress dowager.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s over,” Ning Xiaoyao jumped up and grabbed Lou Zigui’s hand. “That old geezer’s come to the palace to lodge a complaint.” Ning Xiaoyao’s action pulled down half of Lou Zigui’s clothes again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Windy, you don’t have to say another word. Find some men and come with me.” When she didn’t hear Lou Zigui’s reply, Ning Xiaoyao lost the patience to wait and went around him to run out. Those people had to be saved. As for why they’d set fire to the Grand Preceptor’s estate in the first place, that was something that could be asked about after the rescue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Shadowgale heard Ning Xiaoyao shout, he popped his head into the room and asked, “Where is Your Majesty going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To the Grand Preceptor’s estate,” Ning Xiaoyao replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said the Head Commander Shadowgale. </span><i><span style>His Majesty told me to gather the other fellows. Are we planning to kill the Grand Preceptor’s entire family while he’s out of the house?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Lou Zigui realized that Ning Xiaoyao was about to run out of the room, he caught up from behind and tried to grab her hand. When he missed, he could only wrap Ning Xiaoyao into a hug.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said the Head Commander Shaowgale. For some reason, it looked off when Supreme Commander</span> <span style>Lou hugged His Majesty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all right,” Lou Zigui told Shadowgale as he held onto Ning Xiaoyao. “I’m going to say a few words to His Majesty.” Shadowgale withdrew his head and even closed the door for Supreme Commander Lou. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not going to save them?” Ning Xiaoyao pushed aside Lou Zigui. She was very strong, so Lou Zigui had to stagger back three steps before he came to a stop. “Just what’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stared at Lou Zigui. If he couldn’t give her a satisfactory answer, then she’d, </span><i><span style>then she’d…</span></i><span style> Ning Xiaoyao thought it over before deciding that she’d definitely beat him up!</span></p>
