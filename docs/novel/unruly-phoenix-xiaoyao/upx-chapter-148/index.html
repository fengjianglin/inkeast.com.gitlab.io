 <p>Chapter&nbsp;148: His Majesty gets tricked&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I….I have little pals here,” Ning Xiaoyao could only mumble out after some thought. However, Lou Zigui hadn’t seen any person speak to Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Where are your so-called little pals?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it over now?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “How about we go home instead? Let them bury Old Madame first, maybe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui patted Ning Xiaoyao’s head before whispering a few things at a Dragon Guard behind him. Ning Xiaoyao’s sharp ears picked up Supreme Commander telling him that the men were in the northern courtyard, and to carry them over here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guard obeyed before running out of the room. Ning Xiaoyao glanced at Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>Those people already have broken bones galore. Isn’t it impossible to pin the crime on a bunch of crippled soldiers? </span></i><span style>The silence in the room remained unbroken until the sound of quick footsteps came their way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stopped breathing. </span><i><span style>It’s time!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Shadowgale’s voice sounded from outside. “We subordinates have captured seven men in the northern court of the estate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And I’ve already said, those are Xie Clan members!”Xie Anji said loudly from behind. When Ning Xiaoyao saw Lou Zigui and Grand Preceptor Xie both standing there without moving, Ning Xiaoyao leaped out of her chair and covered the distance to the door in just a few strides. She was far less patient than those two. Outside in the grassy courtyard, seven bloody men were lined up side by side. A doctor had already binded up their injuries under layers of thick bandages. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sized them up and ascertained that these were all of the seven men they’d wanted to capture. Not one of them had escaped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Shadowgale bowed, awaiting orders. Ning Xiaoyao was about to walk down the steps when Lou Zigui pulled her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are they?” Lou Zigui turned his head to ask Grand Preceptor Xie, who was just coming out himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re distance relatives of my Xie Clan,” Grand Preceptor Xie replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are they recorded in the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy_book" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>genealogy books</span></a><span style>?” Lou Zigui asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring the book,” Grand Preceptor Xie ordered Xie Anshi. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Holy crap, old geezer Xie even created fake records for them on short notice?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Soon enough, Xie Anshi arrived with the genealogy book and handed them over to Lou Zigui. Ning Xiaoyu stuck her head in to look, but didn’t understand the contents. She lowered her voice and murmured, “Are there any problems with it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None,” Lou Zigui said as he closed the book again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Well, then. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at Grand Preceptor Xie, thoroughly convinced that they’d lost. </span><i><span style>Even if we can’t hold onto those guys, we can still keep hold on our dignity. </span></i><span style>“Grand Preceptor, you sure have a lot of relatives.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie’s tone was full of respect. “Your Majesty, the Xie Clan has only grown in the past few centuries. Our sons and grandsons have prospered thanks to the late emperor and Your Majesty’s grace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pursed her lips. </span><i><span style>What does your Xie Clan birth rate have to do with the likes of me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why were they injured?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lou Zigui,” Xie Anshi said bluntly, “Are you interrogating my father?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What impudence!” Elder Li cried. “Xie Anshi, you’re only a minister at the Ministry of Civil Personnel. What right do you have to call Supreme Commander Lou by his full name”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m only protecting father, since when did I---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That there, his upbringing was lacking,” Ning Xiaoyao cut in. “Old gramps, don’t get mad. Even Supreme Commander’s ignoring him, see?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the courtyard looked towards Xie Anshi. After His Majesty had called the eldest young master a bastard, now Third Young Master Xie was someone brought up with a poor education. If Grand Preceptor Xie couldn’t endure past this trial, then it’d be a pipe dream for this generation of Xie Clan men to hold government posts and command the courts like their forefathers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anshi looked at Ning Xiaoyao, dearly wanting to flip out. But he held his temper in check and felt miserable instead. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“They met with the mobs in the capital,” Grand Preceptor Xie explained. “And were attacked by them in turn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see calluses on their hands,” Lou Zigui said. “The kind you get from frequent use of bows or other weapons. They’re familiar with those, but they couldn’t fight off a mob of civilians?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie replied, “There wasn’t enough time to retaliate, so these serious injuries are excusable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“True enough,” Lou Zigui nodded, before looking suspiciously at the seven men. “What’s the relationship between you seven? Friends?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao listened ignorantly, completely unaware of the trap set in Lou Zigui’s words. Grand Preceptor Xie furtively shook his head at the men. There was no way they could claim to being friends, because they were already “relatives” of the Xie Clan. How could family members say they were friends stead?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seven military officials had all taken painkillers, but the side effects of such drugs was to making them slow and sluggish. An alert and focused mind would have no way to ignore the pain from such injuries. Because of that, the seven men were feeling a little slow in their heads as well, and unconsciously nodded to Lou Zigui’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li barked out a cold laugh. Grand Preceptor Xie’s expression remained unchanged. “They’ve grown up together since childhood, so they’re family as well as friends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gaped at Grand Preceptor Xie. </span><i><span style>You can even turn the tides at a time like this?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Search them,” Lou Zigui said coldly. A few Dragon Guards stepped forward and started frisking the seven men. Xie Anshi made a placating motion to Grand Preceptor Xie, indicating that it’d be alright. All seven men had been changed into new clothes already, and the poison in the planted bottle had long been replaced with a copy. At this moment, Cousin Magpie flew into the courtyard with a tiny white bottle between his beak. Cousin Magpie’s wife was resting in her nest, and glanced at the bottle her husband tossed by her feet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this? Can we eat it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cousin Magpie replied, “The men that Xiaoyao want to capture changed their clothes. This bottle was hidden in one of their robes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it useful to Xiaoyao?” Cousin Magpie’s wife asked in a rush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know, ah,” Cousin Magpie shook his head. “There were men guarding the pile of discarded clothes. When I flew in the window to take this bottle, they almost discovered me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How heroic was it to steal things from human claws right under their noses? Cousin Magpie’s wife looked at her husband with admiring eyes. (</span><i><span style>Author: &nbsp;Hey, humans claws are called hands!</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should I do?” Cousin Magpie asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Deliver it to Xiaoyao, ah,” his wife replied. “Suppose she needs it? But if she doesn’t and it’s edible, you can bring it back to us.” She had always been a magpie good at planning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That courtyard’s full of humans. Should I toss the bottle at Xiaoyao’s head?” Cousin Magpie asked uneasily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now his wife thought he was foolish. “Can’t you call Xiaoyao out of the courtyard? It’s not like the other humans can understand you, </span><i><span style>pah!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly seeing the light, Cousin Magpie picked up the bottle in his mouth and flew off again. Currently, one of the Dragon Guards in Old Madame’s courtyard had found a bottle in the folds of one man’s clothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hold it,” Grand Preceptor Xie called out before the Dragon Guard gave the bottle to Lou Zigui. “Let this old man have a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui nodded towards the guard, who handed the bottle over. Grand Preceptor Xie examined the object before asking, “Supreme Commander, what do you think is in this bottle?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Xie Wenyuan could order these men to be beaten, wouldn’t he order their clothes to be searched as well? Lou Zigui was now very clear that the white bottle in his hands wasn’t the poison at all. Perhaps it was wine or even clear water. However, he still had two bottles of the same poison hidden in his sleeve. His next goal was to somehow find a link between his poisons and those seven men. It would be easy to fabricate something when his targets were lying right there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Supreme Commander Lou knew exactly how things stood, Ning Xiaoyao was completely clueless. When she heard Grand Preceptor Xie’s question and saw the bottle, she assumed it was the one that Supreme Commander had handed off to Shadowgale. In that case, she proclaimed, “It might even be poison!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because she spoke too quickly, Lou Zigui didn’t have time to stop her. Grand Preceptor Xie looked at her and asked, “Your Majesty, they’re members of the Xie Clan as well. What motive would they have to hurt Old Madame?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Xie Anshi’s prodding, the seven men all starting crying out for injustice. Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her nose. “I’m not the one who wanted to kill her. I don’t know these men either, so how am I supposed to guess their motives?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie said, “Then what if there isn’t poison in this bottle?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then I’ll admit that you’re the stronger one and go home to eat, wash up, and sleep! </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought privately, but said out loud, “Then we’ll keep searching for the culprit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Lou Zigui spoke up, since it was useless to pull her back now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander Lou,” Grand Preceptor Xie said, “Don’t stand in for Your Majesty for every little thing. You’re only a subject, so you should act the part.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “What are you wasting words for? Hurry up and test it for poison.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rested his forehead against his hand. Grand Preceptor Xie said, “Your Majesty, this subject believes that they had no intention to hurt the Old Madame.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I firmly believe that they’re guilty,” Ning Xiaoyao refused to accept his claim. “How do you know what’s in that bottle unless you test it first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie sucked in a breath. Ning Xiaoyao continued, “There’s no need to find a test subject. Just pour some on the ground and see what happens. If the poison’s corrosive enough to burn the tea table, it’ll probably react against dirt, too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If there’s no poison in the bottle, can Your Majesty restore their innocence?” Grand Preceptor Xie asked with the bottle in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao sensed that something was amiss. </span><i><span style>Why is this old man feeling so confident? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie opened the bottle and poured some of its contents on the ground. No reaction came from the dirt. Next, he took a sip of the liquid and told Ning Xiaoyao, “Your Majesty, this bottle contains nothing but hard liquor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the smell of white wine was filling the air now as Ning Xiaoyao realized she’d been tricked. Grand Preceptor Xie walked back to the walkway and stood there to show that he was unharmed, before saying respectfully, “Your Majesty, can you restore these men’s innocence now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” Ning Xiaoyao said. </span><i><span style>What should I do now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie said, “Although they’re only commoners, they have filial piety as well. This subject asks that Your Majesty restore their innocence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao could only mutter awkwardly, “The way you’re saying things makes me sound like a bad guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This subject wouldn’t dare,” Grand Preceptor Xie hastened to say. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Big Boss Black, who was squatting by Ning Xiaoyao’s side, couldn’t be bothered with keeping up appearances in front of his Supreme Commander anymore. He clawed Ning Xiaoyao and meowed, “You ninny, miaow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao only looked helplessly at Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>Can we still salvage the situation? </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui’s expression hadn’t changed much. He went to order the Dragon Guards, “Keep searching, but be more detailed this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said the Dragon Guards. </span><i><span style>They’ve already changed the bottles, so what are we supposed to find?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao!” Cousin Magpie’s call came from outside the courtyard. “Xiaoyao, hurry and come out, I have something for you~”</span><i></i></p>
