 <p>Chapter&nbsp;185: This subject knows who the culprit is&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Ning Xiaoyao was suppressing her urge to kill Grand Preceptor Xie, Lou Zigui took that time and spoke up. “This one understands the Grand Preceptor’s views as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing those words from </span><i><span style>that</span></i><span style> man, Grand Preceptor Xie’s eyes flashed. “Your Majesty, this subject is ill. Please pardon this subject for not seeing you off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao away, but she refused to leave without resolving the troubles of A’Mo and the rest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lou Zigui tugged on her, she simply stood in place and asked, “Do you insist on doing things this way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie didn’t even open his eyes. “This subject still has the same words: </span><i><span style>does Your Majesty want this subject dead?”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Would you die if I tell you to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To which Grand Preceptor Xie replied, “This subject has no choice if the sovereign wants the subject dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao immediately replied, “Then fine, you can go die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, the mountains and rivers are in tatters while bandits roam the lands. Your Majesty is haunted by petty subjects by your side,” Grand Preceptor Xie continued. “Due to current circumstances, this subject cannot die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao smoothed down her sleeves and suddenly lost all her patience. She was going to sic this bastard.</span><i><span style> How could he say such righteous-sounding words when he was absolutely shameless himself?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty!” Lou Zigui grabbed Ning Xiaoyao once again and shook his head at her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao held herself back and said to the Grand Preceptor, “Why don’t you say who those supposedly petty subjects are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie simply stared at Lou Zigui. Ning Xiaoyao glanced at him and said, “Supreme Commander, you still want me to hold back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Justice is apparent in one’s heart,” Lou Zigui replied coldly, causing Grand Preceptor Xie to bark out a sarcastic laugh. By now, all of the doctors had backed up right next to the windows. In the Grand Preceptor’s eyes, His Majesty wasn’t a sovereign at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can still laugh even when you’re swollen like this,” Ning Xiaoyao gave Grand Preceptor Xie a thumbs up. “No wonder people always say </span><i><span style>‘good people never live long, but evil jerks live on forever.’”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie moved his neck with some difficulty to stare at Lou Zigui. “What Your Majesty means to say is while the Xie Clan’s full of loyal martyrs, Supreme Commander is the sole survivor of his family?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Aiya, </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought as she stared at Grand Preceptor Xie, </span><i><span style>He’s classifying Supreme Commander as one of those ‘evil jerks,’ </span></i><span style>“Grand Preceptor, your brains have turned useless with your advanced years, is that it?” Ning Xiaoyao said. “The Lou Clan still has a little nephew named Lou Nan.[1. </span><i><span style>Lou Nan </span></i><span style>(楼楠) - </span><i><span style>Nan </span></i><span style>is the name of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_zhennan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style>Phoebe zhennan</span></i></a> <span style>tree, whose wood was so valuable that only the imperial family could use it.] How could you ignore the existence of such a living, breathing Lou Clan member?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie laughed coldly. “Lou Nan has been weak and sickly since childhood---”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough,” Ning Xiaoyao didn’t let Grand Preceptor Xie finish his nasty words. “You had three perfectly healthy sons, but was that any use? One’s been wasted, one’s an idiot, and the last---oh, that’s right, I forgot to ask. Is your third son still struggling for life in this world?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie finally fell silent. Ning Xiaoyao silently gave herself a </span><i><span style>‘Like.’ </span></i><span style>Anyone who tried to verbally spar with her would experience a life worse than death, even if there were no zombies in this world! She’d definitely drive Grand Preceptor Xie to a dead end! In the past, anyone who faced off against her ended up being gnawed by zombies. (</span><i><span style>Author: Enough already…</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao away. If this kept on, she’d probably start shouting abuses in public again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you still going to capture the ants?” Ning Xiaoyao asked loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie only took her to be mocking him. He chortled, then said, “This subject already found the culprit, so why would I blame ants for these things? Or does Your Majesty wish for this subject to make mortal enemies out of some puny ants?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Whaa? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was a little lost. </span><i><span style>Aren’t A’Mo’s team of ants the culprits? Where did this ‘other suspect’ pop out from?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Grand Preceptor Xie stared at Ning Xiaoyao. “Don’t take this subject for an idiot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao creased her brows and considered the situation before her. </span><i><span style>Forget about who the Grand Preceptor’s suspecting, at least A’Mo and the rest are safe now, so I’ve reached my goal. </span></i><span style>Once she thought it through, Ning Xiaoyao relaxed her brows and nodded. “You’re not stupid,” she said. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If he really was stupid, would I have so much trouble killing him up to now? That’d only mean I was the low IQ one instead.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie said, “This subject thanks Your Majesty for the compliment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re welcome,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Treat your illness well, we can fight again when you recover. Goodbye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was already walking towards the door when Lou Zigui gave a parting word, “I beseech Grand Preceptor think twice before taking any actions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie blinked. Lou Zigui said no more, but turned and left as well. Ning Xiaoyao was standing outside the study doors to lecture Xie Anji. “There are so many rooms in the Grand Preceptor’s estate, but you let your father sleep in a study? Where’s your sense of filial piety?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji heaved for breath as he stared at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m asking you, is the study a room to read books or a room to sleep in?” Ning Xiaoyao curled her lips in contempt. “You unfilial son.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Grand Preceptor’s people wanted to kneel in awe before Ning Xiaoyao. It was common for the Grand Preceptor to sleep in the study, so was His Majesty kicking up a row on purpose? The eldest young master was a bastard who abandoned his first wife, the third young master was cold-blooded bastard who treated human life like garbage, and now His Majesty wanted to accuse their second young master as an unfilial bastard, too?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You just wait,” Ning Xiaoyao told Xie Anji, “If this happens again and I catch you mistreating the Grand Preceptor, I’ll definitely, that there, drown you in a wicker basket!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Your Majesty!” </span></i><span style>Xie Anji exclaimed out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said everyone else. </span><i><span style>His Majesty’s even saying things like drowning people in wicker baskets, how did his tongue turn so poisonous? That </span></i><a href="http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art49165.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style>kind of punishment </span></i></a><i><span style>is only reserved for married women who’ve committed adultery, so what does it mean when he puts it on second young master’s head?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop shouting,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “Even if you do, I’ll still drown you in a wicker basket.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Xie Anji lost all reason and started a verbal spar against Ning Xiaoyao, Lou Zigui walked out with a cold look towards the man. “Your Majesty, is there anything else you wanted to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing else,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Where’s the old madame’s mourning hall? Second Xie, lead the way. I’m going to burn some incense and papers and whatnot for old madame.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Grand Preceptor estate’s people wanted to cry. </span><i><span style>He’s not even sparing the old madame’s mourning hall?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Escort the guests out!” Grand Preceptor Xie yelled from the study. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui tugged at Ning Xiaoyao because it </span><i><span style>was</span></i><span style> about time they left. If they really forced Xie Wenyuan into ordering the capital soldiers to revolt, wouldn’t everything be over? Ning Xiaoyao was pulled toward the front gates of the Grand Preceptor’s estate as she made a </span><i><span style>‘nailed it’ </span></i><span style>gesture to Cousin Magpie on the roof.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cousin Magpie said, “Xiaoyao, if anything else happens, I’ll find you at the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao blew a kiss at him. Cousin Magpie was no romantic, but he sensed that Ning Xiaoyao was telling him </span><i><span style>‘alright,’ </span></i><span style>so he chirped back a few times before flying to A’Mo’s nest. He told the heroes who’d bitten Grand Preceptor Xie all over that the emergency had been resolved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s A’Mo?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, A’Mo’s alright now,” Ning Xiaoyao replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m asking you who he is, not if he’s alright,” Lou Zigui murmured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urk, A’Mo’s a little ant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stopped and turned to look at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Ning Xiaoyao knew Supreme Commander wouldn’t believe her. “A’Mo’s one of my little pals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Lou Zigui’s mind, this A’Mo had to be one of Ning Xiaoyao’s agents at the Grand Preceptor’s estate. (</span><i><span style>Author: Supreme Commander, you’re right in everything but the species.</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty?” one of the Dragon Guards ran out from the back courtyards of the Grand Preceptor’s estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Withdraw the men, we’re going back to the palace,” Ning Xiaoyao said. The Dragon Guard nodded and ran off. Ning Xiaoyao was dragged by Lou Zigui all the way to the exit. The servants there felt their legs quaking at the mere sight of her, feeling that anything could go wrong. By now, the Lord Protector had finally arrived with his own guards to the area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Protector, should we dismount from the horses?” a guard asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector stared at the newly renovated archway above them before whipping his horse to pass right through. Seeing this, his guards followed suit. Ning Xiaoyao stood at the entrance of the Grand Preceptor’s estate and looked left and right. Every time her gaze swept over someone, they would lower their heads and pretend they were invisible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This door,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she patted one of the </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%E9%97%A8%E9%92%89+%E5%8F%A4%E9%A3%8E&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=rimg:CQRThkrGHLacIjj5RObSrTjHFvr9fjzi8okdt29IzAtyUmAynPGtXFUwtz9GQ2XuTNwUX9VyhcieDCBIowZLjJWNCyoSCflE5tKtOMcWEQF8ijBGCDgtKhIJ-v1-POLyiR0Riwuoxdy9sKwqEgm3b0jMC3JSYBFfLJr2wXmX0yoSCTKc8a1cVTC3EaD09DqoVH8_1KhIJP0ZDZe5M3BQR-Il6zApD_1R0qEglf1XKFyJ4MIBGAb_16yrQfodyoSCUijBkuMlY0LEc8ihevAcn_18&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi_x_WZu8vaAhWwl-AKHTlQBlQQ9C96BAgAEBs&amp;biw=1218&amp;bih=781&amp;dpr=1.8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>round metal decorations</span></a><span style> on the door, “Is simply too ugly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Grand Preceptor’s servants felt their hearts rise up in their throats. Ning Xiaoyao banged against the door with effort and managed to topple it to the ground again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said the Grand Preceptor’s servants. </span><i><span style>As expected, His Majesty can’t leave without tearing something down at the estate.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stepped forward and took Ning Xiaoyao’s hand. “Does it hurt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Grand Preceptor’s servants looked at the toppled door and felt that it probably hurt more than His Majesty. The Lord Protector first heard the door crashing to the ground before he reached the Grand Preceptor’s estate. By the time he got to the front doors, Ning Xiaoyao was standing on top of the fallen door. In that moment, the Lord Protector believed in the old madame’s words. His Majesty wouldn’t lose---His Majesty would definitely play that old hooligan, Xie Wenyuan, to death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?” Ning Xiaoyao grinned at the Lord Protector. “Lord Protector, why did you come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector flipped off his horse, but Ning Xiaoyao had already run to his side. “Lord Protector, your little brother…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui caught up and pulled her aside before lowering his voice. “Talk about that after we’re farther away from </span><i><span style>this</span></i><span style> place..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned back and saw the Grand Preceptor’s servants hastily drop their heads, again pretending they didn’t exist. Lou Zigui brought Ning Xiaoyao and the Lord Protector some ways away from the Grand Preceptor’s estate, then asked, “Is honorable little brother well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector hastened to kneel in front of Ning Xiaoyao, but Lou Zigui stopped him before the emperor could do it herself. “There’s no need for formalities here, we can just talk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector stared at Lou Zigui. He was kneeling for His Majesty, so why did Lou Zigui stop him? Ning Xiaoyao said, “Mm, judging from the fact that Lord Protector tried to thank me, honorable little brother is well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Joy flashed on the Lord Protector’s face before he cupped his fist in front of his chest. “Yes, Your Majesty. Pei Yan has really recovered.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s a pity, </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought to herself, </span><i><span style>I didn’t get to go to the Lord Protector’s estate last night and see for myself. &nbsp;</span></i><span style>But when she lifted her head to look at Lou Zigui, her lips split into a lecherous grin. </span><i><span style>Last night, Supreme Commander and I...heheheh, that really wasn’t bad, either.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said the Lord Protector. </span><i><span style>My little brother was the one who became a man last night, but why does His Majesty look like he enjoyed himself too?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao to stand behind him before intoning, “Congratulations.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector only felt that there was something off about this odd couple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Protector, why have you come?” Lou Zigui asked while keeping Ning Xiaoyao firmly out of sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector said, “I heard something happened to the Grand Preceptor?”</span></p>
