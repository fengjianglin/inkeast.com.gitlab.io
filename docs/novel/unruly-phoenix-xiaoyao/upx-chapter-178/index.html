 <p>Chapter&nbsp;178: Is it true love? Is it a personal enemy?&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao escorted the empress out of the palace at the northern gates. Although she knew the empress must have packed money in those bags of hers, she held back her pain to hand over two silver drafts of her own. “Be careful with everyone once you leave the palace, especially for the empress dowager. If you need anything, have Zhou </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>come back to find me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The empress nodded with a </span><i><span style>yes. </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao quickly glanced at the empress’s stomach before she waved at hand at Zhou </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>who was in charge of their little carriage. “Go on now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The single rider carriage quickly departed from the gates. The empress lifted her window curtains with her hand to peer back at the quickly shrinking palace. She had been a bird in a cage for so long that she suddenly want to jump for joy at this newfound freedom. Perhaps a smile or laugh would do as well, but what came out were tears instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Empress, sit tight,” Zhou </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>said, her face covered by a veil as she urged on the horses. “Don’t let anyone see you.” The palace was the empress dowager’s domain, but the capital city belonged to Grand Preceptor Xie. It would be best for people to learn of their travels as late as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the empress’s gaze settled on the slight figure standing just inside the palace gates. Her guilty conscience flared up momentarily before she released the curtains and settled back into the carriage. </span><i><span style>Don’t think about that anymore, </span></i><span style>Empress Zhou told herself. </span><i><span style>Between His Majesty and Xu Feiyu, I will always pick the latter.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar perched on Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder to watch the carriage disappear into the distance. “Will the empress be alright?” he asked Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’ll have her older brother by her side and track down her General Xu as well,” Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her nose as she murmured back. “Maybe she and her big brother will even run away tonight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar’s mouth opened wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She wants to escape?” Big Boss Black asked. “Then Xiaoyao, what will you do?” No matter how good the empress might be, Big Boss Black was still worried about Ning Xiaoyao. She was his number one priority after Supreme Commander Lou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao simply shrugged. “What else can I do? Announce that the empress died, of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar squeaked. “So you’ve already thought it through, Xiaoyao. How formidable!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao chuckled. Fake deaths and whatnot were plenty good as a verbal excuse. Although she’d just come up with the idea on the spot, challenges like this were still nothing to her. (</span><i><span style>Author: If that’s the case, then why did you only come up with the idea now…</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao hummed a tune as she personally shut the palace gates and glanced at the two imperial guards on duty. “What did you guys see just then?” she asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The empress hadn’t shown her face and stayed inside the carriage the entire time, while Zhou </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>had obscured her identity with a veil. The two imperial guards had only seen His Majesty hand over two silver drafts to the occupant of the carriage but not the identities of the travelers. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing,.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, this servant didn’t see a thing,” the two guards on duty replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then did you guys see me?” Ning Xiaoyao asked next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two imperial guards looked at the emperor before them. Most sovereigns were described with metaphors such as </span><i><span style>‘a green dragon on the left shoulder and a white tiger on the right,’ </span></i><span style>but their sovereign had a cat on his left shoulder and a mouse on his right. They weren’t even wondering why the cat hadn’t eaten the mouse yet because His Majesty’s current getup was truly an insult to his status.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, we servants didn’t see Your Majesty,” the imperial guards replied with a straight face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfied, Ning Xiaoyao asked one officer, “Little bro, what’s your name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The officer hastened to say, “To reply Your Majesty, this one’s surnamed Zhou. My full name is Zhou Mu.”[1. </span><i><span style>Zhou Mu </span></i><span style>(周木) - This is the same </span><i><span style>Zhou </span></i><span style>shared by the empress and Zhou </span><i><span style>mama, </span></i><span style>but it’s a common enough last name that he’s probably completely unrelated. </span><i><span style>Mu </span></i><span style>means ‘wood.’] </span><i><span style>Mu </span></i><span style>meant ‘wood.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re nothing like a blockhead,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she patted Zhou Mu’s shoulders while thinking of his name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Mu only trembled as he spotted Lou Zigui walking their way. The Supreme Commander looked to be in a foul mood. Hearing the footsteps, Ning Xiaoyao turned and greeted Lou Zigui with a grin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander, why did you show up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui glanced at the shut palace doors before turning back to Ning Xiaoyao. “This subject requests Your Majesty to return to Supreme Splendor Hall.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, sure,” Ning Xiaoyao didn’t object. Since she’d already sent off the empress, why shouldn’t she go back to her own palace? Lou Zigui next glanced at Oil Jar on Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder, who quaked at the sight of the man. </span><i><span style>His eyes are like ice! I’m scared to death! </span></i><span style>Oil Jar jumped off Ning Xiaoyao’s shoulder and fled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong?” Ning Xiaoyao knitted her brows. She’d finally noticed that Supreme Commander Lou looked very unhappy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind them, the imperial guards stood with their heads bowed but their ears wide open, waiting to hear the reason. Lou Zigui simply brought Ning Xiaoyao along until they were far away from the guards, then asked, “Why did you send the empress out of the palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because the empress dowager wants her dead,” Ning Xiaoyao explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s going to Iron Buddha Temple?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes widened. “You even guessed that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rested a palm against his forehead. Zhou Junqi was at Iron Buddha Temple, so where else in the capital could the empress go? She didn’t have any other relatives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao continued. “I sent the empress to Iron Buddha Temple. It’s not like the late emperor can crawl out of the earth and bite me for defying his orders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s face was wooden. “The late emperor wouldn’t bite you.” </span><i><span style>How can dead people come back to life?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Exactly, yeah,” Ning Xiaoyao while wearing a very reasonable expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The empress dowager wants to deal with you,” Lou Zigui said. “So why would she divvy up her resources to target the empress? Just because the empress helped you prepare that spring banquet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not it? Then did the empress oppose the empress dowager in some way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How was His Majesty Ning suppose to expose the empress’s private affairs? After thinking it over for awhile, Ning Xiaoyao finally settled on an answer. “In any case, it’s all schemes and fights between women.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui stared at Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Saying that is like saying nothing at all. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Shadowgale arrived with a team of Dragon Guards in tow. Lou Zigui told Shadowgale, “The empress left for Iron Buddha Temple, send your men to guard her along the way. After you see Zhou Junqi, tell him that His Majesty has already discovered the truth of Prince Hong’s death from the past and is planning to straighten things out.” Lou Zigui paused here, before adding, “And also, His Majesty will find time to visit him at Iron Buddha Temple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale looked to Ning Xiaoyao first after hearing Supreme Commander Lou’s words. Ning Xiaoyao had no idea what the truth of Prince Hong’s death could be, but she still nodded at him and said, “Do as Supreme Commander says.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale accepted the orders and left the palace with his Dragon Guards. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not wrong for you to bestow favors on Zhou Junqi,” Lou Zigui patted Ning Xiaoyao’s head after the Dragon Guards left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao blinked. </span><i><span style>When did I bestow favors to the empress’s big brother? Why don’t I know about this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui continued, “Back then when Zhou Junqi acted on the emperor’s orders to quell the bandits, it was Xu Feiyu’s duty to protect Prince Hong and his family. But Prince Hong and his family all died by the bandits. Because Xu Feiyue earned the Grand Preceptor’s protection, all of the blame fell onto Zhou Junqi’s shoulders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s jaw dropped wide enough to fit in an entire apple. </span><i><span style>That can’t be right. Where’s the true love story? That surnamed Xu ruined the empress’s big brother like that, but he’s still the empress’s lover? Is it true that love makes all women blind?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “You didn’t know about this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head. </span><i><span style>How could I have known?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Now Supreme Commander Lou was puzzled. “Then why are you bestowing favors on Zhou Junqi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stared at him. “If I say I’m not, will Supreme Commander think I’m an idiot?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked back at Ning Xiaoyao. They stood next to each other, one looking down while the other looked up. Finally, Ning Xiaoyao dropped her head and took another apple out of her pouch to munch on while she walked. </span><i><span style>No need to ask. Judging from Supreme Commander’s attitude, he’ll definitely think I’m stupid.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You,” Lou Zigui began as he followed behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t talk,” Ning Xiaoyao handed Lou Zigui an apple as well. “I want some peace and quiet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui accepted the apple but didn’t eat it. “Why would I think you’re an idiot?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glanced at him before spitting out, “It’d be weird if you didn’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao polished off her apple without wasting a bite, even swallowing down the core. Lou Zigui saw her finishing it off with gusto and figured it was time to speak, only to see the girl take an even bigger apple out of her bag and crunch on it. Seeing that she wanted more time to think, Supreme Commander Lou had no choice but to continue to keep mum. As Ning Xiaoyao expressionlessly ate her apple, she looked quite concentrated. Actually, if Ning Xiaoyao’s head had a pot of water right now, it’d be boiling over. </span><i><span style>From what Supreme Commander just said, Xu Feiyu should be a mortal enemy of the Zhou Clan siblings. Then where did this ‘true love’ pop out from?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The quiet Big Boss Black on her shoulders finally spoke up. “The baby in the empress’s stomach definitely belongs to Xu Feiyu, there’s no mistake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That there,” Ning Xiaoyao turned to look at Lou Zigui. “I’m going to the bathroom. Supreme Commander, let’s meet in the Supreme Splendor Hall.” After that, she took Big Boss Black and sped off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Lou Zigui, who was left to stand in place. </span><i><span style>If she’s not going back to Supreme Splendor Hall for the restroom, then where’s she off to now? Isn’t she afraid of exposing her secret?! Ah, wait. </span></i><span style>Supreme Commander stopped fretting and made a 囧 face. </span><i><span style>Why do I even need to worry about her going to the bathroom?! </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: This...Supreme Commander, if you don’t even know yourself, who would? </span></i><span style>(╯▽╰))</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao brought Big Boss Black to the little flower garden in the palace so she could continue her meeting with her little pals. She took out the apples and divided them amongst Grandpa Sparrow and Yellow Great Immortal while repeating Supreme Commander’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar, who’d come back ahead of Ning Xiaoyao, asked, “Did the empress accept a traitor as her husband?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao really felt like Oil Jar was a cultured little mouse to speak so well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way, right?” Wifey Magpie couldn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Anyone of you know what happened that year when the empress’s big brother failed to suppress those bandits?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grandpa Sparrow shook his head. “It didn’t happen in the capital, so none of us saw.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Grandpa Sparrow, none of you looked into it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Grandpa Sparrow could answer, Big Boss Black said disdainfully, “Who’d bother asking about you humans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao had no words to say to that. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oil Jar can’t figure it out,” Oil Jar shook his head at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao asked, “Is Xu Feiyu truly the empress’s man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Truly,” Wifey Magpie said. “When the two of them got together, my cousin and his wife saw everything. My cousin’s wife said she really did see the empress bleed. That’s what you humans call the virginal something something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Does anything that happen at the Grand Preceptor’s estate escape those two magpies’ eyes?</span></i></p>
