 <p>Chapter 230: Supreme Commander is an evil vixen&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first thing Ning Xiaoyao saw upon opening her eyes in the morning was Lou Zigui sitting by her bed. She grinned at him and said, “Supreme Commander, you came to wake me up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui bent down to examine Ning Xiaoyao. Although the girl had just woken up without washing herself at all, she looked perfectly clean and neat. Her cheeks were a little red from being under the covers, as if she’d been dusted with a light covering of blush. He reached out his hand to pinch them as he asked, “Are you feeling all better now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” Ning Xiaoyao hugged her covers as she rolled from the head to the foot of the bed, before suddenly recalling something. “Eh? Where’s my Black Tubby? That jerk, he abandoned me and ran away after we slept together?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I didn’t know Black Tubby was a cat,</span></i><span style> Lou Zigui thought, </span><i><span style>I’d push this girl down and teach her a thorough lesson. What in the world is she saying?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Black Tubby?!” Ning Xiaoyao yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miaow!” Big Boss Black’s meows came from the flower gardens outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still in the mood to worry about your cat,” Lou Zigui said as he pulled Ning Xiaoyao before him. “Looks like your mood really has improved.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao gave a lazy stretch. Of course she was in a good mood. After waking up, she remembered that there were no zombies to fight and free breakfasts to eat in this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come and get up,” Lou Zigui pulled her up to a sitting position. “We’re sending off Tao Yu and the rest later.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Mwah,” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao planted a kiss on his cheek before jumping off the bed. “When are General Tao and the rest leaving? Can I eat some breakfast first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui personally picked up the comb to brushed Ning Xiaoyao’s hair into a bun. Besides his young nephew Lou Nan, she was the only person he’d wait on this way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander, the empress, she---” Ning Xiaoyao suddenly stopped when she saw Lou Zigui’s reflection in the mirror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm?” Lou Zigui waited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing,” Ning Xiaoyao dug out a sugar bean and tossed it in her mouth. </span><i><span style>Let’s take car of the battle stuff first. It’s not like the empress will come along trying to kill me today.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui finished doing up a perfect bun on top of Ning Xiaoyao’s head. “After sending off Tao Yu and Prince Fu, we can go stroll about the streets a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as she heard those words, Ning Xiaoyao’s spirits revived. She hastily nodded and said, “Sure, sure! We can eat out for lunch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” said Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>You haven’t even eaten breakfast yet but you’re already thinking about lunch.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>--</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>One hour later, Ning Xiaoyao brought the civil and military officials to the gates of the capital, along with the capital’s denizens, to send off Tao Yu and Prince Fu on their journey. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have to try your best,” Ning Xiaoyao told Tao Yu. “General Tao, you can definitely do it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tao Yu was serious and solemn. “This official will never betray Your Majesty’s expectations.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm!” Ning Xiaoyao patted him on the shoulder and turned towards Prince Fu. She thought it over before saying, “Uncle, ah, keep an eye on that bastard Xie Anji. And also, you have to survive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu didn’t want to talk to her. </span><i><span style>With Tao Yu, it’s ‘you can definitely do it,’ but with me it’s ‘you have to survive?’ Am I </span></i><b><i>that </i></b><i><span style>useless?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s with your attitude?” Ning Xiaoyao asked as Prince Fu rolled his eyes at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu replied, “Your Majesty doesn’t need to worry. This official will also use death to repay Your Majesty’s debts of gratitude.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao pouted. “You make it sound like I’m really sending you off to fight in the battlefields or something. Don’t fuss about. All you have to do is look after Xie Anji and figure out a way to come out of this alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the sake of saving Prince Fu’s face, everyone around Ning Xiaoyao simply pretended they hadn’t heard her words at all. Prince Fu himself glared at her but found himself unable to retort. It </span><i><span style>was </span></i><span style>true---he wasn’t fit for the battlefields.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And also,” Ning Xiaoyao added after some thought, “Don’t cause trouble for General Tao, ah. When it comes to war, General Tao knows more than you. If you don’t know anything, then keep your mouth shut.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu told himself to endure. Now wasn’t the time to get in a life or death struggle with Ning Xiaoyao. “It should be the auspicious hour by now,” he said crudely to Lou Zigui. “Can we leave yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked towards one of the astrologers from the astronomy department. “Is it the auspicious hour yet? If not, then I want to chat a bit more with my uncle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Fu immediately looked towards the astrologers. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....” went the astrologers. </span><i><span style>What’s the use of glaring at us when you can’t beat His Majesty in a verbal spar?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“General Tao, you have to take care, ah,” Ning Xiaoyao was now speaking to Tao Yu again. “I’ll take care of your wife and daughter in the meantime, but I’m telling you now, I can’t look after them for the rest of their lives. You have to take back your own life, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tao Yu’s eyes turned a little misty as he nodded in assent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The auspicious hour is here!” Prince Fu shouted. </span><i><span style><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="602d0f140805124120">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#!!*123(#!)$, I can’t listen to this anymore. The difference between us is too big, this prince just can’t take it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” the head astrologer wanted to tell Ning Xiaoyao that Prince Fu was wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then, set out!” Ning Xiaoyao waved a hand. Hearing this, the person in charge of setting off the cannons quickly lit the fuse and allow three successive booms to ring out loudly in the air. After that, the soldiers began to shout their war chant. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tao Yu once more fell to his knees and kowtowed three times to Ning Xiaoyao. Meanwhile, the head astrologer decided to keep his mouth shut. </span><i><span style>Auspicious hour or not, it doesn’t even matter in His Majesty’s eyes! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao bid farewell to the generals as they marched off into the distance. “When you guys come back victorious, I’ll be here waiting for your triumphant return!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scores of soldiers all chorused back with ‘ten thousand blessings’ to His Majesty. Someone, Xie Anji found this moments to sit up from the carriage in which he’d been confined. He knocked open the shuttered windows and stuck half his body out. One of Prince Fu’s guards saw this and quickly started to push him back inside. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Anji wanted to shout. </span><i><span style>“FATHE---”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fwoosh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A wine cup flew straight into Xie Anji’s face, knocking him back inside the carriage. All of Prince Fu’s guards turned as one towards the force. </span><i><span style>Which heroic figure threw a cup at the Grand Preceptor’s son right in his face?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao lowered her arm and said casually, “My hand slipped, hahaha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody spoke. Or rather, everyone had no idea what to say in reply to her comment. (o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grand Preceptor?” one of the Grand Preceptor’s faction asked for his opinion. </span><i><span style>If we’re going to save Xie Anji, we’ll have to stop the generals themselves.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie only shook his head slightly. His son would be fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was staring at Grand Preceptor the entire time so she could gauge his reaction. When she only saw him shake his head, she muttered to Lou Zigui, “The Grand Preceptor’s actually gone meek. What is this, a miracle?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui chuckled. “Isn’t it good that he’s learned to submit? Let’s go on back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her chin as she narrowed her eyes. “Why do I feel like something’s going to happen? That old man couldn’t be hiding something bad, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui pulled her away. “With Xie Anji in the army, Xie Wenyuan will at least hold back from harming Tao Yu and the rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao thought over Lou Zigui’s words and felt that they made sense. As long as Grand Preceptor Xie kept out of East Ji’s affairs, then she could fight him as much as he wanted in the capital. With this resolved, she stopped worrying as she asked with shining eyes, “Supreme Commander, where are you taking me out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where does Your Majesty want to go?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urk,” Ning Xiaoyao scratched her head. She still wasn’t very familiar with the capital city. “Windy,” she said as she sought out Shadowgale. “What other places in the capital have tasty things that I have yet to eat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale was currently shooting Lou Zigui an antagonistic look. </span><i><span style>We’ve just sent off the army to suppress the bandits and now he’s taking His Majesty to play in the streets? Is this the time for that? Does this man want to corrupt His Majesty?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking at Supreme Commander for?” Ning Xiaoyao asked after following Shadowgale’s gaze. “Supreme Commander is still really handsome today, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Commander, where do you say we should go?” Ning Xiaoyao defaulted to him again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale’s gaze on Lou Zigui turned even more unkind. “Evil vixen!” he cursed under his breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” Hearing their big bro curse, the other Dragon Guards could only remain speechless. </span><i><span style>So men can be ‘evil vixens’ too?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at Lou Zigui, who was walking shoulder to shoulder with her. </span><i><span style>Evil vixen? Mhm, </span></i><span style>she nodded, </span><i><span style>His looks are like an evil vixen’s for sure. If my willpower wasn’t strong enough, I might really fall to Supreme Commander Lou’s whims and turn out to be a fatuous, self-indulgent ruler. </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Where’s your so-called ‘willpower’ to begin with? </span></i><span style>&nbsp;(￢_￢))</span></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>One hour later, Elder Li stood in front of the palace staring at Shadowgale. “You mean to say, Lou Zigui took His Majesty to stroll around the city?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Shadowgale braced himself as he nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is now the time for that?” Elder Li asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder, it was Supreme Commander’s suggestion,” Shadowgale immediately pushed all the blame onto Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>In any case, His Majesty’s definitely a wise and brilliant ruler!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li looked at Shadowgale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty </span><i><span style>has </span></i><span style>been tired these days, too,” Shadowgale said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The army’s just left and their victory is still uncertain,” Elder Li said angrily, “But Lou Zigui’s simply treating this like no big deal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale didn’t say a word. He would never speak up for a man who was trying to corrupt His Majesty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Li stared at the palace gates before suddenly giving a curse. “Evil vixen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said the rest of the Dragon Guards. </span><i><span style>So men really </span></i><b><i>can </i></b><i><span style>be ‘evil vixens.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>--</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Ning Xiaoyao was standing in the lane, watching a street vendor make sugar figurines. She cradled two bags of snacks in her hands while her mouth was stuffed with goodies that made her cheeks puff up. Even so, Ning Xiaoyao tried to speak to Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have him make a lion, it’s got a solid center! That’s more worth it than getting the dragon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><a href="https://tasteoncemore.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/chinese-draw-candy-sugar-art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>sugar figurine seller</span></a><span style> had never seen someone so stingy about her snacks. He raised his head and said, “This is a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qilin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style>qilin,</span></i></a> <span style>not a lion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I want the </span><i><span style>qilin!</span></i><span style>” Ning Xiaoyao shouted, nearly spitting out her mouthful of snacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui nodded and lightly pushed the needle on the </span><a href="https://tasteoncemore.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/12429426_851999.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>wheel of goodies</span></a><span style> available for making into candy. Both Ning Xiaoyao and the Dragon Guards held their breath as they watched it spin around the circle. As it gradually slowed down, Ning Xiaoyao stared fixedly while it went past </span><i><span style>Rat, Peach, Basket of Flowers, Monkey, Face Mask, </span></i><span style>and past </span><i><span style>Qilin</span></i><span style> before going another circle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It has to be the </span><i><span style>qilin, </span></i><span style>ah!” Ning Xiaoyao exclaimed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Lou Zigui was getting a little nervous. It was almost as if he’d let Ning Xiaoyao down if he didn’t get her chosen animal. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The needle slowly approached the </span><i><span style>qilin </span></i><span style>again before stopping just short of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>(⊙_⊙ ;), went the Dragon Guards. </span><i><span style>It’s over. If it’s not a qilin, will His Majesty cry?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The peddler exhaled and said, “It’s the basket of flowers.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Achoo!” </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao took this chance to sneeze at the wheel, causing the needle to move forward two spaces until it stopped on the </span><i><span style>qilin.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the </span><i><span style>qilin!” </span></i><span style>she cheered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it moves after stopping again, it doesn’t count,” the peddler shot back immediately.</span></p>
