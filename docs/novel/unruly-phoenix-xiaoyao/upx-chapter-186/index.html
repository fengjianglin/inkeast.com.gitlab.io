 <p><span style>“Lord Protector came to the Grand Preceptor’s estate just to find His Majesty for this matter?” Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao behind him again. The Lord Protector glanced at the Grand Preceptor’s estate and also felt that the location wasn’t appropriate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Lord Protector, are you going to treat me to a meal?” </span><i><span style>After I’ve cured Pei Yan, will the Lord Protector’s estate invite me out to eat as thanks?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector only felt bewildered. </span><i><span style>Treat the emperor to a meal? Is this the time to be talking about that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No?” Ning Xiaoyao was a little disappointed. Although the Lord Protector was still confused, seeing the wrinkles on His Majesty’s face made him relent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He probingly asked, “Then shall I invite Your Majesty to this official’s estate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To eat your family’s food?” Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord Protector finally felt like he’d done something right for once and hastily nodded his head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t talk, I’ll take you to eat egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>later,” Lou Zigui dropped his head to murmur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It hasn’t been a month yet,” Ning Xiaoyao looked askance at Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>Are you taking me for an idiot?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s mouth twitched. “You don’t think there’s only one egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>seller in the entire capital, do you?” </span><i><span style>This girl’s such a fool, how did she managed to live so long?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>Why didn’t I think of that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What will you choose?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was stuck. After coming to this world, she’d yet to meet anyone who’d invite her out for a meal, but egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba </span></i><span style>were delicious as well. The Lord Protector had no idea what the duo were talking about, but he did hear </span><i><span style>‘egg yolk guoba.’ </span></i><span style>Thus, the Lord Protector said, “Your Majesty likes to eat egg yolk </span><i><span style>guoba? </span></i><span style>Then this official shall order the kitchens to make them for Your Majesty. Our chefs know how to make this dish.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lou Zigui saw that Ning Xiaoyao was nearly drooling at the news, he promptly lost his temper at the Lord Protector. “Stop talking!” </span><i><span style>If you don’t have anything better to do, why are you being so affectionate with His Majesty?! </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Supreme Commander, you’re jealous</span></i><span style>. (￢_￢)）</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Protector had a fright from Lou Zigui’s outburst, but soon grew irate as well. </span><i><span style>Lou Zigui, you’re Anyuan’s Supreme Commander and an official of the first rank, but I’m still the Lord Protector. What gives you the right to lecture me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Lord Protector prepared to give Lou Zigui a talking to, a young Dragon Guard ran out of the Grand Preceptor’s gates over to Ning Xiaoyao’s side “Your Majesty, something big’s happened!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor died?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guard furiously shook his head. “No, no! The Grand Preceptor’s men captured the head commander!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was convinced there was nothing wrong with her hearing, so she accepted the facts and quickly grew angry. “That’s wrong! I’m going to find the Grand Preceptor!” Tossing her sleeves aside, she prepared to stalk inside, but Lou Zigui kept a tight grip on her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” Lou Zigui asked the Dragon Guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guard only glanced at the Lord Protector, so Ning Xiaoyao said, “It’s fine, the Lord Protector’s one of our people. Speak, why did the Grand Preceptor’s men capture Windy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing His Majesty call him one of theirs, the Lord Protector quickly forgot his discontent towards Lou Zigui. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor’s ladyship said the head commander was spying on the fifth young Miss taking a bath,” the Dragon Guard said quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao had to doubt her ears this time. “What did you say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They said the head commander was spying on fifth young Miss taking a bath,” the Dragon Guard had no choice but to repeat himself.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who’s Fifth Young Miss Xie? </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh right, it’s Xie Duoying. </span></i><span style>After connecting the dots, Ning Xiaoyao recalled the long hair she’d once found on Windy’s shirt. </span><i><span style>First a hair, now spying on her bathing? What kind of predestiny is this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s expression remained unchanged. “Where is Windy now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guard replied, “The Grand Preceptor’s men wanted to catch him, but we brothers couldn’t stand by and just watch, so the rest of them are facing off against the Grand Preceptor’s men in the back courtyard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what are we waiting for?” Ning Xiaoyao simply ran into the Grand Preceptor’s estate. The Dragon Guard quickly followed suit, too busy to bother with Lou Zigui. When the Grand Preceptor’s men saw Ning Xiaoyao come back, they only felt their livers ache. </span><i><span style>Why isn’t he gone yet?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Protector, would you like to take a look as well?” Since Lou Zigui couldn’t stop Miss Ning, he was in no more rush. He even had the patience to exchange words with the Lord Protector.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Lord Protector replied without a second thought. </span><i><span style>I’m already one of His Majesty’s people, so how could I stay out?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Please,” Lou Zigui invited the Lord Protector to go in first. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Grand Preceptor’s men didn’t dare to block His Majesty, so they didn’t have the guts to block Supreme Commander or the Lord Protector either. The Lord Protector purposely chose to trod over the Grand Preceptor’s fallen front door. Though it was a childish move, it made him feel great!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was already at the entrance to the back courtyard. When the head instigator of the capture, Lady Wang, saw her show up, she flinched back on instinct. But she quickly regained her calm. She was the victim in this case, so she was perfectly justified in her actions. What was there to fear?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao didn’t spare the Grand Preceptor’s people another glance before asking after Shadowgale. “Windy, are you alright? Did the Grand Preceptor’s people hurt you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale shook his head from within the ring of Dragon Guards surrounding him. “Your Majesty, this servant is unharmed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm hmm~” Ning Xiaoyao said ruthlessly, “If they dared to touch you, I’d drown them all in wicker baskets!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Is that the only murder method you know? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Wang had never seen someone as vicious as Ning Xiaoyao in her lifetime. </span><i><span style>Completely insensible! That servant Shadowgale ruined the prospects of a Xie Clan daughter, but it’s still the Xie Clan who has to pay? </span></i><span style>Lady Wang looked coldly towards Xie Duoying’s mother, Xie Anyi’s concubine Madame Fu.[1. </span><i><span style>Madame Fu </span></i><span style>(傅姨娘) - </span><i><span style>Fu </span></i><span style>is a surname that is archaic for “teach, instruct, help,” </span><i><span style>Yiniang </span></i><span style>is a form of address for father’s concubine.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Fu fell to her knees beneath Lady Wang’s glare and burst into tears for the sake of her pure and chaste daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keep crying and I’ll get physical,” Ning Xiaoyao warned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scared, Madame Fu immediately shut up. Ning Xiaoyao turned her shining eyes on Shadowgale and asked, “Did you see anything good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale replied, “See what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Didn’t they say Xie Duoying was bathing without her clothes on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Shadowgale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......” said the rest of the Dragon Guards. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why is His Majesty always concerned with different details than the rest of us?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stared at Shadowgale with her sparkling eyes until the head commander stiffly shook his head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aye,” Ning Xiaoyao sighed, “So you didn’t see anything, ah. Then aren’t we fighting with the Grand Preceptor’s estate for nothing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale only felt black lines across his face. </span><i><span style>That’s really ‘too bad,’ is it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Guards felt that His Majesty’s words had merit. Their leader hadn’t even seen anything, so they’d be the ones losing out if they fought against the Grand Preceptor’s men. (</span><i><span style>Author: Wake up, all of you! You can’t settle debts with logic like that…</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Ning Xiaoyao rubbed her nose. “If you didn’t see anything, then why did Lady Wang say you did?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This servant, I---I heard a girl crying inside the rooms, so I stood outside to ask how she was doing. But then a bunch of servants and old </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>ran out of a side door. Only then did this servant find out it was Fifth Young Miss Xie inside the room,” Shadowgale stammered out, a clear sign of his agitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao glanced at the two-storey building behind the Dragon Guards and asked, “Is Fifth Young Miss still inside?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor’s estate must be trying to malign the head commander!” multiple Dragon Guards piped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “Yes, that’s right. This was a pre-planned trap to capture Windy. Speaking of which, Windy, why did you come here by yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I,” Shadowgale wanted to speak, but quickly shut up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hm? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt that something was up. “Come on,” she said as she patted her chest. “Tell me the truth. Just what’s going on? I can shoulder the burden of anything, no matter how fierce the storms and tempests might be!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s even brought up storms and tempests, </span></i><span style>the Dragon Guards thought as they looked at Ning Xiaoyao. </span><i><span style>What kind of nonsense is he blabbing about?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>While Ning Xiaoyao was rambling to the Dragon Guards, Lady Wang was in a towering rage. Ever since His Majesty came into the courtyard, he hadn’t spared a glance to her. Was he ignoring her existence?! (</span><i><span style>Author: If you already know the answer, why are you still asking the question, madame?</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Lady Wang called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao turned and said, “Oh, so you still know I’m Your Majesty. I thought you had no idea, your ladyship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Lady Wang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why aren’t you kneeling in the presence of the emperor!” a Dragon Guard shouted at the Grand Preceptor’s people. Immediately, everyone in the courtyard except for Lady Wang fell to their knees. It really was strange, but every time they saw His Majesty they’d forget they had to kneel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty,” Lady Wang looked at Ning Xiaoyao with teary eyes. “Do you really want to humiliate our Xie Clan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao replied, “Look at what you’re saying. When have I ever humiliated your Xie Clan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Wang burst into sobs. “Fifth daughter is a pure and chaste young maiden, but now she’s been ruined!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hold on, you,” Ning Xiaoyao turned sideways to point at the boudoir behind them. “Windy was both outside the door and the wall, so what could he have seen? Was your Xie Duoying bathing in the courtyard?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Wang choked, before she sobbed out, “All he did was walk into the building and out, who knows what he did during that time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well dang, from what I’m hearing, you won’t be satisfied until Windy sees Xie Duoying once today, is that it?” Ning Xiaoyao said. “You think that just by smearing Windy’s good name, you can recover Xie Duoying’s reputation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Wang said, “Does Your Majesty want to force this wife unto death with your words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just find you, you and the Grand Preceptor really are peas in a pod,” Ning Xiaoyao crossed her arms. “Grand Preceptor asked me if I wanted him to die; now you’re saying I’m forcing you to die as well. Why is it that every time it’s you two, the fault’s always on the other party? So we outsiders have no rhyme or reason, is that it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Wang shook her head before insisting, “Your Majesty must give this wife an explanation for today’s events.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And if I don’t?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “You going to bite me to death, ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Wang felt her body shudder. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, that there,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she pointed in the direction of the Grand Preceptor’s study. “Find your man and have him rally his troops for a revolt right now. I’ll wait, you go ahead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Wang suddenly lost all strength in her body. So what if she had justification on her side? The person standing before her was the emperor, and this was Yongning’s kingdom. Could she fight against the Heavens themselves? Lady Wang crumpled to the ground. Because she’d been crying too much over the past few days, all her tears had dried up. Now she only felt her eyes stinging with no relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at Lady Wang and shook her head. “You can stop pretending. If you really wanted the best for Xie Duoying, you wouldn’t do something like this. By using her against me, you’ll ruin that little girl regardless of whether you win or lose.”</span></p>
