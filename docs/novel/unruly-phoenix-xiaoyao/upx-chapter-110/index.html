 <p>Chapter&nbsp;110: If you're not a lunatic, then you're a snake demon<span class="hidden-text">&nbsp;Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stared at Ning Xiaoluo’s face. </span><i><span style>No need to use knives? Then that means those doctors were looking for a face like Ning Xiaoluo’s. What does Grand Preceptor Xie need a face like that for? </span></i><span style>When she recalled the 70% similarity between both of their faces, she realized the answer for herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao chuckled to herself. When she’d patted Ning Xiaoluo’s shoulder just then, she’d ascertained that he was male. </span><i><span style>Grand Preceptor Xie must be searching for a replacement to take my place.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“W-what’s up with my face?” Ning Xiaoluo’s hairs stood on end from Ning Xiaoyao’s stare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you still believe that the Grand Preceptor’s a good guy?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo shook his head. Even Xie Anshi had shown up at the scene. If he still insisted that this had nothing to do with Grand Preceptor Xie, then he’d really be an idiot. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad,” Ning Xiaoyao said. “You haven’t gotten stupid to the point that you think Xie Anshi’s doing this behind his father’s back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo gave a start at those words. “That sounds pretty logical too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Ning Xiaoyao wasn’t worried about exposing themselves to the enemy, she would have thoroughly beat him up. </span><i><span style>Why are you soooo stupid?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoyao, you might as well let him die,” King Flower piped up. “Even if he keeps living, his idiocy will kill him sooner or later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo watched King Flower as he hissed continuously and leaned against Ning Xiaoyao. “Does he want to bite me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sighed. A normal person like her couldn’t communicate with someone so mentally deficient. “Think back on what happened. What else did those people say to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing,” Ning Xiaoluo replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Think again!” Ning Xiaoyao shook her fist at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Urk,” Ning Xiaoluo spent a long time thinking it over. “They also said stuff like how something was perfect, and that it’d gone to the Grand Preceptor’s estate. I, I didn’t really hear them clearly.” He had been scared to death, so he was in no mind to listen to those bastards talk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch,” Ning Xiaoyao clicked her tongue. </span><i><span style>He’s from a general’s family, too? Compared to Supreme Commander, he’s nothing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I, I want to leave,” Ning Xiaoluo said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at Xie Anshi. </span><i><span style>Perfect, gone to the Grand Preceptor’s estate. </span></i><span style>These words, when combined together, held significant meaning. Had those heartless doctors actually succeeded in creating her doppelganger and sent him to the Grand Preceptor’s estate? </span><i><span style>Is that even possible? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao furrowed her eyebrows. She’d paid a visit to the Imperial Physician Courtyard once, but discovered that this world didn’t even have basic antibiotics. </span><i><span style>But plastic surgery? Are you kidding me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Because Ning Xiaoyao had wrinkled her brows in deep thought, she looked rather expressionless and distant. Third Young Master Ning suddenly felt afraid to say another word. Instinct told him that his life might be in danger if he spoke up now. Eventually, Ning Xiaoyao hid her thoughts. </span><i><span style>I’ll take it slowly. If the Xie Clan wants to fight, then we’ll fight. There’s nothing scary about that. </span></i><span style>She rubbed the glistening scales on King Flower’s rain-drenched form and said, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Flower nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said Third Young Master Ning. </span><i><span style>I wasn’t mistaken, he’s really talking to that snake!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao dragged Ning Xiaoluo with her and left the compound in the blink of an eye. There wasn’t a single soul around this late at night as she shivered from the cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are the people who came with you to the capital?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. Since this guy was the son of a duke, he wouldn’t have come alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo’s head drooped. “They definitely went to ask the Grand Preceptor for help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao spread her hands open. “Then it’s over, we’ve got no luck. Grand Preceptor Xie must have killed them to silence any witnesses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, I want to see for myself,” Ning Xiaoluo stammered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, then take care of yourself. Goodbye,” Ning Xiaoyao said as she prepared to leave. </span><i><span style>If he wants to seek death, then there’s no reason for me to stop him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” Ning Xiaoluo saw that Ning Xiaoyao was leaving and panicked. He chased after her and cried, “Can you come with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t have time,” Ning Xiaoyao replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m from the Duke of Yue’s estate, ah!” Ning Xiaoluo emphasized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “I wouldn’t have time even if you were part of the imperial clan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I,” Ning Xiaoluo grit his teeth. “If you come with me, I’ll give you the Duke of Yue’s present for Grand Preceptor Xie.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A profit! </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s steps stilled. Ning Xiaoluo shot her a hopeful look. “Will that do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not right,” Oil Jar whispered in Ning Xiaoyao’s ear. “Xiaoyao, he was even captured by other people. Wouldn’t they have snatched Grand Preceptor Xie’s present from him as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Oil Lamp chimed in, “Xiaoyao, he must be trying to trick you!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Motherf***ing-- </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao raised her fists. She’d almost been cheated by this doofus! Fortunately, Oil Jar and Oil Lamp were both sharp. (</span><i><span style>Author: Your IQ can’t even compare to two little mice. Your Majesty, aren’t you even a little ashamed? </span></i><span style>o(╯□╰)o)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s never see each other again,” Ning Xiaoyao told him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just then it was ‘goodbye,’ but now it’s ‘never see each other again?!’ </span></i><span style>Third Young Master Ning was shocked and reached out to grab her sleeve. In a loud voice, he demanded, “Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were captured and your men all killed,” Ning Xiaoyao looked at him coldly. “Where do you think your family’s present is now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I,” Ning Xiaoluo didn’t know what to say. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go, or else I’ll beat you up,” Ning Xiaoyao pointed at Ning Xiaoluo’s fingers, which were still clutching her sleeves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I, but I can’t go home,” Ning Xiaoluo had a death grip. He was very straightforward, with a straight face and a calm heart. “I don’t have any money.” He didn’t even have a single copper coin, so was he supposed to beg his way back to the Duke of Yue’s estate in Fengzhou?[1. </span><i><span style>Fengzhou </span></i><span style>(奉州) - Literally “State of Feng,” or “Feng State.” </span><i><span style>Feng </span></i><span style>means “esteem, revere.”]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao couldn’t believe him. “So now you even want to borrow money from me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo said, “You’re a denizen of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia#Jianghu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style>jianghu </span></i></a><span style>that steals chickens and dogs to live everyday. What kind of prospects could your future hold? If you come back to Fengzhou with me, my father and elder brothers will give you a good future.” </span><i><span style>This guy came into the basement with a big bundle on his back, but didn’t want Xie Anshi to know he was there. If he’s not a thief, what else could he be? </span></i><span style>Third Young Master Ning felt he was rather insightful when it came to judging others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s so dumb,” Oil Jar said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, really stupid,” Oil Lamp seconded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Flower’s tongue flickered silently. He never spoke to humans who were idiots. Ning Xiaoyao didn’t want to talk to him either, because it was an insult to her intelligence. Instead, she raised her fist and gave the third young master of the Duke of Yue’s estate a thorough thrashing in the empty, rainy streets of night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo rolled around on the ground while clutching his head. He decided to forget any lifesaving debts he owed to this guy. As long as he could make it to Fengzhou in one piece, he’d make sure his father, mother, and brothers took revenge for him, ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you have any guts, then tell me your name!” Ning Xiaoluo shouted at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Name? I’ll let you talk about names!” Ning Xiaoyao said, before she struck his face. </span><i><span style>I can’t believe this doofus looks like me! What if people say I look like that idiot in the future? I’ll never accept it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Ning Xiaoyao’s thrashing left Ning Xiaoluo in tears. He’d always been nurtured and protected by his family. Now as he rolled about in the rain, he wiped away his tears and cried, “</span><i><span style>Sobsobsob, </span></i><span style>don’t hit me.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is he still a man? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao couldn’t stand watching him whimper anymore, so she continued to punch him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to leave first,” King Flower had enough of watching the show. He slipped into a nearby water-logged depression and bid his farewells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you planning to go?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll meet again, Xiaoyao,” King Flower replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright. King Flower, you have to take care,” Ning Xiaoyao wasn’t the kind of person who forcibly kept her pals by her side. King Flower was strong enough to survive on his own, so she respected his choice. The giant snake twisted his body before disappearing into the gutter by the side of the road.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoluo witnessed the entire exchange. He was sure the person before him now wasn’t crazy, so he must be a snake demon instead! Because of that, he asked Ning Xiaoyao outright. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the heck?” Ning Xiaoyao stopped beating him up in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think you’re a lunatic,” Ning Xiaoluo said. “So are you a snake demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar and Oil Lamp covered their faces from their perch on the side of the street. Even mice like them were embarrassed by humans like him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Snake demon?! I’ll snake demon you!” Ning Xiaoyao continued to beat him up while Third Young Master Ning endured her blows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, Supreme Commander Lou had brought along Shadowgale and about 20 other men on horseback to follow the little gyrfalcon here. Third Young Master Ning’s face was now so swollen that even his own parents wouldn’t be able to recognize him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Save, save me!” Ning Xiaoluo shouted towards Supreme Commander Lou, who’d gotten off his horse. </span><i><span style>That man doesn’t look like a monster.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“He called me a demon!” Ning Xiaoyao tattled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme Commander Lou looked at the pig-headed youth by his feet. Without a second thought, he lifted his leg and kicked him aside. His Majesty Ning felt greatly assuaged by the sight. “Supreme Commander, ah, why did you guys…” Ning Xiaoyao wanted to ask why they came here, before a set of outer robes hit her in the face, then wrapped around her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you cold?” Lou Zigui asked. He had taken off his own robes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If His Majesty Ning had snuggled into Supreme Commander Lou’s embrace at this moment like a little bird seeking warmth and murmured in a soft tone, </span><i><span style>‘Not anymore,’ </span></i><span style>the scenery against the night spring rain would be completely warm and romantic. Unfortunately, Ning Xiaoyao was a wet blanket who spoiled the mood with her reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah? I’m not cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui lowered his voice. “Why did you leave the palace on your own? What’s that on your back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys,” Behind them, Ning Xiaoluo propped himself up as he shouted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clang clank clang. </span></i><span style>There was the sounds of swords unsheathing before the Dragon Guards rested their blades against Ning Xiaoluo’s neck. Third Young Master Ning immediately shut up, his lips pressed into a fine line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This jerk’s the third young master of the Duke of Yue’s estate,” Ning Xiaoyao told them unhappily. “He entered the city to give Grand Preceptor Xie a birthday gift, but the Grand Preceptor had him captured and nearly took his life. I saved him, but he came right back and cursed me as a demon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Shadowgale and the rest allow that kind of thing? Cursing His Majesty was already a death sentence, but this little brat had even repaid kindness with enmity?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beat him up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown which Dragon Guard raised the cry, but soon enough they were all punching and kicking Ning Xiaoluo. Lou Zigui rested his hand against his forehead. Was he the only one who heard Ning Xiaoyao say this was the third young master of the Duke of Yue’s estate?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright already,” Supreme Commander Lou spoke up when it seemed like Ning Xiaoluo was about to expire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme Commander Lou hadn’t been very loud, but all of the Dragon Guards stopped. Third Young Master Ning remained sprawled on the ground, crying. Just who had he offended? The capital city was too frightening. He wanted to go home!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui asked Ning Xiaoyao, “Is he really the third young master of the Duke of Yue’s estate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He said so himself,” Ning Xiaoyao replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“........” said Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>So you believed him?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao smoothed out her sleeves. “Dangit, so that jerk was lying to me about that too?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So, just how many times were you tricked? </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao back before she went to beat up Ning Xiaoluo again. “I’ll go ask him.” They couldn’t beat up the guy anymore, or else he’d die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t hit me,” Ning Xiaoluo sobbed as Lou Zigui drew near.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This one is named Lou Zigui,” Supreme Commander Lou said as he looked at the boy. “You said you were from the Duke of Yue’s estate. Do you have any proof?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lou Zigui?” Ning Xiaoluo rubbed his eyes. “You’re that Cuckoo Lou who doomed his entire family to death and curses anyone who meets you to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“..........” said Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said the Dragon Guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oil Jar heaved a sigh at his elder cousin Oil Lamp. “I’ve never seen a human who seeks death as much as he does, squeak~”</span></p>
