 <p><span style>Chapter 282: Supreme Commander wants to buy a skirt for Xiaoyao</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing outside the bedroom door, Ning Xiaoyao tugged Lou Zigui’s sleeve as she watched the floodwater in the room began to flow out onto the courtyard. "Supreme Commander, my fighting abilities are good, right?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui lowered his head and observed Ning Xiaoyao's hand. Those hands were small, very fair, with tender flesh. How could such hands have the strength to pop the groundwater out? It was incomprehensible to Supreme Commander Lou. In any case, he did not have such ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Supreme Commander?" Ning Xiaoyao’s eyes blinked her eyes at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, Lou Zigui wasn’t going to say no. </span><i><span style>If he says no, this girl might just create another mouth of a fountain! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Say something, ”urged Ning Xiaoyao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s talk about it later.” Lou Zigui only gave a curt answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s squishy cheeks sunk. "Supreme Commander, you’re not taking me seriously me again." </span><i><span style>The war is about to break out, who has time to discuss it with you later?</span></i><span style> Lou Zigui stroked her forehead and changed the subject. “If we don’t fill this hole, this building will not hold out."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Whaa?" asked Ning Xiaoyao. In an instant, Lou Zigui got her attention again.</span><span style>"The room will collapse if it’s flooded for some time." Shadowthunder remarked next to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt pain. Her room was not burned down by Grand Preceptor's men. Instead, it was drowned in water by her very own hands. </span><i><span style>Why’s there underground water beneath her bedroom? Ahhhhhhhh!!!! (Author: Well, who can you ask? o(╯□╰)o）</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Should I go find some people to fill the pit?" Shadowrain asked. Based on the damage, they probably need some extra help. The water was flowing out like a flood. </span><i><span style>Heaven knows how deep a pit His Majesty could form ah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao rolled up her sleeves. "Let me do it." </span><i><span style>Ordinary people wouldn’t be able to fix this. She should take care of it. In her case, she could fill the huge pit within a minute. </span></i><span style>She shook her head and looked around her surroundings. Ning Xiaoyao stared at the flower bed in the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let it be," Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Whaa?" &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Emperor Ning and the three commanders glared at Lou Zigui together. </span><i><span style>He wants them to let the bedroom collapse?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"When the enemy troops enter the palace compound, they will certainly besiege the imperial palace," Lou Zigui said. "The palace’s bedroom is the most important place for them to attack. Without it, they will divide their forces.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If that’s the case, we can destroy them separately," Ning Xiaoyao touched her chin. </span><i><span style>When the enemy is superior in number, only fools would give them the opportunity to concentrate their forces against them!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you want the room or leave the city?" Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao by the hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was silent. She wanted to keep the room but she also didn’t want to leave the capital.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Choose only one of the two," Lou Zigui looked at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt her meat ached, her heart ached, her liver ached. Basically, everywhere ached.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowthunder wanted to speak. </span><i><span style>What other options do they have? Can filling a pit delay His Majesty's departure from the capital? </span></i><span style>But the moment the second shadow commander was about to speak, he was stopped by the third and the fourth commanders. </span><i><span style>Clearly, His Majesty is refusing to leave, while Supreme Commander Lou is forcing the emperor to go! During the war, they should think of how His Majesty could safely leave the capital. </span></i><span style>Therefore, Shadowrain and Shadowbolt implored Ning Xiaoyao. “Your Majesty, you should leave the city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm not going." Ning Xiaoyao stated in one breath. She spoke as if someone was trying to slice a piece of flesh off her. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If the house was gone, they could build another. But if a life was gone, where would she find another?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigul lightly nodded his head. He even threw the room into the equation, but he was still unable to convince Miss Ning. The only solution would probably be to knock her out. But Lou Zigui was stressed. </span><i><span style>This woman is immune to hundreds of poisons and she’s a fighter. How could he knock her out? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"I have discussed with Supreme Commander," Ning Xiaoyao explained to his three Dragon Guard commanders. "When the battle breaks out, I will whittle down Grand Preceptor’s force in the palace while Supreme Commander leads the troops to annihilate Grand Preceptor outside of the city."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three commanders looked at each other and then glared at Lou Zigui. </span><i><span style>You want to leave His Majesty on his own in the palace to fight against Xie Wenyuan's military forces? What kind of subject are you? When something goes wrong, you let His Majesty risk his life?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although Shadowthunder and the other commanders did not say a word, Lou Zigui could understand what they wanted to convey from their stares. Lou Zigui made a gesture at them, indicating they may go ahead. He had already tried his best. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your Majesty," Shadowrain exclaimed, "Let's leave the city. It's fun to ride horses and kill enemies."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes," agreed Shadowthunder, "it's cool to kill people like that!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowbolt added, "Your Majesty, a handsome man that can pierce through the Heavens should ride horses to kill his enemies. There’s no way you can do that in the palace."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at the three men, shook her head and said, "You guys don't know how to fight in a battle."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three Dragon Guard commanders: ... </span><i><span style>We don't understand, but you do?</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It's all right, I'll protect you," Ning Xiaoyao patted her chest and assured Shadowthunder and the others, "With me here, we won’t die."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui looked at the three Dragon Guard commanders. The three men looked like they wanted to drop down dead. </span><i><span style>If His Majesty has to protect the Dragon Guards, what’s the point of their existence?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Alright," stated Ning Xiaoyao. She looked at her bedroom and felt pained psychologically. Then, she looked up at the sky again. "So we’ve pleasantly decided. Supreme Commander, you will leave the palace as soon as possible to prepare for the war. I will make preparations in the palace and send everyone off to the Empress Dowager’s palace."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at the water-soaked ground under his feet, Lou Zigui found that he could not do anything about Miss Ning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Go get ready," Ning Xiaoyao ordered Shadowthunder and the other commanders. “Gather all the people together and send them to the Empress Dowager's palace."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain said with a pained expression, "What should I tell the Empress Dowager?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Just say that Grand Preceptor is rebelling. He wants to kill me. Then he wants to kill her and make Ning Xin the emperor." Ning Xiaoyao casually said, "If the Empress Dowager does not want to leave her fate in the hands of Grand Preceptor, she should believe me once. Don't ask anything, just stay at the Empress Dowager's Palace."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain was worried. "Would the Empress Dowager believe this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Either she believes me or Grand Preceptor," Ning Xiaoyao said. "Let her choose. If she thinks Grand Preceptor is a good father, let her bring Ning Xin out of the palace, I definitely won’t stop her."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain was not convinced. He still wanted to ask more questions. Shadowthunder impatiently spoke, "Why are you dawdling? Just follow what His Majesty said."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!” Ning Xiaoyao beamed. “Listening to me is the right thing to do.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowrain ran to do his task.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lou Zigui saw that the other two commanders were still standing idly, "You’re His Majesty’s people, too. Why is Shadowrain the only one working?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowthunder and Shadowbolt fled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the courtyard, the Emperor and Supreme Commander were the only ones left. The water flowed out noisily from the large pit and continued to spread. Ning Xiaoyao trod on the water while thinking about her room. She felt the pain acutely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Xiaoyao," Lou Ziguo made one last attempt.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ning Xiaoyao stood on tiptoes and kissed Lou Zigui’s dry lips. "Supreme Commander, I promised you that if I’m losing, I’ll run away. I'll go find you, and then we'll escape together."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui... </span><i><span style>Who’s the person who said earlier that he’s the Yongning Emperor and that he’s going to be with dynasty in life or death?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"We can only think of ways to kill Grand Preceptor if we’re alive, right?" Ning Xiaoyao said, "So I won't die. If Grand Preceptor is not drawing his last breath, I definitely won’t draw my last breath."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui raised his hands to caress Ning Xiaoyao's face. The moonlight was silvery and cold. The light spread across the land like mercury. Ning Xiaoyao looked at Lou Zigui, "So you can’t die either, Supreme Commander."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao's eyes reflected the starry sky. Lou Zigui responded with a low voice, "Alright."&nbsp;</span><span style>Ning Xiaoyao grinned, "So we agreed."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Promise me this," Lou Zigui gazed into Ning Xiaoyao's eyes. "If you can’t beat them, go find me. I'll be outside the capital. As long as we return to Anyuan, we can start from scratch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mm," Ning Xiaoyao nodded earnestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Switch to another room to rest," Lou Zigui pulled Xiaoyao to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, "My luggage is still in the room. They are worth money ah!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui: ...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wait for me," Ning Xiaoyao ran back into the room. </span><i><span style>She had lost her room for no reason. But she was not going to lose the furniture and all her clothes too! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui followed. Now the water had reached his calves. Ning Xiaoyao stood in front of the bed, ready to rescue her bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui waded to the front of the bed, the skirt worn by Ning Xiaoyao was still on the bed. Lou Zigui reached out and picked up the skirt, "You still kept this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, "I can wear it in the future. Isn't it pretty?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Very," assented Lou Zigui, recalling her wearing the dress. Supreme Commander suddenly pulled Ning Xiaoyao onto the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao looked at Lou Zigui "This room will collapse."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It won’t collapse overnight," said Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So earlier, when you told me to choose between my room or leaving the capital, you were trying to fool me?” Ning Xiaoyao reacted to Supreme Commander Lou’s “evil” motive. </span><i><span style>This person had wanted her to run away, ah! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s lips curled in a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Speak properly," Ning Xiaoyao puffed her cheeks. "Don't smile. Now is not the time for you to use the honey trap. You still won’t give up? Are you still trying to get me to leave? Didn’t we agree?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’ve never stayed in a flooded room," laughed Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That’s not my intention," Ning Xiaoyao felt stifled. </span><i><span style>If she had known this &nbsp;would happen, she would have smashed the ground outside. No, that’s not correct either. Maybe she would’ve drown the whole courtyard instead. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui laid down on the bed and gazed at Ning Xiaoyao. "I like the way you look in a skirt."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao’s eyeballs were swirling. </span><i><span style>Supreme Commander Lou’s behaviour isn’t suitable right now. Momentarily ago, this man was worried about the war. Now, he's in the mood to chat about a floral skirt with her? The scenery is changing too fast! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"In the future, I will take you with me." promised Lou Zigui. "We’ll leave the palace, and I'll buy you lots and lots of skirts."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Can you buy me food first?" Ning Xiaoyao wondered. </span><i><span style>Food is more important than skirts!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"OK, we’ll buy food." In the room with no lighting, &nbsp;Lou Zigui’s teeth were blindingly white under the moonlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You said so," said Ning Xiaoyao. "Get up, Supreme Commander. I'll carry the bed out first. Windy once said this is the dragon bed. It's very valuable!" </span><i><span style>The bedroom may be a goner. But if she sold the dragon bed, maybe she could compensate for the loss.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui reached out and pulled Ning Xiaoyao into his arms.&nbsp;</span><span style>Supreme Commander’s heart was like a needle at the bottom of the ocean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the bed was swaying and shaking, Ning Xiaoyao frowned, deep in thought. </span><i><span style>Aren’t they about to go to war? Is it really okay to be out of line at a time like this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm not going to let anything happen to you," Lou Zigui mumbled in a husky voice, "Xiaoyao, I can't let anything happen to you again."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thunder rolled across the sky, and the moon was suddenly hidden. The sound of heavy rain echoed. The torrential rain came unexpectedly.</span></p>
