 <p>Chapter&nbsp;162: His Majesty says, the son will pay the father's debts&nbsp;<span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Send Xie Anwu to Jiangnan to take over the businesses in Qin Xuan’s hands,” Lou Zigui told Ning Xiaoyao once they returned to the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t he Grand Preceptor Xie’s son?” Ning Xiaoyao was surprised yet again by Lou Zigui’s plans. But after hearing Lou Zigui’s explanation and how she was supposed to decree his cut ties from the Xie Clan, her eye twitched as her mouth trembled. “Xie Anwu actually agreed to your terms?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is he an idiot or something?” Ning Xiaoyao asked, dumbfounded. “His father might be a good-for-nothing, but are you supposed to be a good-for-something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, that’s not right,” Ning Xiaoyao blurted out, before attempting to salvage the situation. “I’m not saying you’re bad in the same way, Supreme Commander.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then just what am I?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re just someone who’s always up to dirty tricks,” Ning Xiaoyao said with a satisfied nod. “That’s all.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t that the same as calling me a good-for-nothing as well? </span></i><span style>Lou Zigui stared at Ning Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, let’s stop discussing this topic for now,” Ning Xiaoyao made a halting gesture with her hands. Lou Zigui had no idea what she was signaling, but he didn’t bother with asking. He knew the answers would only make him even more weary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can Xie Anwu truly be trusted?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He can,” Lou Zigui replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give me a reason to believe you,” Ning Xiaoyao said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme Commander Lou replied smoothly, “He can’t live unless Xie Wenyuan dies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao felt her eye twitching again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why shouldn’t we use people like him against Xie Wenyuan?” Lou Zigui added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao sniffed. </span><i><span style>Feuds between fathers and sons, is it? It sounds heartbreaking just to hear about it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How about issuing the decree today,” Lou Zigui leaned towards Ning Xiaoyao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure,” Ning Xiaoyao agreed. “That’s what we’ll do, then. I’m only happy when Grand Preceptor Xie is unhappy, so I’ve decided to abandon my conscience this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui hastened to add, “This is all on me. It has nothing to do with you, Xiaoyao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Drop it already,” Ning Xiaoyao stood up to walk outside the room. “A bad deed like this wouldn’t be possible unless I approved of it, too. The two of us are ants on the same rope. You don’t have to say anything else on the matter, Supreme Commander.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s fingers brushed against the ice cold red lacquer table beneath his hands. </span><i><span style>The same rope? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Windy,” Ning Xiaoyao called from the door. “Make some preparations, Your Majesty is preparing to hold court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale quickly appeared in front of Ning Xiaoyao. “Your Majesty will finally attend the assembly today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao replied, “Windy, you saw how Elder Li looked just then. If I try to request leave again today, he’ll either bite me to death or kill himself off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale’s mouth twitched. “Elder Li calls that ‘demonstrating one’s sincerity by dying.’”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t it the same as offing yourself?” Ning Xiaoyao asked. “Forget it, it’s not worth mentioning. When I go to court later, I’ll have to abuse Grand Preceptor Xie again. Aye,” Ning Xiaoyao sighed. “It’s not like I really want to, either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said Shadowgale. </span><i><span style>Your Majesty, could you not smile when saying things like that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui strode over until he was at the door. “Now that Tao Chen’s dead, Your Majesty will need to pick a new Nine Gate Infantry Commander.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao nodded. “That’s right, a provincial commander like that sounds like an important post.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Of course it is important! </span></i><span style>Shadowgale almost wanted to shout at His Majesty. </span><i><span style>The defense of the capital city and its public order all fall under the Nine Gate Infantry Commander’s jurisdiction. Don’t you think that’s important?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Windy, are you interested in the job?” Ning Xiaoyao asked Shadowgale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale was thinking of leaping to his feet before, but now he was just stunned silent. </span><i><span style>Make me the Nine Gate Infantry Commander?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Taking his silence to be mute consent, Ning Xiaoyao waved a hand and said, “Then you can have the job.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What do you mean, ‘then I can have the job?!’ </span></i><span style>Shadowgale quickly shook his head. “Your Majesty, this servant is a Dragon Guard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “I know that you’re a Dragon Guard, ah. Also, can you stop saying ‘this servant’ all the time, Windy? How many times have I told you already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shadowgale replied, “Your Majesty, just how could this servant go be an official in the frontal courts?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon Guards are forbidden from taking posts in the frontal courts,” Lou Zigui explained to Ning Xiaoyao quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Frontal courts?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The official courts of the palace,” Lou Zigui elaborated, “This is to prevent favoritism by the emperor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao understood the concept of favoritism, so after spacing out for a while, she said angrily, “Is there any sense to this? That old geezer Xie was the previous emperor’s father-in-law. Isn’t </span><i><span style>that </span></i><span style>favoritism?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui replied, “Dragon Guards are all military men, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yongning was a country that favored scholars over soldiers. The facts of the matter even left Lou Zigui’s expression looking rather helpless. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Your mother,”</span></i><span style> Ning Xiaoyao cursed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You cannot say such dirty things,” Lou Zigui whapped Ning Xiaoyao upside the head. Shadowgale immediately shot him a glare. </span><i><span style>Is His Majesty’s head something you can thwack like that?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao said, “If Windy can’t be the Nine Gates Infantry Commander, then who do we pick? Second Thunder?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said Shadowgale. </span><i><span style>We’ve already said that Dragon Guards can’t do it. Your Majesty, were you listening to me or Supreme Commander at all?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui rested his forehead against his hand. “He can’t, either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, then should I take it on as a part-time job?” Ning Xiaoyao stammered next. In any case, she didn’t have much to do as the emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui said, “Why didn’t you suggest </span><i><span style>me </span></i><span style>taking it on part-time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe,” Ning Xiaoyao chuckled back. </span><i><span style>Who cares what the Nine Gates Infantry Commander does </span></i><span style>(</span><i><span style>Author: Hey!</span></i><span style>).</span><i><span style> If you take this post, you’ll have to stay to guard the capital. Supreme Commander, aren’t you planning to save your older brother and kill the Northern Hu as revenge? </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head. </span><i><span style>How could you accept such a job?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What does your </span><i><span style>‘hehe’ </span></i><span style>mean?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t tease me like that,” Ning Xiaoyao replied. “Would you give up your Black Frost Cavalrymen? That Wolf King Modou is still alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui fell silent. Miss Ning’s words made perfect sense, leaving him unable to retort. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then shall I ask Elder Li?” Ning Xiaoyao suggested a third option.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Has Your Majesty heard of the Lord Protector’s estate?” Lou Zigui asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao shook her head. “No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui sighed and said, “The old Lord Protector died at Xie Wenyuan’s hands, so Your Majesty can make the current Lord Protector Pei Yi[1. </span><i><span style>Pei Yi </span></i><span style>(裴毅) - </span><i><span style>Pei </span></i><span style>is a surname, </span><i><span style>Yi </span></i><span style>means “firm, resolute, staunch.”] the new Nine Gates Infantry Commander.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did Grand Preceptor Xie kill off the previous Lord Protector?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He was falsely accused of stealing the army’s pay and provisions. For the sake of proving his innocence, he rammed his head into a pillar at the Hall of Golden Chimes and killed himself,” Lou Zigui summarized the events in a way that the girl would understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Grand Preceptor’s already like </span><i><span style>that, </span></i><span style>yet he’s accusing others of embezzlement? Did this happen during the previous emperor’s reign again?” Ning Xiaoyao said in amazement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s understandable, then,” Ning Xiaoyao curled her lip in contempt. “The Grand Preceptor was the late emperor’s true love, after all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.........” said Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...................” said Head Commander Shadowgale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao simply walked away. After going to the Hall of Golden Chimes twice, she knew the way herself now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Prepare His Majesty for the court assembly,” Lou Zigui instructed Shadowgale, who left while digging a finger into his ears. Sometimes His Majesty’s words were rather painful to hear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“But,” Ning Xiaoyao halted in her steps to address Lou Zigui. She felt that things couldn’t be so simple. “The late emperor was my father. Since he caused the death of the previous Lord Protector, I’ll be lucky if his family doesn’t want me dead to boot. Would he agree to take the post?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was worried that the current Lord Protector would only spit a mouthful of blood in her face at the suggestion. Or perhaps, he’d plaster her face with poop instead? She rubbed her face and privately wondered how big it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That won’t happen,” Lou Zigui replied easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s just you,” Ning Xiaoyao retorted. The late emperor had caused the deaths of Supreme Commander’s father and brothers. Even if Lou Zigui didn’t want her dead, it wasn’t guaranteed that the Lord Protector’s estate would feel the same way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui furrowed his eyebrows. “What </span><i><span style>‘that’s just you?’”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clap! </span></i><span style>Ning Xiaoyao muffled her lips. She’d almost said too much. Lou Zigui stared at her eyes until she burst out, “I’m saying that’s what just would happen if </span><i><span style>you </span></i><span style>were the Lord Protector, Supreme Commander.” Ning Xiaoyao blabbed out before blinking innocently. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Among Old Madame Xie’s items is a set of phoenix coronet and embroidered tassel cape. The coronet is known as the Five Phoenix Radiance, a treasure of the Lord Protector’s estate,” Lou Zigui told Ning Xiaoyao. “It was bestowed to them by Yongning’s first ever empress. When the previous Lord Protector died, the current Lord Protector, Pei Yi, was thrown into the prisons. In order to save her son, the old madame of the family gave the coronet to Old Madame Xie as a gift.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And then Old Madame Xie had Pei Yi set free?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pei Yi was sent into exile, while his younger brother Pei Yan[2. </span><i><span style>Pei Yan </span></i><span style>(裴殷) - </span><i><span style>Yan </span></i><span style>means “blackish/dark red.”] was punished with castration…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The heck?” Ning Xiaoyao yelled. “They made him into an eunuch?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui muffled Ning Xiaoyao’s mouth again as he lowered his voice. “It’s fine as long as you know what happened, there’s no need to say it out loud.” </span><i><span style>Why does this girl spread everything she knows?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“T-then what happened after that?” Ning Xiaoyao couldn’t help but feel that seeking out the Lord Protector’s family was just asking for trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Finally, His Highness Crown Prince repealed the charges,” Lou Zigui said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aye, geez,” Ning Xiaoyao patted her chest. “I’m glad he wasn’t made an eunuch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui covered his mouth with a cough. “By the time the imperial edict reached the silkworm house,[3. </span><i><span style>silkworm house </span></i><span style>(蚕室) - common name for a castration chamber, so named because it was kept warm and draught-free like the rooms for raising silkworms to prevent the newly castrated subjects from incurring infection.] Pei Yan had already been castrated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao wore a tragic expression. Although she didn’t know what a ‘silkworm house’ was, she didn’t want to ask, either. The main point was that Pei Yan had been castrated after all. “I know now. The person who did it must have been one of old geezer Xie’s men!” Ning Xiaoyao was convinced. “That had to be what had happened!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It should’ve been,” Lou Zigui agreed. “Pei Yan was castrated earlier than expected.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll ask one thing, was he completely chopped off down there?” Ning Xiaoyao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” said Lou Zigui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I mean,” Ning Xiaoyao explained, “If it hasn’t been completely chopped off, I can---I could probably heal it for him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you really cure that?” Lou Zigui asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao was completely serious. “I’ll know after I give it a try. So, was it completely chopped off?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard His Highness Crown Prince say it was just injured,” Lou Zigui felt awkward the more he spoke of the issue. </span><i><span style>I actually have to speak to a </span></i><b><i>girl </i></b><i><span style>about these things?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The Lord Protector,” Ning Xiaoyao stood straighter as she walked. “Alright, I know what to do now. Return the coronet and check the Lord Protector’s little brother’s injury. This way, their family might hate me a little less.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could Pei Yi dare to hate you?” Lou Zigui pulled Ning Xiaoyao back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ning Xiaoyao replied, “He should. Who told me to have a father that treated Grand Preceptor Xie as his true love? That muddleheaded fool created no end of disasters. Isn’t the son supposed to pay the father’s debts? Although I’m no son, I’m still heading the family business. Thus, I have to be the one to settle the scores.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lou Zigui’s expression seemed to have stiffened at her words. </span><i><span style>How great would it be if she wasn’t a scion of the imperial family and the Xie Clan?</span></i></p>

 <p><span style>“No matter who Xie Wenyuan recommends, you mustn’t agree, Xiaoyao,” Lou Zigui said hastily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I won’t,” Ning Xiaoyao waved her fists. “If things don’t work out, I’ll fight him. He doesn’t scare me.”</span></p>
