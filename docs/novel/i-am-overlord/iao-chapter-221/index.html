He currently resided within an elder estate owned exclusively by Long Hui, and he became a follower whose membership wasn't officially recorded in the Cloud Margin Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, a follower was essentially a servant. In the Cloud Margin Pavilion, such people had almost no status. Fortunately, Xiang Shaoyun was a servant of a high-level elder, which separated him from ordinary servants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were only several dozen followers residing in Long Hui's estate; most were Transformation Realm cultivators and a few were Astral Realm cultivators. The reason all of them had willingly become Long Hui's followers was in hope of receiving the slightest bit of guidance in cultivation during Long Hui's free time. Just that would be enough for them to benefit greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, all these followers weren't exactly people with incredibly outstanding talent. They were either disqualified disciples of Cloud Margin Pavilion or people Long Hui had subdued outside the pavilion. Otherwise, they wouldn't have willingly stayed as followers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from the followers, Long Hui had two disciples as well. One was a newly advanced King. He wasn't too young, and his name was Qin Yu. The other disciple, Zhuo Yi, was about 20 years old and was a seventh-stage Transformation Realm cultivator. He was one of the most talented personal disciples in the pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Yu was the eldest disciple of Long Hui and had been promoted to a common elder after becoming a King. Thus, he could move into his own personal elder estate. However, he seemed to hold Long Hui in high esteem and still remained with him even after his promotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the estate of a high-level elder like Long Hui was very large. It could easily house hundreds of people. As for Zhuo Yi, he still wasn't qualified to move out. Therefore, he naturally still resided within the estate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun's appearance did not attract much attention in the residence. Most people were only astonished at his young age. Long Hui told them that Xiang Shaoyun was a distant relative who would be staying temporarily. Nominally, Xiang Shaoyun was a follower. However, he did not need to perform any tasks, and he was even given an exclusive residence within the estate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like that, Xiang Shaoyun started his peaceful life within the estate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Cloud Margin Pavilion was worthy of being the strongest organization in the Cloud Margin City. Their inner pavilion was completely enveloped by a massive formation that gathered spiritual energy from its surroundings, resulting in an extreme abundance of spiritual energy in the air. It was a very good place to cultivate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the residence, Xiang Shaoyun silently stabilized his foundations as he contemplated on his next step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Wen Jinrui and Wang Jiaohua had just arrived at a relatively small estate. Only the freakishly talented disciples of the Cloud Margin Pavilion could own these estates. As for this particular estate, it belonged to none other than a genius of Cloud Margin Pavilion, the person known as the Lightning Kid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lightning Kid was the Young Lightning King's little cousin from the same clan. He similarly cultivated the overbearing power of lightning, and with his Lightning Spear, he almost had no opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn't for the genius that had appeared from the Chen Clan, he would definitely be the brightest genius of his generation in Cloud Margin City. Wen Jinrui and Wang Jiaohua were here because they were both members of the Lightning Alliance, a faction formed by the Lightning Kid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In each generation of Cloud Margin Pavilion disciples, geniuses with absolute confidence in themselves would appear. During the rise of these people, they would not forget to suppress other geniuses and subdue them one by one so as to grow their prestige. Subduing others would be greatly beneficial for one's future. Whether it was for one's status or for one's future power struggle in the pavilion, these subdued geniuses would be a great help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the current young generation of Cloud Margin Pavilion, there were three main factions. The strongest faction was none other than the Lightning Alliance. More than half of the inner disciples were part of this alliance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Second to it was the Red House, which was a faction catering mostly to females. Li Yaxuan was in it, and of course, they still had males in their ranks. Chen Zilong, a genius strong enough to not fear the Lightning Alliance was one such male.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the third faction, it was a faction of those not willing to join the other two factions. It was known as the Free Society, symbolizing their pursuit of cultivation without restriction. It was the weakest of the three main factions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wen Jinrui and Wang Jiaohua waited for a good while, yet their alliance leader was nowhere to be seen. Rather, a young man came out and berated, "Both of you are an utter embarrassment to the Lightning Alliance!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sorry, Guardian Qiu. We have been incompetent," Wen Jinrui said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Jiaohua's arrogance was also nowhere to be seen. She apologized alongside Wen Jinrui, "It's our bad. But the other party is really too arrogant. He shows no respect whatsoever for our Lightning Alliance."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hmph. Do you think I am not aware of the real story? Your cousin was the one who started all that!" the guardian said with a cold snort. He paused slightly and continued, "This is supposed to be your private affair, but since Gong Qinyin of the Red House has interfered, it is now an affair between the two factions. I will help you out with this, but you need to pay me enough contribution points."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't worry, Guardian Qiu. We already have the contribution points ready," said Wen Jinrui. He then lowered his voice and continued, "Guardian Qiu, a new batch of king-grade weapons have been released by my clan. Some of them are of an element that is very suited for your use. In any case, we are not doing anything with those weapons. Do you want me to get one for you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The guardian raised his brow before a pleased smile formed on his face. "Um, that's very thoughtful of you. I will get some men to figure out the identity of that person before deciding what to do next."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Thank you for the trouble, guardian," Wen Jinrui thanked cheerily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although losing a king weapon caused his heart to ache, it was worth it since he was able to make Guardian Qiu move against Xiang Shaoyun. One ought to know that this Guardian Qiu was one of the four greatest guardians of the Lightning Alliance and was one of the strongest experts of their faction. He was a personal disciple of an elder, and his full name was Qiu Chonglei with a cultivation level of eighth-stage Transformation Realm.</span></p>
