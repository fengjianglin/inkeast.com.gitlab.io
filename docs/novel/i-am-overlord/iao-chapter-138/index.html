The nine regions were respectively the Eastern Pass, Western Desert, Southern Wasteland, Northern Border, Central Region, East Divine Island, West Demonic Cave, South Divine Devil, and North Illusionary Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each of the regions was extensively vast and made up of numerous prefectures, cities, and towns. Each region was inhabited by millions and millions of populations of different races. Different organizations also filled the various inhabited regions and were classified into nine tiers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tier-1 organizations were the weakest and lowest of all, and their existences were generally not acknowledged. Tier-2 and tier-3 organizations were better off, as these were mostly the organizations populating the smaller towns such as the various clans. Upon reaching tier-4, an organization would start being acknowledged.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the tier-5 and tier-6 organizations, they were naturally much more powerful. As these organizations were more powerful, it was natural that their influence spread across larger swathes of lands. As for tier-7 organizations, they were famed and well-known organizations that were the elites of the various regions. As for the tier-8 and tier-9 organizations, they were basically legends. Sitting on their thrones, they overlooked the Nine God Provinces and were extremely feared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Organizations such as the Martial Hall Palace and the Gateflag Academy were basically tier-1 organizations whose existences were not even acknowledged. As for the organizations in Cloud Margin City, these were tier-2 organizations. As for the Cloud Margin Pavilion which also acted as the main cultivation academy of a city, it was considered a peak tier-3 organization that had a chance at becoming a tier-4 organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Cloud Margin Pavilion had Emperor Realm cultivators in their ranks yet was still a mere tier-3 organization. One could only imagine how frightening the higher tiered organizations could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At a certain mountainous area within the Western Desert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Towering mountains littered the mountain range while numerous pavilions and buildings stood erect in the middle of the mountains. The peak of the mountains were filled with mist, and from far away, the entire mountain range looked like a painting of paradise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Numerous cultivators could be seen flying in the air, roars of land and flying beasts resounded without stop, the verdant and lush trees swayed gently in the air, and a certain fragrance filled the air. The mountain range was also filled with swirling purple radiance, which gave it an incredibly auspicious appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A massive gate that was about 100 meters tall stood at the mountain range's entrance. On the door, the words "Ziling Sect" could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a tier-7 organization, there was no doubting Ziling Sect's position as one of the most powerful organizations in the region. In fact, it even had a chance at becoming a tier-8 organization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, the number one expert of the sect, also founder of the sect, Xiang Yangzhan had gone missing after battling a super expert of the region, the Death Magistrate, Shangguan Wusheng. The battle happened at a forbidden zone, the Wumo Pass. Nobody knew the result of the battle, as both of them had vanished afterwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some claimed that both of them had died in the battle. Some claimed that they were both trapped in the Wumo Pass. Some also claimed that Shangguan Wusheng had killed Xiang Yangzhan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ziling Sect originally had a hope of becoming a tier-8 organization within 1,000 years, but the disappearance of Xiang Yangzhan had struck a heavy blow to the sect. Apart from that, an internal disorder had also erupted within the sect. Some traitors took the chance to try killing Xiang Yangzhan's sole son and took over the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of that, even more resources of the Ziling Sect were exhausted, causing this sect that originally stood a chance at becoming a tier-8 organization to barely be able to remain a tier-7 organization. Within the Ziling Sect was a mountain called Shaoyun Peak, and on the mountain was an incredibly luxurious estate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The building occupied half the space halfway up the mountain. Within the spacious estate, several refined pavilions could be seen. Each pavilion was constructed from wood over 1,000 years old. These pavilions were exquisitely designed; the dragons and phoenixes carved into the beams and pillars made the pavilions look incredibly exalted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The courtyard of the estate was filled with rock gardens, springs, booths, jade platforms, and so on. Every part of the estate looked like it was something out of a painting. When walking in the estate, each step one took made one feel that a new scenery would open up before one's eyes. Looking at the estate from different angles gave one different sensations as well, and the estate as a whole seemed to be designed to give one the epitome of pleasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was such an elegant estate that was completely devoid of people, looking bleak and desolate. Occasionally, the wind whistled through the estate, lifting the dead leaves off the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, a young man and a young woman had arrived at the long-abandoned Shaoyun Peak. The two emanated flawless grace, looking like immortals who had descended upon the mortal world. Hand in hand, the two stepped into the estate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man looked to be about 18 years old. His face was as fair as the purest white jade, his eyes akin to a luminous pair of moons. Body tall and straight, his bearing was so impressive one would never be able to forget him after only looking at him once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young woman's face was as pretty as a blooming flower, her eyes were as clear as the clearest pond, and her skin was as fair as snow while her bearing was graceful and subdued. Revealing a clear outline of her flawless figure, her gorgeous silk outfit fluttered in the wind as she took graceful steps with her perfect legs that seemed to exist for the sole purpose of tugging one's heartstrings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone who saw this couple would exclaim that the man and the woman were a flawlessly attractive pair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Shaoyun Peak, a place once bustling with noise and excitement is now a desolate and quiet place. It is really quite a pity," said the young man as he gazed at a stele with "Shaoyun Peak" written on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young woman also looked at the stele; sorrow covered her eyes for a split second before it vanished. From her alluring lips, her voice rang out, "He was once a self-proclaimed number one playboy scholar. Unfortunately, this is a world of martial cultivation. A weak scholar is but a trash regardless of his talent."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hehe, do you think he is truly a playboy though?" the young man asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This place was once filled with hundreds of enchantingly attractive maids, all to serve him alone. Living such a life, how is he not a playboy?" said the young woman, a complicated look in her eyes.</span></p>

At such a young age, he was already a King Realm cultivator. In fact, he was more than a regular King Realm cultivator; he was at least a mid-stage King Realm cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The instant the stele was crushed, the young woman felt her heart stop beating for a moment. A sense of sorrow surged out, nearly causing her to lose control over her emotions for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Let him drift away along with the wind...,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;the woman thought as a vicious glint replaced the sorrow in her eyes.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yes, there is no more Shaoyun Peak. But how about him? Have you eliminated the weed at its roots?" asked the young woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hmph. If his loyalists hadn't protected him with their lives, he would have been killed long ago. He has most likely escaped to our enemy's territory. I already have some men there looking for him. I believe they will be able to capture him soon," said the young man murderously. He paused before continuing, "Even if he is already dead, I won't rest until I see his corpse. I won't take any chances."</span></p>

She then added, "Let's go. I don't want to stay here any longer."</span></p>
