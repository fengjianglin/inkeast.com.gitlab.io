 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white tiger was a species of demonic beast at the very top of the demonic beast pyramid. Their demonic powers were extremely powerful, and the tiny bit of white tiger essence Xiang Shaoyun got was definitely not enough to help him learn the entirety of what the white tigers knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, he had already benefited from the white tiger soul he had gotten during the Golden River Valley incident. The white tiger essence had merely awakened something that had been dormant in Xiang Shaoyun, allowing him to obtain a tiny part of the white tiger inheritance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just that tiny part was enough to cause Xiang Shaoyun to be wild with joy. What he learned was a technique called Tiger's Roar. Although the technique wasn't as well-known as the Lion's Roar of the demonic lions, that did not mean that it was a weak skill. Rather, those who truly understood the technique would know how terrifying it actually was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a roar, the world would tremble in fear! No living beings under heaven would dare to not submit before the roar of a tiger. That was how terrifying the Tiger's Roar could be. In truth, Xiang Shaoyun had already learned the technique when he had obtained the white tiger soul. However, he hadn't been able to unleash much of its prowess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he had obtained a deeper comprehension of it, it would definitely be alarmingly powerful. Apart from the Tiger's Roar, he had also learned two other techniques—White Tiger Wings and White Tiger Manifestation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Wings would allow him to grow a pair of wings, which would not only let him fly but would also increase his movement speed. It was a technique that would be a great enhancement for any demonic tiger. But since Xiang Shaoyun was human, would he be able to utilize a demonic technique like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other technique, White Tiger Manifestation, was an offensive demonic technique. It was a technique that let its user utilize white tiger energy to grow their battle intent. It also let them manifest energy tigers to attack their opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Xiang Shaoyun saw these three techniques in his Nether Soul Domain, he had the urge to immediately learn and master all three. However, he was currently busy refining the white tiger bone and could not afford to split his concentration. Thus, he suppressed his urge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white tiger bone slowly melted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun then sent over the Overlord Skyslaying Saber. Roars of dragon and tiger started sounding from the saber, with the tiger roars being much louder as if the tiger had turned alive. The tiger then opened its mouth wide and swallowed the melted white tiger bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, the Overlord Skyslaying Saber thoroughly consumed the white tiger bone. Instantly, vicious gold energy swirled around the saber, slowly repairing the saber's chips and damages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white tiger bone was able to greatly recover the Overlord Skyslaying Saber's lost power. But to fully restore the saber, more top-tier materials would be required. After all, the white tiger bone could only serve as the main material. Supporting materials were still required.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the top-quality goldsteel stone was a comparatively valuable material, it still wasn't good enough for the task. But Xiang Shaoyun had no choice and had to make do with what he had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the white tiger bone fused with the Overlord Skyslaying Saber, the saber's blade became more glossy. Its edge turned even sharper, and with the vicious gold energy combining with the purple lightning energy, the saber's power of dragon and tiger became even more pronounced. Now, anyone would be able to see with a single look that it was no ordinary weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Overlord Skyslaying Saber had thus recovered about a third of its true power. Just this one third was already far beyond what normal king-grade weapons were capable of. One could say that it was now as powerful as an emperor-grade weapon. If one could further repair the saber, it would most likely turn into a divine saber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun summoned the Overlord Skyslaying Saber out of his body. Holding it in his hand and sensing the intimacy between him and the saber, he was pleased. "Finally, it has recovered somewhat. I reckon it is much more powerful now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wanted to test the saber immediately, but he knew that the current Overlord Skyslaying Saber could easily attract the attention of some experts in the Cloud Margin Pavilion. If that happened, things would get troublesome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Looks like before I am strong enough to keep the Overlord Skyslaying Saber for myself, I need to look for a different saber to use," Xiang Shaoyun muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He understood clearly that having wealth without the strength to guard it was in itself a sin. In any case, a sort of connection had already formed between him and the Overlord Skyslaying Saber. It wouldn't be a bad idea to keep nurturing it in his astral cosmos sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he would be temporarily without a weapon, he had to look for a new weapon. Fortunately, Long Hui was a King who would naturally have a lot of treasures in his possession. It wouldn't be too hard to get a weapon or two from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun was in no rush to go look for Long Hui. Rather, his gaze now landed on the Heavenly Eye Stone. The Heavenly Eye Stone was something he had accidentally obtained at the Redwolf Bandits stronghold. A unique power capable of awakening the Heavenly Eye was most certainly hidden within the stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun wanted to split it apart to see if it actually had what he wanted. But after some hesitation, he decided to not destroy the Heavenly Eye Stone for now. After all, he already had the Nether Soul Domain, which allowed him to sense things others wouldn't be able to sense in his surroundings. Moreover, the Nether Soul Domain covered 360 degrees around him and wasn't any weaker than the Heavenly Eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of that, Xiang Shaoyun decided to keep the Heavenly Eye Stone for now. In the future, he could give it to that naughty sister of his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I wonder how that annoying little devil is doing now. She is probably much stronger than me already," muttered Xiang Shaoyun with a look of recollection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His younger sister was the person closest to him apart from his father. But she was much luckier than him, as a supreme expert had accepted her as a personal disciple. Thus, she wasn't staying with her family and would only return and visit occasionally. Although they rarely met, they had a very good relationship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun shook his head and tossed these distracting thoughts away and got back to business. He was currently staying in Long Hui's cultivation room. There was a formation here separating him from the outside world. Therefore, he did not need to worry that people would notice what he was doing.</span></p>

He first replayed the image in his Nether Soul Domain repeatedly. After activating his white tiger energy, he held his breath and abruptly roared.</span></p>

Any expert would be caught by surprise and suffer from the attack, including King Realm experts.</span></p>

Since it was an inheritable technique that had directly appeared in his head and he already had the power of the white tiger soul in his body, it wasn't hard for him to master it.</span></p>

He was a human, not a tiger. Thus, he would have to rely on his high comprehension skills to learn them.</span></p>

The White Tiger Manifestation can only be cultivated after reaching the Skysoar Realm," judged Xiang Shaoyun after thinking about it for a bit.</span></p>

If he could learn the technique, he would be able to fly before even reaching the Skysoar Realm. The mere thought of that filled him with excitement.</span></p>
