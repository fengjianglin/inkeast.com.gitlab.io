 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Huh? It's actually this big now?" Xiang Shaoyun muttered gleefully. He found that the astral cosmos sea was now the size of a head, much larger than its original size. At the very least, it was sufficient to store many medicinal herbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Looks like training the Astral Cosmos Sea Technique is the correct choice. It helps with the medicinal power absorption rate," Xiang Shaoyun said before standing up and ending his short meditation. He then lifted his Lightning Spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh! Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lightning Spear danced in the air like lightning bolts. With purple qi twirling around the spear, it split the air with an incredible might. Yesterday in the fifth limit room, Xiang Shaoyun had used the Lightning Spear Technique. His mastery over this spear technique had increased, reaching slightly more than 60 percent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zi Changhe required him to reach 70 percent mastery, and he was about 5 percent from reaching it. However, he was only taking this long because he hadn't been spending all his time on the spear technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of the various weapons, what Xiang Shaoyun loved most was still the saber. The saber was the overlord among weapons, known as the weapon for the fearless. That was also why Xiang Shaoyun had a soft spot for sabers since young. However, brandishing other weapons such as sword, spear, halberd, and so on still looked rather cool, so Xiang Shaoyun did not mind learning all weapons either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After practicing the spear technique once, Zi Changhe walked out from a certain corner and praised, "So you've already reached 50 percent mastery. That was unexpectedly fast. Looks like reaching 70 percent mastery won't be that hard for you after all. I don't have anything to teach you anymore."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zi Changhe had been greatly shaken after he figured out how freakish Xiang Shaoyun was. He firmly believed that even without his guidance, Xiang Shaoyun would still grow into an outstanding expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That is all thanks to your guidance, senior brother," Xiang Shaoyun said humbly. Although Zi Changhe had not helped him much, he was still the person who had brought Xiang Shaoyun into the Martial Hall Palace. As such, Xiang Shaoyun was very grateful for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zi Changhe smiled. "It’s good that you know to be grateful." He paused slightly and continued, "Moving on, you will be able to get anything you want so long as the Martial Hall Palace can provide it. In the coming half year, I hope you can focus on increasing your strength. A grand event will be held in half a year, and I hope you can win glory for Martial Hall Palace during the event."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right as Xiang Shaoyun was about to reply, someone else appeared outside the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Lu Xiaoqing?" Xiang Shaoyun cried out joyfully when he saw the newcomer. Then, he ignored his senior brother and jogged outside. Zi Changhe cursed inwardly when he saw that,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What a typical guy, valuing chicks over bros!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He left tactfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been quite some time since Xiang Shaoyun had last seen Lu Xiaoqing. She looked slimmer than before, and the previous tenderness on her face had lessened to be replaced by a tenacious look. This change made her look even more attractive than before. She was dressed in a green, body-hugging outfit, one that showed off her hourglass figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Shaoyun!" Lu Xiaoqing called out to the approaching Xiang Shaoyun; her eyes rippled with tenderness. For some reason, she addressed Xiang Shaoyun differently now, and this new form of address was much more affectionate than previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other day, she had left running after Xiang Shaoyun had berated her. But after leaving and thinking back about it, she finally understood that Xiang Shaoyun was only doing that for her sake. In truth, Xiang Shaoyun was simply trying to put her out of harm’s way. That was why he had scolded her away. But she only realized that after quite a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon realizing that, she rushed back to the Martial Hall Palace at the fastest speed she could and told her master, the eleventh elder, He Yinghua, about it. But when she returned to the ambush location with her master, Xiang Shaoyun was nowhere to be found.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Subsequently, after Zi Changhe returned, her master and Zi Changhe went to the Wu Clan for Xiang Shaoyun. However, they returned empty handed. She thought that Xiang Shaoyun was dead for sure, and she had been grieving over him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Recently, she had been in secluded cultivation. Only today when she had ended the seclusion did she find out that Xiang Shaoyun had returned safely. It caused her to be wild with joy. Unbeknown to her, he had already occupied a spot in her heart. Now, she finally saw him again. The confidence and grace he exuded had only grown after all this time. Gazing at him, she fell into a slight reverie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But she still needed to maintain the virtue of a young lady; thus, she resisted her urge to pounce into his arms. Xiang Shaoyun was unaware of all that. He only wanted to thank her properly. She was someone who had not abandoned him even during the most dangerous moment, a proof that she was someone worth trusting, a friend he could trust his back with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Tsk tsk, it has been only a month, and you have grown even prettier," Xiang Shaoyun couldn't help but praise Lu Xiaoqing when he got near her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Xiaoqing blushed as she replied meekly, "You're lying."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Haha, I don't have many merits, but one of the few I have is my honesty. But still, it's too bad," Xiang Shaoyun laughed as he looked at the blushing Lu Xiaoqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're still as narcissistic as ever!" Lu Xiaoqing said with contempt before asking curiously, "Too bad about what?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun coughed, "Cough, cough. Uhm, I don't think I should say it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"No, I want to know!" Lu Xiaoqing purred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Fine, remember, you demanded it. Don't you be angry over it later," Xiang Shaoyun stated before shifting his gaze to Lu Xiaoqing's chest and said, "Cough, cough, they're a tad bit too small."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Raising her brows, Lu Xiaoqing yelled, "Scoundrel!" Then she sent a slap at Xiang Shaoyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Xiaoqing was a first-stage Astral Realm cultivator. Although she did not use her full power, her slap still carried a considerable might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hey, hey, you promised you wouldn’t be angry! Why are you beating me? Stop being so coarse lest you won’t find a husband in the future!" Xiang Shaoyun yelled as he dodged the slap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're the one who won't be able to find a wife! You scoundrel!" Lu Xiaoqing stamped her foot on the ground and cursed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Haha, I don't mind getting married to a queen who can take care of my living for me! That would be great!" Xiang Shaoyun howled with laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You? Nobody would want you!" Lu Xiaoqing said. Despite what she said, this naughty disposition of Xiang Shaoyun had in fact deeply attracted her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, I'll stop messing around. Thank you!" Xiang Shaoyun stopped joking around and thanked her solemnly. He deeply hated those who betrayed him, but he also greatly appreciated those who were loyal to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Don't worry about it. It's not like I was much help anyway. I nearly got in your way instead," Lu Xiaoqing muttered guiltily. During the incident, she had felt completely helpless. And because of that, she had spent the past month cultivating with all her effort. Finally, she broke through and reached the first stage of the Astral Realm, officially becoming the personal disciple of the eleventh elder.</span></p>
