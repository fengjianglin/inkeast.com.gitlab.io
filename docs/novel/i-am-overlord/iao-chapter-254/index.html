Brand new Skysoar Realm cultivators wouldn't even dare to approach it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the second-stage Skysoar Realm cultivators that actually dared to enter, most of them would fail. A majority of those who had actually succeeded in challenging the room were third-stage Skysoar Realm cultivators. Even so, the number of those who had failed overshadowed those who had succeeded. From these results, it was obvious how hard challenging this room was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, Xiang Shaoyun was suffering in this second limit room. In the first limit room, he only needed to face some King Realm puppets, which wasn't difficult for him. Although the puppets had the combat prowess of second-stage and third-stage Kings, he was far faster than them. Furthermore, the puppets couldn't actually utilize energy attacks. Thus, it was only a matter of time before they were all defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ease with which he cleared the first room gave him an impression that the second room wouldn't be much of a challenge either. Only after entering the second room did he realize how wrong he was. There were no opponents to be defeated in this room. One only needed to survive one hour for the challenge to be considered a success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a room filled with attacks formed through formations. The numerous attacks were currently bombarding Xiang Shaoyun relentlessly. Although he had a powerful energy barrier protecting him, before such bombardment, his barrier was directly smashed apart like it was nothing. The attacks landed on his body, putting him in so much pain he wailed miserably. These attacks were comparable to the attacks of a fourth-stage Skysoar Realm cultivator, and he was completely helpless against them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Ahhhh!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter where Xiang Shaoyun ran, the attacks were able to accurately locate him and pound him mercilessly. Numerous deep wounds could be seen on his body, and even his bones were visible from these terrible wounds. If he hadn't gone through the baptism of lightning, he would have been dead by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I can't go on like this or I will die,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;thought the anxious Xiang Shaoyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He pushed himself to his limits, fully unleashing all his power, the innate purple lightning included. He formed a purple and gold defensive barrier, and even his wings unfurled and started slapping the attacks around him repeatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Tiger Wings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ability was a pair of wings granting Xiang Shaoyun the ability to fly. But it also possessed other functions, such as for attacking and defending. He was taking this opportunity to further enhance the offensive and defensive capabilities of his wings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His wings were filled to the brim with vicious gold energy. On top of that, he even activated the white tiger essence in his second star, causing an apparition of a roaring white tiger to appear behind him. The pair of wings seemed to have turned completely alive, flapping over and over again. The trajectories of all the incoming attacks surfaced in his Nether Soul Domain, and the wings sliced through these attacks like the sharpest of blades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble! Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At first, Xiang Shaoyun was still having a hard time fully stopping the attacks, and new wounds continued appearing on his body. But after a while, the White Tiger Wings finally showed its true prowess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Powered by the white tiger essence, the wings came alive. They turned incomparably tough, comparable to even king-grade weapons. It was then that the wings started successfully intercepting the incoming attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That placed Xiang Shaoyun in a much better position, but he did not dare to be complacent. He concentrated all his strength into his wings as they flapped, sliced, and swept...each movement was done completely in accordance to his will. It was as if these wings had become a part of him, his control over them soaring rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, an hour passed. Xiang Shaoyun quickly fled the room. Although he could now defend himself against the onslaught, the injuries he had sustained early on had been too severe. Furthermore, the energy exhaustion of using the White Tiger Wings was too large. He would not be able to last much longer. When he left the room, he noticed numerous pairs of eyes focusing on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"H-he actually succeeded in the second room challenge as well? H-how did this kid do that?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Does that not mean that his combat prowess is comparable to a third-stage or even fourth-stage Skysoar Realm cultivator's? That is way too scary!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What a freak. The Lightning Kid has found himself an opponent for sure."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yeah. And he's still just an eighth-stage Transformation Realm cultivator, right? Holy shit, what a madman!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were the Kings who had been waiting ever since they had found out Xiang Shaoyun had succeeded in his first limit room challenge, and they were trying to see if he could succeed in challenging the second room as well. After waiting for an hour, they saw him come out with injuries all over his body, confirming that he had succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder in charge immediately appeared before Xiang Shaoyun and handed him a healing pill before saying, "You are a very outstanding young man. Take some time to heal up. I will prepare your contribution points for you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun did not hold back and accepted the pill before tossing it straight into his mouth. He then sat down nearby and started refining the pill. Although it was a pill with remarkable medicinal power, it was impossible for him to fully heal up with just this one pill.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, he had a large amount of medicinal power still hidden within his body. After sustaining these injuries, more of the medicinal power was pushed out from his flesh. Strands of medicinal power coursed through his body, healing his injuries and improving his recovery speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the past two years, as Xiang Shaoyun grew in strength, it was becoming harder for him to excavate more medicinal power from his body. It was not that the power was spent, but it was simply that the remaining power was hidden much deeper inside his body. Only by even harsher tempering would he be able to excavate the deeply hidden medicinal power.</span></p>

Of course, most of the medicinal power was used to heal himself. Thus, he did not actually grow much in strength this time.</span></p>

All his mind was filled with the excitement from what his white tiger wings had done in the limit room. Through this test, he had finally gotten a clear recognition at how powerful the wings were. Not only were they capable of allowing him to fly, they could also be used as weapons, which would definitely catch his opponents by surprise.</span></p>

His wounds had healed considerably as well. He stood up and headed toward the second room once again.&nbsp;</span></p>

Don't keep pushing yourself. In any case, you have already succeeded in the challenge."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder was advising him out of good intentions. After all, if Xiang Shaoyun forced himself too much, it would only exacerbate his injuries. If he ended up receiving some long-lasting injuries, what he stood to gain from pushing on would not be worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun cupped his hands at the elder and said, "Don't worry, lord. I should be fine."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Xiang Shaoyun was insisting, the elder did not stop him and allowed him to enter the room.</span></p>

He did not suffer as many injuries as before, but he had still exhausted himself greatly. He was almost completely emptied of energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But after a short rest, Xiang Shaoyun entered the room again. Again, he left after an hour. The elder was completely stunned watching everything unfold. The Kings were still there, and by now they were completely speechless.</span></p>

But that kid had gone in and out three times in a row, as if that limit room was his personal cultivation room!</span></p>
