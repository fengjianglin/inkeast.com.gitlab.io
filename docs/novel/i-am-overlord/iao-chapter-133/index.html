The body of the Overlord Skyslaying Saber was still damaged, and the white tiger skeleton could be used to repair it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why Xiang Shaoyun was staring at the white tiger skeleton with excitement. He rubbed his hands as he walked toward the white tiger. When he placed his hand on the skeleton, he could feel that apart from being incomparably tough, the skeleton was also very smooth to the touch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The white tiger is indeed worthy of being a top-tier demonic beast. After dying for so many years, the skeleton is still in perfect condition. Each piece of bone on this frame of skeleton can be auctioned off at a high price," Xiang Shaoyun lamented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that this white tiger skeleton was related to Little White. He himself had also benefited from the white tiger soul. He was not supposed to set his sights on this skeleton after all he had benefited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Xiang Shaoyun was left with few options. He had to keep growing. At the same time, his weapon had to keep growing as well. Even though the Overlord Skyslaying Saber was an extraordinary weapon, before its full restoration, it would have limited power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Well, since Little White is still busy digesting that clump of power, I will just take a piece of bone off the skeleton. That would be enough for now," Xiang Shaoyun mumbled to himself as he circled the skeleton, trying to look for a suitable piece of bone. Ultimately, his gaze landed on the backbone, which was several dozen meters long. It was a perfect backbone, running along the skeleton like a graceful dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Xiang Shaoyun was also clear that if he took this backbone, the entire frame of the skeleton would collapse. He sank into deep thought. Should he take it? If he took it off, he would be able to repair the Overlord Skyslaying Saber but that might hurt Little White. At the same time, he found it hard to just ignore such a fine backbone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Forget it. This backbone might be very important to Little White. I'll decide after Little White wakes up." Xiang Shaoyun ultimately decided to respect Little White and put the matter aside for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No longer distracted by the skeleton, he finally had the chance to study his surroundings. A thick layer of vicious gold aura formed the ceiling of this place, acting as a natural barrier preventing anyone else from entering. As for this space itself, apart from the skeleton, it was nearly empty. He could see everything here with a single glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far from the skeleton was a puddle of gold liquid. The puddle emanated pure vicious gold aura, and a stalk of gold herb was growing on the puddle. It looked like a gold lotus, and in the middle of the petals, a clump of white tiger energy hovered. Occasionally, the projection of a white tiger would jump out of the lotus, looking extremely vigorous and lifelike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun darted forward and stared at the puddle and the herb. He gulped and said, "Is this white tiger blood? And is this the gold lunar liquid? And this a stalk of vicious tiger gold lotus! Am I seeing things?"</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White tiger blood was naturally a precious treasure. Each drop of it was invaluable. That was also the case for the gold lunar liquid. It was a liquid with pure gold energy, and like the lightning liquid, it was an extremely rare divine liquid. Other spirit liquids could hardly be compared to the likes of gold lunar liquid and lightning liquid. As for the vicious tiger gold lotus, it was something that only existed in legends. It was a plant that would only grow where a white tiger resided. It was an incredibly rare herb with much stronger medical efficacy than regular spirit medicines or even king medicines. Simply put, it was priceless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Any one of these treasures was valuable enough to cause a large number of experts to kill each other to get their hands on the treasure. With them all lying quietly here, Xiang Shaoyun's heart started thumping. Fortunately, he was able to maintain reason as he muttered, "Everything here belongs to Little White. I'll wait until he wakes up."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For Xiang Shaoyun, Little White was like a brother. He would never take the belongings of a brother without permission. He was confident that Little White would definitely be willing to share so long as he asked for it anyway. Thus, he continued looking around. His gaze landed on the pile of golden rocks nearby.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Top-quality goldsteel stone!" Xiang Shaoyun cried out gleefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The goldsteel stone was king among materials, and top-quality goldsteel stone was emperor among materials. Without thinking twice, Xiang Shaoyun darted over. He wanted to put the goldsteel stones away, but found that they were framed around the golden puddle. He could not wantonly dig them out as that would result in the destruction of the puddle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun felt like he was at a buffet where he could only see but not touch anything. Because of that, he grew agitated, but was left with no choice but to step away helplessly. There were other treasures in the room as well, but these treasures were naturally not as valuable as the ones he had found initially.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, there were a lot of ordinary goldsteel stones, which were all king materials and could be sold for many spirit crystals. Other than that, there were stones containing vicious gold energy, known as vicious gold stones. These stones could be used to help a cultivator nurture vicious gold energy within their body and increase the cultivator's combat power. Thus, these vicious gold stones were no less valuable than the goldsteel stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun tried absorbing some vicious gold energy from one of the vicious gold stones and found that he could do it easily. Only then did he notice that his second star was already completely filled with pure vicious gold energy, also known as the white tiger's ire. Because of that, he now had a certain level of resonance with natural vicious gold energy and was able to easily refine the energy without being harmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These random treasures occupied around 20 square meters of the space within Xiang Shaoyun’s astral cosmos sea. After leaving this place, he would be able to trade the treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since I am already in the Transformation Realm, there is no longer any need for me to return to the Martial Hall Palace. It's a pity that I can no longer keep participating in the Battle of Towns, though,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Xiang Shaoyun pondered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had no idea how long Little White would be here. His only option was to wait patiently. He was not worried about the King Realm cultivators outside at all. They wouldn't be able to go through the layer of vicious gold aura. Not even an Emperor Realm cultivator could do that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Otherwise, the Golden River Valley's secret would have been unearthed long ago. From this, it could be seen that this white tiger definitely had an extraordinary strength.</span></p>
