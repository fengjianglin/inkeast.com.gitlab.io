This news shocked the people in the Martial Hall Palace. Lu Xiaoqing challenging Mei Lianhua was still understandable since they were both among the top 10 outer peak disciples, and they were probably evenly matched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Xia Liuhui, a completely unknown person, actually dared to challenge Mo Buhui. Nobody could understand why. But when they recalled that Xia Liuhui's boss was Xiang Shaoyun, their shock lessened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Xia Liuhui and Lu Xiaoqing were challenging their respective targets, Xiang Shaoyun was at the Hall of Limits. He did not show up, not because he did not care about Xia Liuhui and Lu Xiaoqing but because he was sure they would win.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, there was also the fact that in his heart, both Mo Buhui and Mei Lianhua were two insignificant individuals not worth more of his time. Because of that, he did not bother watching the duels. His priority was still his own growth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, he broke through three limit rooms in a row, and by the time he was done, he was already in an incomparably sorry state, as he had sustained terrible injuries. The seventh and eighth rooms were supposed to be challenged by only those at the late stage of the Astral Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Xiang Shaoyun had combat prowess comparable to a late-stage Astral Realm cultivator, both those rooms weren't that hard for him. But he countered troubles in the ninth room. That was a room that generally only those at the eighth or ninth stage of the Astral Realm could survive. He suffered greatly in that room, but he eventually survived and broke through its limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he was done challenging the three rooms, he received word that Xia Liuhui and Lu Xiaoqing had both emerged victorious in their duels. Xia Liuhui's fame thus spread, and he was even accepted as a personal disciple by an elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Lu Xiaoqing, she was now known as the most outstanding female disciple after Gong Qinyin. Xiang Shaoyun was happy for them, but then again, this was a result he had expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only reason he had them challenge Mo Buhui and Mei Lianhua was to break the two's cultivation spirits, causing them to be forever stuck at the same cultivation level, to forever wallow in degeneracy from then on. Doing that was much better than giving them an easy death. More importantly, he couldn't be bothered to personally lift his finger against them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, he also feared that if he did personally move on them, he wouldn't be able to hold his anger and would end up killing them instead. If he did kill the two, it would only adversely affect his status in the Martial Hall Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps I need to start making some plans,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Xiang Shaoyun thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun spent three days recovering from his injuries. During the period, Xia Liuhui and Lu Xiaoqing did come to visit, and even some elders had come to visit him as well. Although the elders were visiting Xiang Shaoyun, their actual target was Elder Zhen Peng, as all of them wished to receive some sort of guidance in cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the three days, Palace Master Yang Gaochuan summoned Xiang Shaoyun to the meeting palace. The meeting palace was in fact a place only the elders and the higher ups of Martial Hall Palace could enter. Regular disciples were never allowed in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun had no idea why he was summoned, but the summon wasn't something he could refuse. Thus, he went as summoned. When he arrived, he found that apart from Yang Gaochuan, many elders and overseers were there, so were a few youngsters he didn't know.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Xiang Shaoyun arrived, many gazes landed on him, especially the youngsters, who were all sizing him up. He greeted the people before standing aside. A graceful figure then walked into the room. When Xiang Shaoyun saw the newcomer, his expression shifted as he thought helplessly to himself,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looks like I can't run from her forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was expecting the newcomer to start picking on him, but the newcomer merely greeted the others before standing aside as well. She did not even spare him a glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huh? Has this girl forgotten about me? But that doesn't make any sense,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Xiang Shaoyun mused inwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was at this moment that he sensed the newcomer staring daggers at him. In his astonishment, he continued his inner monologue,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shit, looks like she was only pretending to not recognize me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the others noticed that Xiang Shaoyun was staring at the newcomer without even blinking his eyes, their hearts were filled with contempt of his shamelessness. It was fine for a man to want to check out girls, but doing it so blatantly was simply shameless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Cough, cough, Xiang Shaoyun, take a seat there," Yang Gaochuan said, pulling everyone's mind back from their thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Oh, sure," Xiang Shaoyun answered, recovering from his thoughts. He then headed over to the empty seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he sat down, one of the youngsters said unhappily, "Palace master, I can't accept this. Why is he given a seat while we are left standing?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiang Shaoyun blanked out when he heard that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Xiang Shaoyun has made a unique contribution to the Martial Hall Palace. That is why he can have a seat here," Yang Gaochuan replied. He had already found out from Elder Zhen Peng that Xiang Shaoyun was the reason he had been able to enter the King Realm. That feat was considered a unique contribution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What is the unique contribution? Palace master, please clear our doubts. Perhaps we can do the same as well," the youngster pushed on. This youngster was Ye Tianlong, the personal disciple of the first elder, a seventh-stage Astral Realm expert.</span></p>

He had been filled with resentment over Xiang Shaoyun ever since then, as he felt threatened by Xiang Shaoyun. To be frank, he was merely envious of Xiang Shaoyun.</span></p>

A disciple dared to challenge a palace master like him? That disciple was thinking too highly of himself.</span></p>

"Palace master, we are all loyal disciples of the Martial Hall Palace. I am confident we can all do what he did as well. Please tell us, palace master."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then bowed deeply at Yang Gaochuan, and from how he was behaving, it was as if he would stay bowed until he was told the answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Impudent!" the first elder berated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first elder, Jie Shi, was as influential in the Martial Hall Palace as the palace master. He looked like a middle-aged man, but in truth, he was over 80 years old. He was at the peak of the Transformation Realm and was one of the few people in the Martial Hall Palace with a chance to step into the King Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Gaochuan waved his hand and said, "First elder, since he wants to know, I'll just tell him." He then looked straight at Ye Tianlong and said, "As a first-stage Astral Realm cultivator, Xiang Shaoyun had broken through four limit rooms consecutively from the third to the sixth room. Were you capable of that when you were at the same cultivation level?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At those words, shock appeared on the faces of everyone there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Tianlong also stood straight with a look of utter shock as he shouted, "No, that's not possible!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What, are you accusing me of lying to you?" Yang Gaochuan frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"No, this disciple dares not," Ye Tianlong quickly corrected himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That’s not all. When Xiang Shaoyun was still in the Basic Realm, he had broken through the first and second limit rooms. Just three days ago, he had broken through the seventh, eighth, and ninth limit rooms. He is still only a fourth-stage Astral Realm cultivator. So which of you here can do the same?" Yang Gaochuan questioned.</span></p>
