 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were three people in the cabin, one unconscious, two awake. The heavy atmosphere in the cabin turned awkward and uncertain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uh…” Xia Lei forced himself to break the silence. “About earlier, I’m sorry, I… I didn’t control myself. I’m sorry.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In actual fact, it was Long Bing who had not controlled herself. Xia Lei was smart to apologise. Women were very conscious about being forward, and him claiming to have initiated it made it less embarrassing for Long Bing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Long Bing did not let up. She glared at him. “You putting it like that seems like you’re telling me it’s a mistake, and that you’d never make the same mistake again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I…” Xia Lei wanted to say ‘yes’ but he swallowed it when he saw the hurt in Long Bing’s eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Xia Lei scrambled for words to say to calm Long Bing down, she suddenly drew close and hugged him recklessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long Bing, we… Hnng!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing had always been a woman of fewer words and more action. She was not like Jiang Ruyi, and didn’t need tears to move Xia Lei. She just needed action. There was no need to waste words with Xia Lei. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s sense of reason was under assault again, and he did his best to resist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing drew close again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stay back!” Xia Lei put both hands up to stop her and smiled wryly. “What the heck are you doing?” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing did not withdraw, and she ignored his hands. She stepped forward, and her body touched Xia Lei’s upturned hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was panicking. He back away, but only managed to move two steps before he hit the door.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing was not letting him off. She put more pressure on his hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They looked like they were in some sort of twisted fantasy martial arts movie, where combatants competed with their internal energies with their palms pressed together. Long Bing was winning, and she wasn’t even using her hands, but her breasts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing’s nose touched Xia Lei’s and she said firmly, “Remember this. You’re the first man to have slept with me, and the only one. You owe me, so don’t try to shake me off.” After a pause, she added, “Don’t even think about it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei couldn’t even begin to measure his headache.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that he thought about the time they had lived together in Germany, it had been a mission on the surface but she had not thought that way. He would have asked to act as siblings rather than a married couple if he’d known.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing released Xia Lei at last. She had been domineering, but a rare blush of embarrassment spread across her cheeks after that display of dominance was done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei sighed. “This isn’t fair to you. I’m married. I can’t give you want you want, really.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing’s gaze grew icy. “How do you know what I want? Don’t say you don’t like me. I can tell that you do. You talk about Shentu Tianyin because you’re thinking for her feelings, but have you considered my feelings? Even if Shentu Tianyin knows of my existence one day, I’ll just settle her for you if she makes trouble. She can come to me too, if she wants to rot in prison.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was speechless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He already regretted telling Long Bing about Shentu Tianyin and Gu Kewen. It had now become a card in Long Bing’s hand. He half-suspected that this very recent chain of events was because Long Bing had come to know about this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He thought of his father, Xia Changhe, for some reason at this conjecture. A voice mused in his head, ‘I wonder if Dad knows about the mess that is my love-life. What would he think about it? Never mind, he isn’t much better. I wonder if it’s inherited…’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing punched him lightly. “Speak. What do you mean by this silence?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei laughed flatly. “Is what I say important? You do what you want anyway, and I can’t stop you. I went along with you earlier when you messed with me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint smile appeared in the corners of Long Bing’s mouth, and her voice grew small too. “It was deliberate. I couldn’t help wanting to… But this place is so dirty. I don’t want my precious first time to be in a place like this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So that was why. Xia Lei let out a quiet breath of relief and thought, ‘Maybe it was just an impulse on her part. She’ll change her mind, maybe, after she calms down and the impulse passes.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing looked at Xia Lei with expectant eyes. She stopped talking, then shut her eyes, waiting for something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was an experienced man by now, and he could tell that Long Bing was waiting for him to kiss her. He hesitated. He wanted to kiss her, but he could not bring himself to take that step. When he tried, Shentu Tianyin’s face hovered before him, angry, pressuring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The motor of the fishing boat was suddenly silent, and the boat stopped. Only the waves pushed the boat forward, rocking it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Footsteps came from outside. It was not one person, but several, coming from both sides.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing’s eyes flew open. She was one of the elite agents of Bureau 101, and was able to stay alert, even in a lusty condition. She went into battle mode instantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing had only heard the footsteps, but Xia Lei had seen what was going on outside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Six Japanese men were approaching the cabin with guns in their hands. The man leading the group on the left was Takeshita Nobu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei stopped using his X-ray vision, and took out a hunting knife he had hidden at his waist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sight of the knife confirmed what Long Bing suspected. She bent and took out a hunting knife from her boot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had not brought guns because they were entering a Russian military area and also borrowing their plane. They had explicitly stated that no weapons were allowed during all these processes when the planning had been carried out. It now looked like this request of theirs had resulted in this problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knife against gun. Long Bing was an experienced fighter but she could not help being nervous still.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei took her hand gently and said in her ear, “Six people. Three on the left, three on the right. Move back. Stand behind me. I’ll get the first one and you take his gun.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing paused, and a warmth spread in her heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How much a man cared for a woman was apparent in times of danger. Xia Lei stood in front of her without hesitation in Israel, taking on the most danger for himself. He also turned the tide in their situation, even under the pressure of gunfire. He brought warmth and security to Long Bing. How could she not love a man like this?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei had already pushed Long Bing behind himself without waiting for her to decide. He stuck to the wooden wall beside the door, waiting for it to be opened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The metal lock was opened, and a sailor burst through, dashing forward before the door was fully open.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei reached out abruptly and grabbed the sailor’s right hand, stabbing his hunting knife violently into the man’s heart as he did so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first sailor to come into the cabin died in a second, but his body blocked the doorway, getting in the way of the sailors behind him&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing took the gun from the man’s hand and a gunshot rang out a second later. A bullet grazed past Xia Lei’s cheek and buried itself violently in the second sailor’s brain. Blood spurted, and the sailor fell face-up outside the cabin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only two or three seconds had passed, and they had killed two people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei and Long Bing worked perfectly in sync with each other!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin was a perfect match with Xia Lei, a Mandarin duck pair in everyday life and in their careers. However, in Xia Lei’s other identity as a bullet-dodging agent, he and Long Bing were perfect for each other. Long Bing and Xia Lei were a killer pair!&nbsp;</span></p>
