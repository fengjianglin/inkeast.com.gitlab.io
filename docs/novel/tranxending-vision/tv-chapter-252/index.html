You should’ve given me a call so that I can receive you properly.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Ding-Shan chuckled. “I came without invitation - you are not displeased, I hope, Tian-Yin?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re joking, Uncle Gu. You’re a distinguished guest. I’m glad you can come,” said Shentu Tian-Yin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Ding-Shan shook hands with Li Ming-Ji and greeted him. “When are you coming to my place for a round of golf, Old Li? I’m not pleased with my loss to you last time; I’ll win next time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Ming-Ji laughed. “No problem, but I will still win next time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Ding-Shan shook hands and greeted He Jia-Ying next. “I’ll go with you to Macau after the banquet, Old He. I’d like to play a round or two at your casino.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Jia-Ying laughed as he said, “I’ll accompany you when you come.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Ding-Shan shook his head. “I’m not playing with you. You’re a gambling king and playing with you means losing for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Jia-Ying just laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Ding-Shan then greeted the other mainlander bigwigs. He was a tycoon too, and one connected to the underworld at that. His prestige was much greater than Shentu Tian-Yin’s. These business tycoons from Hong Kong, Macau and the mainland being on close terms with him was normal. Their circles were the top of the top and Xia Lei did not have the qualifications to join them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Ding-Shan greeted everyone and Xia Lei was shafted to one side, spared not even a glance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei didn’t mind. They were arch enemies after all and he did not hope for Gu Ding-Shan to shake hands and chat with him either. There was also the thing about smiling while nursing a grudge. He did find it curious though, and thought ‘Gu Ding-Shan came uninvited - it’s not because he wanted to show his face to me, is it? If it is for this reason then he just has too much time on his hands.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Ding-Shan did glance over occasionally at Xia Lei with a faint sneer on his lips and gaze as cold as ice. His actions seemed to say: You think you can mingle with the big boys?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go have a seat, Lei.” Shentu Tian-Yin held Xia Lei’s hand. He had obviously been given the cold shoulder and ignored and she did not want him to feel uncomfortable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei smiled. “Sure.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Ding-Shan suddenly turned around and looked straight at Xia Lei and Shentu Tian-Yin. “Tian-Yin, is this person your friend? Why don’t you introduce him?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is my boyfriend, Xia Lei,” said Shentu Tian-Yin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She said it naturally and there was no wavering in her words. Xia Lei, on the other hand, was the one who felt embarrassed. He had encountered a lot of troublesome things the last time he had pretended to be Shentu Tian-Yin’s boyfriend and she was now publicly announcing that he was her boyfriend. Other troubles aside, he was sure to appear on the covers of entertainment and business magazines the next day. Shentu Tian-Yin’s fans and suitors would also scrutinise him from head to toe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was not upset at all at Shentu Tian-Yin saying that. He was already familiar with how it was like to be her fake boyfriend.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your boyfriend? Haha, I’d always thought our Ke-Wu is your boyfriend,” said Gu Ding-Shan with a laugh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shentu Tian-Yin’s brows wrinkled. “I don’t like jokes like this, Uncle Gu.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Jia-Ying laughed and said, “Tian-Yin, Old Gu is just joking with you, don’t mind it. You’re someone worth billions; who knows how many men are after you. You have to be careful and look at each suitor to make sure you’re not being fooled by some poor beggar. You need to look for a man who is suitable if you want to fall in love.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This He Jia-Ying was evidently on close terms with Gu Ding-Shan and seemed to know some of the situation, otherwise he would not show support for Gu Ding-Shan at this time. And the ‘poor beggar’ he spoke of was obviously Xia Lei. In the eyes of a big tycoon like him, a person worth two to three hundred million like Xia Lei was indeed lacking and a poor beggar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shentu Tian-Yin’s displeasure became more pronounced. “Uncle He, what do you mean by that? My boyfriend has his own company. He is not chasing after women for money, including me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So he has money. Want to go one round with me?” There was a smile on He Jia-Ying’s face but he looked at Xia Lei with challenge in his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Ke-Wu had seemingly found an opportunity to take Xia Lei down a peg and said, “Uncle He, don’t make things difficult for Mr Xia. He just has one little factory and processes parts for others. He had his factory sealed by the Trade and Commerce Bureau for a period of time too because of quality issues. He’d only just recently re-opened. Would he have money to gamble with you? I can play with you if you feel your hand’s itching to play.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No money? How can Tian-Yin’s boyfriend have no money?” Gu Ding-Shan laughed as he said, “One or two hundred million is just chump change in Tian-Yin’s eyes. Won’t she be the one taking out the cash if her boyfriend is the one gambling? Right, Tian-Yin? You won’t be a wet blanket, will you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shentu Tian-Yin’s face turned red with anger. She knew that this He Jia-Ying was skilled in the gambling field and it would just be gifting him money if Xia Lei played against him. Additionally, Gu Ding-Shan had already had some agreements with him. If Xia Lei really gambled with them, it would be like sending a lamb into the tiger’s cave or swimming into the net. However, their perception of him would worsen further if he refused - this made Shentu Tian-Yin troubled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei could see the problem too. Dirty deeds and poison went hand in hand since ancient times. Since the Gu clan came from the underworld, they cannot be without their poison of gambling, and Hai-Zhu and Macau were so close to each other so how could the both of them not know each other? These two people were now colluding with each other to get him in trouble, and in a most sinister way!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This set-up looked like a friendly jest of a bet but it was not that simple. The gambling king was going to play and with Ding-Shan acting as support, it was set in stone that Xia Lei would lose money. These people could lose or win hundreds of millions like it was nothing but Xia Lei had only that little bit on him. Once he lost, his newly-expanding business would go bust and he would disappoint Shentu Tian-Yin on top of that. Would Gu Ding-Shan still have trouble dealing with a man who had lost everything later?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lei, let’s go.” Shentu Tian-Yin wanted to take Xia Lei away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Ding-Shan mocked, “Better you go home to wash clothing and cook meals. It must be so nice to be a house-husband. Why come out a play at being a successful man?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei did not move. He said to Shentu Tian-Yin, “Tian-Yin, I’ll play with them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Shentu Tian-Yin paused. She’d never thought that Xia Lei would make a decision like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s just playing around; it’s nothing. How can I be a wet blanket when Boss Gu and Boss He are so eager to play?” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shentu Tian-Yin leaned in to Xia Lei’s ear and said a little angrily, “Can’t you see? These two are in cahoots. It’s what they do. You’ll lose horribly if you bet against them. There are many people who want to jump off buildings in Macau every day. Quite a few were like this, having their own small companies, successful careers or comfortable families but lost everything in one night. Do you want to be like them?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei just grinned. “Don’t worry, I have my limits.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Tian-Yin, find a place for us. We’ll play with Mr Xia.”&nbsp;</span></p>

She made a decision after weighing the pros and cons. “All right, come with me.” She rolled her eyes at Xia Lei when she was done talking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei pretended not to see.&nbsp;</span></p>

What card could he not see? Should he be afraid of gambling with these two? It’s wasn’t as if he did not know about Shentu Tian-Yin’s worry but explaining too much to her would make the two wiley old foxes smell a rat, and that wouldn’t be fun!</span></p>

The cardroom was well-equipped - mahjong machine, dice, pai gow, you name it, they have it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei looked about the cardroom and said, “I didn’t bring any cash. It’s all in my bank account, so how to I bet?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Jia-Ying laughed and said, “Mr Xia, did you forget what I do? I am the banker. How much do you have in your account? I can help you withdraw all of it in half an hour.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I still have about a hundred and fifty million in my account. How much are we playing for?” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>

That’s maybe about two rounds.” He Jia-Ying talked big. He waved his hand and one of his subordinates walked to Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mr Xia, I will help you withdraw the money from your bank account. One hundred and fifty million. I suggest you convert the amount into denominations of 500 Euros. It will be easier to work with the converted amount,” said the subordinate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei nodded. “Okay, How will you convert it?”&nbsp;</span></p>

If we change it all to 500 Euro bills, that will be 42,360 bills. Every bill weighs 1.1 grams, so the total is 46,596 grams. Do you find this too troublesome, Mr Xia?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, not at all. But is the money being withdrawn from you? I have to see where the money is, right?” said Xia Lei casually.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We have our rules, of course.” The subordinate took out his phone and made a call. He said just one line into the phone. “Bring the money up.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Ding-Shan also made a call and he said ‘bring it here’.&nbsp;</span></p>

Don’t you see? They’ve even had the money prepared - this is obviously a set-up.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei smiled and said, “It’s fine. It’s just playing around. I don’t play cards often; I’d like to play.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Your money is for expanding your business, and your employees are waiting for you to give them their wages. Have you thought about what you’d do if you lost all your money? What about your company?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How do you know I’ll lose when I haven’t started playing? Don’t keep saying I’ll lose - it’ll affect my hand,” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>Hello~!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>We have 48 chapters more to go to chapter 300 so here I am casting the net for some ideas on what to do for this happy event.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ideas I have so far:&nbsp;</p>
 <p>1) Doing a live-reading of chapter 300 on Discord. (There is a voice-channel called 'storytelling'.)</p>
 <p>2) Another Q&amp;A with me :D</p>
 <p>3) I'll sing 3 songs of your choosing (top 3 highest-voted in comments) on Discord. Any language, as long as it's not something impossible like dubstep or inhumane screeching.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Get voting, get commenting, keep the suggestions coming till the last day of September 2018!</p>
