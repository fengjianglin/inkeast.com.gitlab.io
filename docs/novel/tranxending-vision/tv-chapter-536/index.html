 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you standing around for?” The man shouted at the Self Defence soldiers. “Go drag that woman out! I want to kill her in front of this guy!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soldiers who had received orders still stood in their spots. It was like they didn’t hear him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In actual fact, they could not hear anything anymore. Princess Yongmei had done something terrible to them just before the man had barked his orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Xia Lei could see it happening. Princess Yongmei was like the wind, blowing past the deck. All the soldiers on the deck fell prey to her hands. One by one, they grew blank, sightless, expressionless, and motionless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bastard!” The man grew mad. He walked over and kicked one of the soldiers who were not listening to his commands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soldier fell to the deck, motionless. He stared blankly up at the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong with you?” The man paused. He suddenly realised something, and he looked about to see that everyone was in a similar state. It was like they had lost their souls, leaving an empty shell of themselves behind, not hearing, and not responding to any stimuli.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Terror abruptly took hold of his heart, and the man looked at Xia Lei in horror. He forgot what he wanted to say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, in Xia Lei’s field of vision, Princess Yongmei used the same method to wipe out the drivers of the speed boats. The specialised male agent was the only one left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Yongmei returned to the deck, but she did not make a move on the last target.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wh, What did you do to them?” The man came back to his senses. His voice shook from nervousness and terror.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei got to his feet and said evenly, “I’ve been under your watch all this while. What could I have done?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then what’s wrong with them?” screamed the man at Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei gave a laugh. “This must be retribution. The Heavens are punishing them. It’s nothing to do with me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man abruptly drew his gun&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was faster. He kicked the man’s wrist, and the gun he had just drawn was sent flying, dropping into the sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man swung a fist at Xia Lei’s head. Xia Lei raised his elbow to block, and did a jab after blocking the blow. His jab hit the man on his heart, and there was a thud. The man’s heart was shaken, and he folded, collapsing to the deck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei moved quickly, miraculously fast. When he stopped moving, one of his legs was stepping on the agent’s chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The agent struggled for a bit, but Xia Lei’s leg was like the tyre of a huge truck pressing down on him. He could not move. He realised then that this Chinese spy who had pretended to be a fool was actually an expert, and one more skilled than he!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei looked at Princess Yongmei. “Why did you leave him alone?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I left him to you. I want to see how good you are,” said Princess Yongmei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei laughed dryly. “So what is your conclusion?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Yongmei pursed her lips. “Unimpressive. Any bodyguard of mine in my time would be able to defeat you easily.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei had no response to that, but he believed what Princess Yongmei said. Martial arts was one of China’s cultural identities, but it had deteriorated over time because of various reasons. Princess Yongmei’s era had been one where martial arts had flourished, and was in its prime. His most familiar Wing Chun would probably not be seen as one of the main schools of martial art in that time period. How would he be able to defeat a Ming dynasty princess’s bodyguards?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now, kill him for me,” said Princess Yongmei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill him for you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, kill him for me!” Princess Yongmei’s voice carried a command – the command of a princess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei did not move. He heard the command in her tone, and he was uncomfortable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a modern man, and Princess Yongmei was a Ming dynasty princess. Why would he follow the orders of a Ming dynasty princess? Besides, he was of the opinion that Princess Yongmei had had their roles reversed. He was the only person in this world who could release her from that void!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, he was Princess Yongmei’s master, not her slave!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Didn’t you hear me?” Princess Yongmei was mad that her order had not been followed, and her tone of command grew stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei gave a laugh. “Are you giving me orders?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You–” Princess Yongmei glared at Xia Lei. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The agent felt like he was falling apart. He roared, “Who the fuck are you talking to, you bastard! Are you insane?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei raised a leg and released the agent, then said, “Zhu Xuanyue, kill him!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Humph! You’re giving me orders?” Princess Yongmei sneered, “I’ve already killed several. I left one for you to kill, but you’re telling me to do it, and with this commanding tone too! Realise this – I am a Ming princess!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Ming dynasty’s reign ended hundred of years ago,” said Xia Lei. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did you say?” Princess Yongmei’s mouth fell open.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I said that the Ming dynasty is dead. Dead for hundreds of years!” Xia Lei did not hold back. “So your status of princess means nothing to me. What you need to understand is that YOU have to follow my orders, and not me who has to follow your orders!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Yongmei froze. She said nothing, and did nothing. She was best at extinguishing a person’s soul, and performing traceless murders, but she herself seemed like she had lost her soul right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei felt a little sorry for at when he saw her reaction, but he had to harden his heart and do this. The Zhu Xuanyue right now was very dangerous. She was emotional, and lost control easily. He had to keep her under control, subdue her, and make her listen to his commands, or Princess Yongmei would not be a help, but a nightmare!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who the fuck are you talking to? My men… my men… What happened to them? Tell me! Tell me what happened!” &nbsp;The agent was falling apart again. To him, it looked like Xia Lei was talking to empty air, and telling that empty air to kill him. How could he bear a situation such as this!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut your mouth!” shouted Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The agent sudden;y rushed at a Self Defence soldier, reaching for a gun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei grabbed him by the throat, and stomped. The agent fell to the deck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can’t kill me!” shouted the agent. “I am a military man of the Japanese Empire! If you kill me, it will mean war! Will you be able to bear the consequences?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei sneered, “You think it’s still World War Two right now? You think I will scramble to apologise to you because you said that? Let me tell you that you’re going to die, but I just don’t want to dirty my hands. My friend will do this for me.” He looked at Princess Yongmei. “Zhu Xuanyue, you will kill him for me, won’t you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhu Xuanyue hesitated, and floated slowly over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint smile appeared in the corners of Xia Lei’s lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was actually as easy as pie for Xia Lei to kill this agent, and he could do it without breaking a sweat. He wanted Princess Yongmei to kill the agent for two reasons. One, was that he needed Princess Yongmei to obey, and make her his helper instead of his problem. The other reason was that if he killed the agent, he would leave traces of the killing. These traces could end up causing international disputes, especially on the military front. This problem would not occur if Princess Yongmei were to do the deed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Yongmei reached her hands out to the agent, but stopped at his forehead. She stared at Xia Lei with eyes of ice. “Just this one time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei did not speak. He just watched Princess Yongmei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill me! Go on, kill me! You lost your nerve, didn’t you? Chinese–” The voice vanished from the agent’s throat before the cursing was complete. His eyes instantly went blank, becoming nothing. His breathing ceased, too. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the closest Xia Lei had been in witnessing Princess Yongmei kill someone. However, though it was happening right in front of him, he could not see the finer mechanisms of how it was done. He only saw Princess Yongmei reach her hands into the agent’s head, and the agent was dead. The entire process, from beginning to end, took less than a second!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Yongmei right now was, beyond doubt, almost complete, and terrifyingly powerful!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Yongmei moved two steps back. “All right, are you satisfied now?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you.” Xia Lei thanked her, then took off his jacket and wiped at the footprint he had left on the agent’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He must not leave any traces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These bodies would be discovered eventually, but no one would be able to trace him. What happened here would have to become one of the unsolved mysteries of the Japanese military.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Yongmei’s gaze went to Xia Lei’s necklace. She still desired the AE capsule.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei pretended not to see, and he said softly, “I’ll have to put their bodies back on their boats, then leave this place. Let’s have a good talk on the way back. I’ve been wanting to talk with you for a while, but you were not in a very stable condition.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s no problem. I’ll wait for you.” Princess Yongmei was very calm this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei got to work quickly. He moved all of the corpses of the Self Defence soldiers back to their military speed boats, then drove the yacht towards China.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surveillance ship Shi Boren had promised was still nowhere in sight, but Xia Lei did not need it anymore. Before he started his talk with Princess Yongmei, he gave Shi Boren a call to tell him to stop the ship from coming over. Doing this was also a precaution, so that the Japanese side would not have any evidence to gather.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his call, Shi Boren asked why the ship was no longer needed, but Xia Lei just that they managed to lose their pursuers. He said nothing else about what had happened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He believed that the Japanese military would not report the dead bodies after finding them, and even if there was an investigation, it would be covert. He would be able to avoid a lot of trouble this way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he ended his call with Shi Boren, Xia Lei asked Princess Yongmei his first question. “Tell me – what are you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
