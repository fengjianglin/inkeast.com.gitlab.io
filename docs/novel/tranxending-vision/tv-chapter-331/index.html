 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an extra special passenger onboard - Shi Bo-Ren.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bo-Chuan and Long Bing were on the flight too, and Dayetia and Szlamy. The two White Hun women were under watch and not allowed to go near Shi Bo-Ren and Xia Lei, who were having a talk.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dayetia held the wooden box containing the sword of Attila tight. The thing in the box was more valuable than her own life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Szlamy blinked her large blue eyes, staring at Xia Lei and Shi Bo-Ren a-ways off. She seemed to be trying to guess at what the two men were talking about. However, this was a mission too impossible for her brains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Truthfully, she didn’t know what was going on in her head either…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Bo-Ren’s voice was fairly low. “Look, you’ve completed such a difficult mission. We cannot just leave you alone. I’ve already sent a report to the higher-ups to give the green light to your military factory in a show of appreciation for your success. Your factory can start production soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei laughed dryly. “I was supposed to go to Afghanistan after the ribbon-cutting ceremony but you guys said that time was tight and that I had to go to Afghanistan immediately. I’ve done all that I could, and I want to say this clearly - this is the last time I’ll participate in a mission for you guys. Don’t come looking for me for this sort of thing in the future. Modifying guns or something else are no problem and I can help you out anytime but no more things like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Bo-Ren’s brows wrinkled. “Your talents should be used for the country, and the country also needs talents like you. I’ll pretend I didn’t hear what you said, and don’t talk about it again. The country will not treat you badly if you work for it. Look, how about this - I’ll talk to the higher-ups after we’re back. We’ll first put down a big purchase order for your military factory. Ten thousand guns or something, for your workers to practice and break in your machines. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ten thousand guns… at 2,000 per gun the purchase order would be worth 20,000,000. A big order like this meant that the employees and machines of Thunder Horse Military Factory would not stand idle and go straight to production. Furthermore, this was also at a stage where the factory was still not producing high-performance sniper rifles. An order like this was definitely a reward and a great support to his business; it was significant to Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A straight rejection of Shi Bo-Ren could mean this big order going out the window. Plus, he hadn’t had time to modify the lathes yet so that they could produce high-performance sniper rifles. He had already invested a billion in the military factory so he couldn’t let that money just sit there, could he? Besides, the new hires and workers had to be paid and insurances too - all these were a great expense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boss Shi, are you trying to tempt me?” said Xia Lei half-jokingly. He could not reject the purchase order Shi Bo-Ren was proposing but he did not immediately show interest. He asked probingly, “Tell me, what do you want me to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Bo-Ren gave a laugh. “This mission is not dangerous. You can just hand it in and it’s done.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei was struck by a thought and he could probably guess what mission Shi Bo-Ren wanted to give him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s people to be rescued but you can’t come back after you’ve rescued them,” said Shi Bo-Ren, “Tang Yu-Yan will bring the experts back. Long Bing and Tang Bo-Chuan will assist so you don’t have to worry about that. What you need to do is to stay and excavate that ancient city. Find what’s in it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All right, I’ll do it.” This was what Xia Lei had planned on doing anyway and agreeing meant a purchase order for guns. He agreed without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Bo-Ren looked straight at Xia Lei. “You know what you’re going to excavate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei smiled. “Don’t forget that Ning Jing and I are good friends. I met her in the tribe and she told me about it. I don’t know much though. I just know that the compass has to be used to find the spot to excavate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pretending not to know was unnecessary and a low-level mistake. Who was Shi Bo-Ren? The boss of intelligence agents. It would not be smart at all to put on an act in front of him. Besides, Tang Yu-Yan knew something too so there was no hiding it. It was better to tell the truth since it was like that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, a small smile appeared in the corners of Shi Bo-Ren’s mouth. “You’re right. We do need that compass. You were the one who fixed it too, so you should know how to use it. Remember - you must complete this mission no matter what&nbsp;and no matter the cost. And what you dig up must be all be brought back to China.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No problem.” After a pause, Xia Lei asked probingly, “Boss Shi, can you give me more details?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Bo-Ren’s expression grew grave. “You only need to complete your mission. As for what that thing is and what it’s used for - there’s no need for you to know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The answer was as expected. Xia Lei didn’t pursue the matter. “Okay, I know what I should do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can ask for anything you need; don’t hold back. I will fulfil your request as long as it’s related to the mission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei thought for a bit and said, “We need to be on friendly terms with the White Hun Tribe if we can to complete this mission. I’ve promised to build them a hydropower station in exchange for the hostages, and gifts of household appliances like rice cookers, kettles and such. I’ve tasked my assistant with these purchases but it is difficult to ship things to that place. Boss Shi, is there any way you can ship these items to them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No problem. Ship the things to Pakistan, then we’ll airlift them over,” said Boss Shi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Afghanistan’s airspace is almost completely controlled by American troops. Will you be able to airlift them?” asked Xia Lei worriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The American troops are not all-encompassing. You don’t have to worry about this. Just wait to receive your equipment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei was relieved. Who knew how much time and money it would cost him if he were to have to ship the equipment needed for the hydropower station to the White Hun Tribe himself. It was a relief to hear Shi Bo-Ren’s words. This was the advantage of the country getting stronger - having the backing of a strong country while doing something like this did make him feel rather proud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two men continued their discussion of the details of the mission.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The military plane landed in the military base at the border of Xinjiang province.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Bo-Chuan gave Xia Lei, Dayetia and Szlamy sets of traditional Afghan clothing in the military base. After they changed into them, a Bureau 101 makeup artist put makeup on them. Xia Lei’s skin was muddied and wrinkles were drawn on, plus a face full of thick beard. He looked like a genuine middle-aged Afghan man after the headscarf was added.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dayetia and Szlamy’s makeup was more complicated. The makeup artist added years to them and also made them uglier. The traditional black robes and black headscarf allowed just their eyes to peek out. If anyone had designs on them and pulled their headscarves off, the ugly old wrinkly faces would put the man off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dayetia and Szlamy’s warhorses were also returned to them, and their AK47s. The guns, however, were hidden in their luggage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei received the most equipment. Other than his sniper rifle, he had reconnaissance and assassination equipment, making him Bureau 101’s ‘007’. He also had communications devices; two satellite phones and several spare batteries. With these, he could communicate with them in China while in the White Hun Tribe and he wouldn’t have to worry about running out of battery or having no signal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All preparations complete, they were just about to leave when Long Bing called Xia Lei to one side and nagged, “Be careful. We’ve made preparations but you cannot let down your guard, especially after Tang Yu-Yan takes the experts with her. You’ll be alone in the tribe. You must take good care of yourself; don’t lose your life there.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei was quite touched. He nodded. “I will. You take care of yourself too. Don’t be too reckless; living is most important.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Bing smiled faintly but her smile disappeared in a flash. “I’ll tell you a little something about Shentu Tian-Yin.

I’ll go talk with her when I’m back. I owe her an explanation.” Xia Lei still felt some guilt, since he had used Shentu Tian-Yin’s connections in this mission to steal the sword of Attila.</span></p>

All Afghan airports were under American surveillance and there were as many intelligence agents in the airports as hairs on a cow’s hide. The mission would fail if they were discovered. No one would be able to bear that outcome. The route through the Wakhan Corridor would require more time but was much safer. The shipping of the equipment needed for the hydropower station in the plan also needed much planning and preparation, and they could not just airlift things as and when they liked.&nbsp;</span></p>

He is against it but I pushed for it and he agreed in the end.” Xia Lei smiled and said, “Soon, you’ll be able to use electricity. Meals cooked with electricity, water heated with electricity. You’ll be able to sleep under electric-heated blankets too in cold winters.”&nbsp;</span></p>
