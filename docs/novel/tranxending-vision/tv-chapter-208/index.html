Time to eat.” Xia Lei walked out of the kitchen with freshly-cooked carrot-and-ribs soup, calling Liang Zheng-Chun and Liang Si-Yao to come eat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Zheng-Chun smiled wryly and shook his head. He could now see that his prestige as Master was far lower-ranked than his daughter. He had told Liang Si-Yao to make dinner and she had told Xia Lei to make dinner, then… dinner was ready.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them sat around a table and ate and drank merrily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Si-Yao picked a kidney from the red simmer-fried chicken with her chopsticks and put it in Xia Lei’s bowl. “You’re injured so you have to eat more. Nourish yourself.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei felt rather ill when he looked at the white chicken kidney in his bowl. He had a wound on his leg - how was eating chicken kidney for nourishment going to help?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Si-Yao picked up a piece of potato and put it in Liang Zheng-Chun’s bowl. “Have more vegetables, Dad.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Zheng-Chun rolled his eyes at Liang Si-Yao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Si-Yao was quite pleased with herself. “Wish I was there too to see you defeat that arrogant American. You must’ve been so dashing then.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei smiled wryly. He knew clearly the danger he was in back then and the brute strength that person had. He could not even beat Liang Zheng-Chun so how could he beat Bruce Long, who had defeated him? He could do so only thanks to the power of his left eye and the time he had spent researching acupuncture points. He had actually had the idea to attack Bruce Long’s Shanzhong point even before Liang Zheng-Chun had gone into the ring to fight him because that point was easiest to attack and could fell a foe in one move. When he had gone up the platform, he had feigned weakness in the beginning, only defending and seeking for an opportunity to attack. Dong Wu had then reminded Bruce Long of his injured leg and Bruce Long focused on his leg afterwards. He had let him attack his leg repeatedly and waited for Bruce Long to extend himself before he made his move, attacking his Shanzhong point and finishing the fight. If he had made the slightest mistake during this whole process, there would have been a possibility of him being beaten into the platform. The result was fairly difficult to predict.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was just no way he could tell either Liang Zheng-Chun or Liang Si-Yao of this process.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Zheng-Chun looked at Xia Lei. “Right, Lei, Lu Sheng was present when we were on our way back so it was not convenient to ask… We are all family here now so tell me - how did you defeat that American?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei extended his right fist and made his knuckle stick out. “I hit his Shanzhong acupuncture point with my fist like this, and he fell.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Acupuncture point?” Liang Zheng-Chun looked surprised. “Even I can’t do that and you’ve already learnt it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei smiled as he said, “Master, I am learning about medicine. Your study has some volumes on acupuncture and moxibustion and I read those. I knew what attacking that acupuncture point would do because I learnt acupuncture. I didn’t learn any acupuncture martial art - I just used my knowledge of acupuncture in Wing Chun.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Si-Yao spoke too, “Dad, Lei learns super fast. He can build the most advanced lathe from Germany with his own two hands. Oh, and he also cured Shentu Tian-Yin’s father. That guy was paralysed for three years and he used acupuncture to heal him. He’s so awesome; incorporating acupuncture in our Wing Chun is not strange.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Zheng-Chun did not find it strange how Xia Lei was able to do so many miraculous things but felt rather proud. He pondered for a bit, and a smile spread across his face. “I already knew about your learning capabilities but it’s greater that I’d thought. Using acupuncture in Wing Chun doesn’t seem so strange now that I think about it.” He raised his cup. “Beautifully done. A toast from your Master.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Xia Lei could drink, Liang Si-Yao said, “Dad, don’t make him drink so much. If he drinks too much it’ll… be bad.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Would drinking too much affect something? Her word-stumble made one’s head fill with thoughts. Xia Lei still drank in the end. It was a toast from his Master and he would drink it even if Liang Si-Yao did not like the alcohol on his breath. He’d just hold a piece of xylitol in his mouth when kissing...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After dinner, Liang Zheng-Chun retired early to bed - this had nothing to do with being an early bird and everything to do with not wanting to be a third wheel. He was very satisfied with Xia Lei’s character and other characteristics and Xia Lei had also challenged Bruce Long on his account despite the danger to himself. That had made him like Xia Lei even more and there was nothing he could find wrong with him anymore. What was there to be unhappy or dissatisfied with as a father when he could hand his daughter over to a man like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Si-Yao went to the kitchen to wash the dishes and Xia Lei stayed in her room to use her notebook computer to research guns. The martial arts seminar was over and his attention went back to the matter of modifying the sniper rifle for Long Bing. Long Bing would help him settle his issues whenever he gave her a call so he naturally did his best when she asked for his help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Modifying a sniper rifle to become better than the best was not so difficult for Xia Lei but the manual Long Bing had included in the box for him was definitely not enough.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His internet search results for modifying guns were mostly related to games and the information on modifying game guns were definitely not useable in real life. Xia Lei then gave up and searched for information about sniper rifles. He found some leads this time and the information he got was detailed and professional. He could understand the workings of a sniper rifle from what he’d found and the performance index, structure and so on. Once Xia Lei had a grasp on this knowledge, he would gain a better understanding of the sniper rifle and make his job of modifying the sniper rifle much easier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His phone suddenly rang while he was reading up on sniper rifles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei took his phone out, looked at the screen and smiled. He unlocked the phone to receive the call. “Hey, where have you gone off to die while I was away? Closed-door training, oh maaan, I’m so tired I could die. I’ve become so tanned too! Let me tell you, that instructor was super abnormal - I suspect she’s got some mental illness... ” Jiang Ru-Yi’s voice came from the phone like a tap which had been turned on, the water flowing continuously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei had a feeling of fondness as he listened to her prattle; he hadn’t heard from her in a long time. He listened patiently, saying a few words now and then, and seemed to enjoy it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After spewing a load of crap, Jiang Ru-Yi suddenly changed the topic. “Where’d you die off to? I knocked for so long but there was no response. I’ll splash paint on your door next time if you don’t open it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you have paint?” asked Xia Lei laughingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No…” Jiang Ru-Yi snorted, “I can go buy some! If not, I can splash soy sauce on your door!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei was speechless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was the same as always and the long training hadn’t changed her one bit. He didn’t know if Jiang Ru-Yi’s instructor really had a mental illness but he was sure she had frequent headaches.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, talk. Where did you go? I haven’t seen you in a while. I want to see you and give you a good scolding.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei laughed dryly. “You want to see me to scold me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Ru-Yi spoke matter-of-factly, “Of course. I feel uncomfortable not scolding you for such a long time. See, aren’t I too good to you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry at that logic. “I actually want to tell you a piece of good news.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you going to buy me a nice car or a big house?” Jiang Ru-Yi giggled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll buy you one if you like it. Really. I made a lot of money and was thinking of getting something for you but you weren’t around,” said Xia Lei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, that really is good news. I want a house, I want a car, I want… Whatever! Buy, buy, buy!” Jiang Ru-Yi seemed rather excited.&nbsp;</span></p>

Weird.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not take what Jiang Ru-Yi said to heart, though. She had ‘cut ties’ with him over a thousand times from when they were children growing up together. The longest she had ‘cut ties’ was just three days, and she had enticed him to take the initiative to talk to her with ice-cream. Thinking about this made him feel warm and amused.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Si-Yao walked through the door at that moment and asked with a smile, “Who were you on the phone with?”&nbsp;</span></p>

She doesn’t know that we’re together now?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She knows. I told her but she didn’t seem happy about it,” said Xia Lei from the sofa.&nbsp;</span></p>

She climbed onto Xia Lei’s lap, then pressed her body against his and said gently in his ear, “Let’s not talk about her. You weren’t by my side last night - I missed you the whole night.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Si-Yao was a fascinating, pretty young thing. Her softness and her mesmerising smell, coupled with her long legs spread wide open made Xia Lei’s loins heat up. It felt like a flame burning quietly and it made his mouth go dry; he was restless and eager to do something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go to the bed.” Xia Lei had zero resistance to Liang Si-Yao.&nbsp;</span></p>

I want to reward you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Reward?” Xia Lei looked at her uncomprehendingly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a small ‘schlick’ as Liang Si-Yao sheathed the sword.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was the first time in his life that he’d tasted such a thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Jiang Ru-Yi threw a soy sauce at Xia Lei’s door. She was still mad, so she grabbed two sanitary napkins and stuck them on his door in a cross. She then stared dumbly at the hideous mess of a door as tears rolled silently down her cheeks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Love was like this. While someone tasted bliss, another was left hurt in a lonely corner.</span></p>
