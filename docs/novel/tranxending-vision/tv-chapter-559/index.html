 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei didn’t dare look closely at the contents of the note in front of so many people, especially when there were special agents from Bureau 101. He put the red envelope away after discovering that there was a slip of paper inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Ren gave Xia Lei a red envelope too, and it held the registration papers for a private plane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s betrothal gift was a wall of gold while Shentu Ren’s dowry for Shentu Tianyin was a Boeing 747. This was called give-and-take. However, Xia Lei’s betrothal gift was grander because it was worth one billion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Groom and Bride, bow to each other and enter the bridal room—” The MC announced ceremoniously. The ceremony was complete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei and Shentu Tianyin wouldn’t do it in the Jingdu International Convention and Exhibition Centre, of course; this was only a formality. The two of them entered the changing room. Shentu Tianyin did not avoid Xia Lei, and took off her traditional Chinese clothing and accessories, with him right next to her. She left just a purple bra and small underwear on. Her body was as fair as jade and well-rounded in all the right places. She pulled the wedding dress to herself and made to put it on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei said, “It’s so cold so don’t wear the wedding dress. Why don’t you wear some cotton clothes? Don’t freeze.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s all right. Today is a happy day for both of us. Of course I have to wear a wedding dress. I’m only going to wear this once in my life, so I’d still be willing to wear it no matter how cold it is. There’s air conditioning too, so don’t worry,” said Shentu Tianyin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei laughed. “As you wish, then.” He took off his traditional clothing and accessories too, and changed into a suit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right, Hubby. Your Master…” Shentu Tianyin asked probingly, “How come he’s here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was her second time asking this question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei laughed dryly. “I don’t know either. He went to America and we haven’t contacted each other for a long time. This is the first time I’ve seen him since he went to America.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So you mean you didn’t give him an invitation? Then how did he get in here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei thought for a moment. “I think it’s probably because of Lu Sheng. Lu Sheng is my sister’s bodyguard and the Chief of my security department. He’s also my Master’s disciple. He sent out some of the invitations for the wedding.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then…” Shentu Tianyin hesitated before saying, “Is your Sister Disciple, Liang Siayo, here as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was actually what Shentu Tianyin was trying to get at. She wasn’t worried about Liang Zhengchun, she was only worried about Liang Siyao, the woman who had snatched Xia Lei away from her in the past. He had been snatched away from her once, and she definitely wouldn’t allow it to happen a second time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei embraced her and said gently, “Tianyin, I know what you’re worried about. There’s no need to worry. I have nothing to do with her now. Even if she was here, it wouldn’t affect us at all. I love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. No one can separate us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin smiled a small smile and kissed Xia Lei on the cheek. “I love you too. Let’s go out. You invited so many prominent figures. We have to drink with them and toast to them. We must not slight anyone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After they exited the changing room, Xia Lei said, “Tianyin, wait for me. I have to go to the restroom.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure.” Shentu Tianyin stayed in the corridor to wait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei entered the bathroom and opened the red envelope which Liang Zhengchun had given him. He pulled out the piece of paper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On that piece of paper was Liang Siyao’s note:&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lei, today is a happy day for you. I give you and Shentu Tianyin my blessings. I’ve hurt you, but please believe me, and believe that I definitely wasn’t willing to do that. I am not hoping that you would forgive me, but… Are you going to punish me for the rest of my life because of my identity?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I know something happened to your body and I also know you have a problem. Do you still remember the fluids I took from you, and your blood? The AE Research Center focused on those things and they have already come up with some preliminary findings. Would you like to know what they’ve found? Let’s meet. If you agree, just tell my dad “I forgive you” and I will find a time to show up in front of you.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Forever loving you,</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Siyao</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the content of the message.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei ripped the paper up and threw it into the toilet when he was done reading it. He flushed, then stared at the toilet in a daze. His heart was far from calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘She’s already in China? According to what I know of the intelligence system of Bureau 101, it’s impossible for them to be unaware of her identity now that things have come this far. It’s a great risk for her to sneak back into China. Did she take such a huge risk to come see me because she wants me to forgive her, or because the AE Research Center discovered something, and she wants to tell me about it?’ Xia Lei kept thinking and rethinking this matter, but he could not decide.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao knew about the secret of AE. She did not know all of it, but she was quite clear on what it was. The fluids she wrote about had been obtained through the hot nights he had shared with her back when they were full of passion for each other, then hidden these fluids and stored them. She had brought up the fluids and also written that she was willing to help him. Even though she didn’t state what the problem was, Xia Lei knew. The problem was that he could not impregnate women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘She says she wants to help me solve my problem but how is she going to solve it? And what did the AE Research Center find?’ These questions plagued Xia Lei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to know the answer to so many questions, but all of these answers could only be found through one way, and that was Liang Siyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hubby, are you okay?” Shentu Tianyin’s voice came from outside the bathroom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei then snapped back to his senses. He gave a noise in response and walked out of the bathroom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did you take so long?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, my stomach didn’t feel so good,” said Xia Lei as he took Shentu Tianyin’s hand and walked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hubby, there’s something…” Shentu Tianyin started to say something, and stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My father has asked me this several times. He asked me if we’re avoiding getting pregnant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was thrown off for a second, and he asked awkwardly, “How…did you respond?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin said, “I said that we were not doing that. Think about it. If I said that we are, I’d definitely get scolded by him. He loves me dearly, but he’s very serious about this and he has almost gone mad with the wish of having a grandchild to hold. Hubby, we’ve lived together for some time now but my womb has not had any reaction so far. It’s probably some problem with me. I want to go to the hospital to do a checkup. How about you come with me and get examined too while you’re at it? How about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei knew that this had been worded very tactfully. Shentu Tianyin had been with him for several months and done the deed more times than he count count. They had not used protection at all. Under normal circumstances, her belly should have long become big with child, but it had not. She was someone who had a private doctor too, so how could she not have had a checkup, especially when it had been so long?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t difficult to guess what the results of the doctor’s check had been. Shentu Tianyin definitely wouldn’t have any problems. The problem lay with him. However, she was afraid that she would hurt Xia Lei’s dignity if she just spoke plainly about it since all men were more sensitive when it came to things like this. This was why she had used this tactful method to broach the subject and get Xia Lei checked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First was Jiang Ruyi’s mistake in thinking she was pregnant, and Shentu Tianyin had brought it up again now. The previously unnoticed problem of infertility had floated up to the surface. Xia Lei was not concerned about his manly dignity, but his had a very real and definite headache now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Um, if you don’t want to… it’s fine too.” Shentu Tianyin was afraid of triggering Xia Lei and making him unhappy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei laughed. “It’s not a problem. We definitely can’t do it today. Let’s find another time to go do a checkup. It might not be a problem with you. It could be me who has a problem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Shentu Tianyin relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“By the way, if it is my problem…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then we shall seek treatment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What if it can’t get better?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin quirked her lips. “Technology has become so advanced now. If we can’t treat it in China, we can go abroad. It can definitely be cured.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei didn’t say things like ‘What if it can’t get better abroad’ because he had already seen that Shentu Tianyin’s spirits had become rather apparently low, and that she was a little unhappy. A woman’s greatest dream was to marry someone who she loved, and have their own children. This was how a woman’s life would be complete. She would surely be unhappy if he couldn’t get her pregnant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Forget it. There are some risks, but I should still go see her. I hope she will be able to help me solve this problem. This pressure from my father-in-law and wife is enough to make my head hurt.’ Xia Lei had made his decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The banquet began. Shentu Tianyin had hired almost all of the famous chefs of Jingdu for this wedding. She was fine with spending however much money she needed to; she only wanted the best. Her man was the best man in the whole world, so her banquet had to be the best too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were too many guests so Xia Lei and Shentu Tianyin couldn’t go up to every single table to drink a toast with them. Xia Lei did what the MC suggested, and drank three cups in a row to toast everyone present. However, he couldn’t slight Ling Han, the prominent military figures, and that ambassador and Arab prince, so he still had to personally go drink with them, and he took Shentu Tianyin with him to honour these esteemed guests.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Xia Lei brought Shentu Tianyin to Liang Zhengchun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, I’ll pour you a cup of wine. Let’s drink together,'' said Xia Lei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Zhengchun laughed. “Then I’ll drink all the wine in my cup. If you pour me some more, I’ll drink with you some more.” After saying this, Liang Zhengchun picked up his wine cup and tilted his head back to drink it in one gulp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei picked up the wine bottle and poured some more wine for him. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he lowered his voice and said, “I forgive you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Zhengchun paused, but he quickly reacted and laughed as he nodded. “All right, all right. I’m just overjoyed today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, a toast.” Xia Lei touched cups with Liang Zhengchun, and finished the wine in his cup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Zhengchun finished the wine in his cup and laughed as he said, “I wanted to drink a lot with you today, but you have to drink more, so I won’t ask for that. Go on, go on, go about your duties. You don’t have to take care of me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, where are you staying now?” asked Xia Lei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Zhengchun said, “I just returned. I contacted Lu Sheng and he told me about you getting married. This Master here turned up uninvited.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, please don’t say it that way. I feel so ashamed when you put it that way.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, I’m preparing to go back to Haizhu, and to live there for a period of time. I’ll be at the same old place. Come see me when you have the time,” said Liang Zhengchun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I will definitely be there,” said Xia Lei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After they left Liang Zhengchun’s table, Shentu Tianyin tugged at Xia Lei’s sleeve and said softly, “Take me too when you go to his house. I want to go too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was speechless.</span></p>
