 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Less than 30 seconds had passed since Sylvia had collapsed after drinking the beer. This was no ordinary sleeping drug, but a powerful one which could knock people out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From this, Xia Lei could more or less confirm that this Sylvia definitely had some other identity, other than her identity as the chief machinist of Rheinmetall AG.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sylvia sprawled on the sofa, her legs wide open in an inelegant pose. Her black g-string was exposed to Xia Lei’s view, and it was pulled tight, but pulled askew such that parts which should be kept hidden threatened to peek out, oh so lewdly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her sexiness was a deadly temptation to any man, and this was one such situation right now. She was unconscious and doing nothing, but Xia Lei still found it hard to wrench himself out of his state of excitement and his impulse to do something to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei moved close, to Sylvia’s ear and said softly, “Miss Sylvia, what’s wrong?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no response from Sylvia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei checked her carotid artery for her pulse, then her breathing. After he’d confirmed that her life was in no danger, he reached down and adjusted that black g-string for her. He then went straight to her study.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whatever additional identity this Sylvia had, Xia Lei was still going to open that safe and have a look. Why? Simple. Whether Sylvia was CIA or a free agent of the FA, she was still a chief machinist of Rheinmetall AG, and she had real skill. The competition of skills a week ago was proof of that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A ‘zzz zz zz’ sound came from her room as he walked past it. It was the vibration of a phone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was struck by a thought, and he entered Sylvia’s room. He quickly found the Blackberry phone in the pocket of the black trench coat, and he saw a message when he touched the display screen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The message read: Babe, you did it yet?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sender of the message was saved as ‘My True Love’ by Silvia, and the country code showed that the message was from an American number.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei opened up the phone’s message inbox and saw more messages between Sylvia and ‘My True Love’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My True Love: Babe, I’m in a tough spot now. You have to help me. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sylvia: What trouble are you in, my Darling?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My True Love: Babe, really, if I don’t do well this time they’ll kill me.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sylvia: OMG, WHAT?! What did you get yourself into?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My True Love: I can’t tell you now, Babe. A Chinese guy is coming to your company. His name’s Xia Lei. Find some way to get close to him. Take him to your place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sylvia: Darling, what are you talking about? You want me to sleep with him? How could you say this to me!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My True Love: No, no, Babe. I love you. Why would I want you to sleep with another man? I’ll be giving you a pill. You seduce him a little, then put the pill in his drink. You just have to make him drink the drugged drink.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sylvia: I can’t do that. He’s very clever, and he’s got bodyguards too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My True Love: My precious, you’re so beautiful, and so sexy. Which man would dislike you? You just need to tempt him a little and you’ll succeed. He has a weakness, and that’s his promiscuity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sylvia: Tell me why, or I won’t do it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My True Love: All right, I’ll tell you. He’s got some stuff from our lab on him, and those things had been stolen by him. I am responsible for this, and if I don’t get those things back I’ll be killed. Please, I’m begging you. Help me, my precious. Are you going to watch me die?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sylvia: What did he steal?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My True Love: Babe, please believe me. I can’t tell you right now, but I will tell you when I have those things. We can go to Greece after it’s all over and have a nice relaxing time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sylvia: Okay, I’ll help you.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My True Love: He’ll fall unconscious soon after he drinks the drug. Send me a message right away, and someone will come in to take him away. You don’t have to do anything afterwards. Go out for a drink, and if someone asks where he went, you say that you don’t know. You were drinking in a bar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sylvia: Got it. That’s all, then. Wait for my good news, my Darling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their messages ended there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei then understood the situation. This Sylvia was not an agent from the CIA or from the FA Organisation. She was a woman who was being used, and the man who was using her, ‘My True Love’, was not from the CIA or the FA either — he was from the AE Research Center!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘My True Love’ had not stated explicitly that he was from the AE Research Center, but he had mentioned a ‘lab’, and that he was ‘responsible’. The thing he had asked Sylvia to do also added to Xia Lei’s suspicions, and proved that he was one of the people of the AE Research Center.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So the research centre had made its move now, and with such an unexpected method too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Getting a normal woman to do the job, and a sexy siren on top of that… If Xia Lei had not spotted Sylvia taking something from her bra, he would probably be drugged and unconscious right now. Truthfully, he had only become suspicious and wary after discovering that she had put something in his drink. He had not linked her to the CIA or the FA before that, much less the AE Research Center.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Xia Lei have new insight into the AE Research Center — it could be even more cunning than the CIA and the FA, and more treacherous too!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zzz zz zzt…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another message.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My True Love: What’s going on, Babe?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei thought for a bit, then typed out a message and sent it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No need to be anxious, Darling. He’s still taking a shower. I have the alcohol prepared. I’ll get him to drink it after he comes out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My True Love: Okay, Babe. Don’t let him take advantage of you, or I’ll be jealous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei didn’t type another response. He took Sylvia’s phone with him and left the room to go quickly to the shower. He turned on the shower, and then went into Sylvia’s study.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had managed to get some extra time for himself, but he needed to get what he wanted in this amount of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The passcode of the safe was no obstacle to Xia Lei. He quickly solved it with the power of his left eye and his hands, and opened the safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many drawings in the safe, and a document folder as well as almost 10,000 euros in cash. Sylvia’s passport was also in the safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei took out the drawings and put them on the desk. It was a thick stack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These drawings made Xia Lei’s eyes light up. These were all drawings of several of Rheinmetall’s artillery and armoured vehicles, as well as their specifications and parameters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t strange for Sylvia to have these important documents at her place. She was the Chief Machinist of Rheinmetall AG after all, and was in charge of the precision-processing workshop. Artillery, armoured vehicles, and all the parts which needed precision processing had to go through her hands first. Because she had to process these parts, she needed a deep understanding of the product, from where it would be used to what its final form would be like. This was why she had these drawings in her safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s left eye swept quickly over the drawings, one by one. His eye was like a camera, and every detail was absorbed. He was fast too, and quicker than a well-trained agent taking pictures with a camera.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei took a full ten minutes to finish looking at all the drawings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Next, he opened the document folder. There was a stack of drawings in it too, but it was not of artillery or armoured vehicles — it was the latest anti-ship missile defence system.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rheinmetall AG’s defence systems were known worldwide too, and this part of their operations accounted for 40% of their overall profit margins. The drawings’ excellence and importance was apparent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s left eye swiftly ‘captured’ each and every piece of drawing paper, and he could not help the smile which appeared in the corners of his mouth. Sylvia’s safe was like a guarantee to him. If Thunder Horse Military Factory produced automatic missiles, armoured cars and tanks in the future, as well as anti-ship missile defence systems or something, then it would be thanks to Sylvia.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ‘My True Love’ from the AE Research Center had used Sylvia to seduce him and try to capture him, but he had managed to get an advantage out of this, and what he wanted. These drawings would give wings to Thunder Horse Military Factory, and allow it to soar!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The way Xia Lei did things, he was not going to just use the technologies he had stolen as they were. He would do his own research too, and design his own, then make a better, improved version to release to the market!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei put back the items he had taken out to their original positions after he finished looking at them. Finally, he shut the door of the safe, and left the study.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sylvia was still lying on the sofa, unconscious. Her body was still as tempting as ever.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks, Miss Sylvia,” said Xia Lei softly. He walked to the door.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Footsteps suddenly came from beyond the door, soft, but quick.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei awakened the power of his left eye, and instantly saw the situation in the corridor outside. Four gunmen, two on each side, and approaching Sylvia’s flat. Their backs were to the wall, and they moved cautiously. A door to the left behind them was open, and a door to the right was open too. It was obvious that these four had been hiding in the two flats on the sides of Sylvia’s flat on the same floor all along, just waiting for her to send the signal. They would be able to enter her flat swiftly then, and take Xia Lei away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zzz zz zzt…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Blackberry phone buzzed again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei peeked at the screen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My True Love: Babe, you done?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei quickly typed: He’s drinking that beer now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hit ‘send’, and rushed to the balcony of the living room. He leapt when he got to the balcony, and jumped straight down from the third floor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei landed on both feet, and rolled to disperse the force of the impact.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tail-lights of a car parked by the side of the road lit up all of a sudden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened?” Tang Yuyan stuck her head out of the car.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei said nothing. He flipped to his feet, and made a dash to the car. He closed the door lightning-quick as soon as he entered the car, and said, “Go!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The driver got into the car at almost the same time, and started the engine. They left. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei looked through the one-way glass of the car’s window, at the balcony of Sylvia’s third-floor flat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gunman appeared on the balcony. Unfortunately for him, all he saw were cars coming and going on the street.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened?” said Long Bing anxiously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei let out a long sigh. “There’s CIA in that building. They want to capture me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh?” Long Bing stared blankly. There was nothing they could do about it. This was not China, and she and Tang Yuyan were not able to get the information they needed easily. Their movements were limited too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Yuyan quirked one corner of her mouth in a smile. “Learnt your lesson now, Pervert? It’s your own fault for nearly losing your life for a bit of tail.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei laughed. “I don’t regret it. I gained a lot from this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Yuyan frowned and put on an exaggerated expression. “Of course you gained a lot. I heard that German slut say you removed her hair. Yeah, and you broke her skin too. Argh, just the thought of it disgusts me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was speechless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that Sylvia one of the CIA?” said Long Bing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No. This is related to her boyfriend.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The conversation went back and forth between the three while the estate car headed towards Rheinmetall AG. This was a return from a rewarding journey.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For ‘My True Love’, however, he had gone for wool but come home shorn.&nbsp;</span></p>
