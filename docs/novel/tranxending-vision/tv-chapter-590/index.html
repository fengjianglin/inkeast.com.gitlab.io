 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Thunder Dragon intelligent lathe's core precision parts were the pure titanium parts he had processed in the competition with Sylvia. Its precision required 0.001 microns. So far, it was still impossible to achieve such precision. Only Xia Lei was capable of such a feat in the entire world. This super precise part was currently on a small intelligent lathe which was located on the Gust assault rifle production line. Xia Lei had made it smaller.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without this super-precision core part, the 500 ton Thunder Dragon lathe would become a pile of useless metal. However, Xia Lei did not just give up. He did some "minor" changes in all of the control programs which he had designed...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei came out of the Thunder Dragon workshop half an hour later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sylvia, you're done already?" asked a guard with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's actually nothing. It was just a simple job," Xia Lei replied. His voice had turned into a soft and enchanting woman's voice once again. The electronic device hidden in his mouth was a Chinese-made spy warfare product which could help him change his voice. It was very advance, and quite useful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do we still have a deal?" Another guard smirked. His eyes moved to Xia Lei's chest. The silica gel-filled area was extraordinarily seductive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei rolled his eyes at the guard. He said nothing, and walked away while swaying his hips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What does she mean? She coming with us to drink?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Are you dumb? Her eyes just said what she meant. Haha, she's a whore. Don't worry, the three of us will have a great night tonight." The other guard had a very wicked smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei drove Sylvia's car out of Rheinmetall AG while the two guards were imagining weird things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The street lights were dim and yellow, and Xia Lei glanced back at Rheinmetall AG through the rearview mirror. It slowly shrank in the mirror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rheinmetall AG was Thunder Horse Military Factory's competitor, but this competitor will be left behind in the near future because the entire Rheinmetall AG had been fitted into his brain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei withdrew his gaze and a smile appeared at the corners of his mouth...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half an hour later, Xia Lei reappeared in Sylvia's room. Sylvia was still unconscious, and she was unaware that Xia Lei was right in front of her. She had no clue about what had happened. She also didn't know what sort of change would happen to her life because of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei looked quietly at Sylvia lying on the bed. His was conflicted. He had used Sylvia's identity to enter Rheinmetall AG, and destroyed the Thunder Dragon intelligent lathe. It was the core existence for the production of the XL2500 sniper rifle and the Gust assault rifle. Destroying the Thunder Dragon intelligent lathe would be equivalent to cutting off Rheinmetall AG’s ability to produce the XL2500 sniper rifle and Gust assault rifle. This would be unacceptable to the German government, and she could face serious charges.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sorry, I don't have any other choice. I definitely wouldn't do this if I had a choice. You said that you wanted to work at my company before, so I promise you right now, that Thunder Horse Military Factory's doors will always be open to you. You are welcome at anytime. What you've lost in Germany, I will make it all up to you," Xia Lei said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no reaction from Sylvia. She could not hear Xia Lei's voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei lifted the blanket and Sylvia's body was exposed to his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei stared blankly Sylvia's slender body for a bit, then took off all of his clothing to swap with Sylvia. Lastly, he put on his own clothing and put a blanket over Sylvia before walking into her study.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei looked around the study, then took "The Song of Ice and Fire" from the bookshelf. Sylvia had put a bookmark in it. He took out the bookmark and wrote on it: Sylvia, if you run into trouble, come find me. I will take care of you. You should know how to contact me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei put the bookmark back in the pages of "The Song of Ice and Fire" after writing that note.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He left the study and glanced at Sylvia as he went past her room, then turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The door of an old station wagon opened downstairs, under the flat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei climbed into the car. The old station wagon started up immediately and sped away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"All done?" asked Long Bing, who was driving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei nodded. "All done. This thing…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't worry, I won't report it to the higher ups," said Long Bing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Yuyan, who was sitting with Xia Lei in the backseat, said, "I won't report you but you owe me this favor. How do you plan on repaying me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Destroying Rheinmetall AG's Thunder Dragon intelligent lathe, and making it so that Rheinmetall AG's XL2500 sniper rifle and Gust assault rifle's production lines were unable to produce anything protected Thunder Horse Group's interests, it wasn't completely in the nature of retaliation. But this situation was just too serious, and there would inevitably be voices of disagreement if the higher ups were to know, even if Xia Lei did everything perfectly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What about Annina?" Long Bing suddenly thought of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was silent for a moment. "She’s already made her decision. She wants to stay in Germany. What happened these last few days have nothing to do with her. She has worked at the Thunder Horse Military Factory for a long time, so the Germans will ask for her help. I don't think she will have any troubles."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing said, "It's great if there are no problems. We are heading to the sea now to leave by boat. Boss Shi has arranged everything.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the backseat, Tang Yuyan bumped Xia Lei's thigh with her knee. She whispered, "Xia Lei, I have a question for you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What question?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You pointed a gun at your own head in Mark Armin's house, to threaten that director of the CIA. You gave him 30 seconds. Would you have shot yourself and committed suicide if he didn't release me and Long Bing?" Tang Yuyan looked at Xia Lei, her eyes full of anticipation and some feelings which even she was unsure of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei smiled wryly. "Why do you ask? Did you think I wanted to point a gun at my own head? I didn't have a choice."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Yuyan bumped Xia Lei's waist with her elbow. "Just say if you would have done it or not."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei thought for a bit and said, "Probably not. We're not that close with each other, so why would I use blow off my own head with a gun for you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You!" Tang Yuyan suddenly smacked Xia Lei's knee with a fist and said angrily, "Then if I wasn’t there and only Long Bing was there, would you shoot?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't get me involved!" said Long Bing in discontent, before Xia Lei could answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I was only asking. What are you so nervous about?" Tang Yuyan retorted. She nudged Xia Lei in the waist again. "Come on, say it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei stammered, "I... this…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Would he have fired? Even he hadn't thought of this question before, so how could he give an answer?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then let me ask in a different way. If a head of the CIA told you to choose between me and Long Bing, and he would release whoever you choose, would you choose me or Long Bing?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This question was even more difficult to answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It would be wrong no matter who he chose, and payback for this mistake would take effect immediately. Tang Yuyan was sitting right beside him, and she would definitely punch him if he were to truthfully say that he'd choose Long Bing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing said, "Yuyan, we are all comrades. Do you think it's fitting for you to ask Xia Lei such a question? If that director of the CIA really did tell Xia Lei to choose, I would let Xia Lei choose you. Are you happy now?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing was good at understanding others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Yuyan pouted.
