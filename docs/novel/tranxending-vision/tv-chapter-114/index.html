 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>

 <p><strong>My Shorts are Torn</strong></p>
 <p>Mu Jian-Feng left and Xia Xue went back to her campus. Long Bing cleared the empty dishes on the table, an apron tied around her waist. Xia Lei sat and mulled over what Mu Jian-Feng had said before he left.</p>
 <p>Mu Jian-Feng meant for him to go to Germany to observe and study the lathes.</p>
 <p>Germany’s manufacturing industry was not weaker than America’s - it was even better in some areas. There was also an advantage in going to Germany to examine the latest high-precision lathes, and it was safety. It would be much safer to go to Germany as Germany was not as guarded against China and had no opposing ideologies between them. Internet news reported cases of Chinese businessmen being caught stealing American classified information by the Americans from time to time but reports like this were rare from Germany. That was why Germany was the best choice.</p>
 <p>Long Bing cleared the cutlery and walked over to sit opposite Xia Lei. She looked at him, “You’ll be going to Germany soon. What do you know about Germany?”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei thought for a bit, “Um, the German industries are highly developed and it has a high position in the European Union. Their beer is famous too… Oh, right, and Bayern Munich Football Club.”</p>
 <p>“You like football?”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei shook his head, “I can’t say that I like it, it’s just so famous that I know of it. This is all I know about Germany.”</p>
 <p>“It’s all right. You can speak German and that’s enough,” said Long Bing, “I will be in charge of your safety for this mission but I don’t understand German. You’ll have to take care of me over there.”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei had known about Long Bing accompanying him to Germany when he’d had the talk with Mu Jian-Feng and he liked the arrangement very much. He smiled, “No problem. I won’t translate the male toilet as the female toilet.”</p>
 <p>His joke was met by Long Bing’s non-smiling face. “So when will you depart?” she said.</p>
 <p>“Well, two days was what was said but I may need more time. I don’t think we’ll need to hurry though. I’d like to settle some things I need to get done so I can go off with no worries.” At that, he suddenly remembered the reason he had come to Jing-Du and said, “Oh, right. Did you find out what those parts Chi Jing-Qiu wants me to process are for?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
 <p>“You don’t know?” Xia Lei looked at Long Bing in surprise.</p>
 <p>“I’ve asked several experts and professors from different fields but all of them could not tell me the purpose of these parts. I can’t help you do anything in this situation. What do you plan to do?” said Long Bing.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei considered before he spoke, “This is very strange. I may fall into someone’s trap if I’m not careful. I’m not going to do this job. So what if I earn less.”</p>
 <p>“It’s better to avoid unnecessary trouble. That’s the right way to think. That’s that, then. Have an early night. I’ll accompany you to Hai-Zhu City tomorrow and wait for you to finished settling your matters before we depart for Germany,” said Long Bing.</p>
 <p>“Mm, I’ll go to my room.” Xia Lei got up and went to the second floor.</p>
 <p>An almost indiscernible smile appeared in the corners of Long Bing’s mouth…</p>
 <p>Xia Lei’s thoughts were still preoccupied by Chi Jing-Qiu and her purchase order when he got back to the room. He’d thought that Long Bing would be able to help him find out what those parts were for but even ‘Long Bing of Great Ability’ could not do it. This was surprising to Xia Lei.</p>
 <p>‘It’s not a frame-up if it’s not for military purposes but why would Chi Jing-Qiu go meet Gu Ke Wen? If those parts are Gu Ke-Wen’s then why would she give me the purchase order? Impossible…’ Xia Lei’s head was full of confusion.</p>
 <p>Music came from outside his room, and it was exercise music with a strong bass just like yesterday.</p>
 <p>The music brought back some memories for Xia Lei and the image of Long Bing in her exercise bikini - her wet skin, and those mature, seductive shapes wrapped in fabric…</p>
 <p>These memories threw him off his train of thought. He got out of bed and opened the door to go out, thinking, ‘Is she going to give me a lesson like she did yesterday? I fell for it once - will I fall for it again?’</p>
 <p>Xia Lei spotted Long Bing on the exercise bike at once.</p>
 <p>It was similar to the situation last night. She was in an exercise bikini and the intense workout made her perspire more than she had last night. Her body was wet - her snow-white neck and chest were beaded with sweat and her waist and thighs glistened. She looked like she had just emerged from a sauna.</p>
 <p>Her hands grasped the handlebars as she leaned forward, her bum up as she pedalled furiously. Against the seat cover, that fabric-covered shape was outlined clearly, sultry and alluring. What made Xia Lei’s nose want to bleed even more was that that mature shape would press against the seat once in a while, putting a gentle pressure on the shape and changing it. Every little change brought a strong wave of stimulation to Xia Lei, who felt like he was a man thirsting for water after not having any for three days.</p>
 <p>However, Xia Lei had learnt from his mistake. He quietly observed Long Bing’s body and saw that she had no towel and hence no gun hidden in it.</p>
 <p>‘Maybe this isn’t a lesson’ thought Xia Lei. His eyes moved to Long Bing’s breasts. The intense workout made them jiggle in an amazing way. Xia Lei was dazzled by the beautiful scene below her collarbone.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Long Bing suddenly reached under the exercise bike for a small gun and aimed it at Xia Lei in one swift motion.</p>
 <p>The aiming only took a third of a second but Xia Lei was on guard and had already dived for the floor.</p>
 <p>Bang! A rubber bullet almost grazed Xia Lei’s scalp as it flew past.</p>
 <p>Having missed, Long Bing adjusted her aim.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei rolled away and into his room just in time.</p>
 <p>Bang! Another rubber bullet grazed his shoulder and struck the floor, bouncing off in another direction.</p>
 <p>The gun was very small and held just two bullets. Long Bing looked faintly satisfied at missing. She got off the exercise bike and walked towards the door, saying, “Not bad. You pass for alertness and reaction.”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei cautiously poked his head out from the doorway and laughed bitterly, “Can we not do this?”</p>
 <p>Long Bing stopped in the doorway, “The lessons will end when I cannot predict what you’ll do.”</p>
 <p>“I’m just a consultant. There’s no need to train me like a contractor or a spy, is there?”</p>
 <p>“Germany may be safer than America but there are still unknown variables. We’ll be in great danger if what we’re about to do is discovered. Learn well if you want to come back safely.”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei laughed, “Okay, I’ll learn everything you want to teach me.”</p>
 <p>“We’ll stop here for tonight. You can use the shower on the second floor. I’ll use the shower on the first floor. Good night.” Long Bing turned and headed downstairs.</p>
 <p>“Good night.” Xia Lei’s gaze went to her bum and a myriad of images crowded his mind.</p>
 <p>After a while, Xia Lei changed into his pyjamas and put on slippers to go for a shower before sleeping. He turned on the shower and took his pyjamas off. As he was about to remove his briefs, he suddenly stopped. His left eye had caught a small change in the visible light from under the bathroom door. The change was very small but his eye was sharp and caught even the slightest of changes in light.</p>
 <p>This tiny change in light made him go into high alert. His left eye twitched and the frosted glass door disappeared from his sight.</p>
 <p>Beyond the door was Long Bing, approaching carefully with a silenced gun. One hand was reaching slowly for the handle, her ears turned towards the shower, listening closely for sounds inside.</p>
 <p>Again? Why didn’t she give up?!</p>
 <p>Xia Lei had an idea and he took the pyjamas from the hanger and hung it on the showerhead, then pulled the plastic shower curtain closed. The water hit the pyjamas, making a peculiar sound. The plastic curtain was a little translucent so it looked like a person was inside taking a shower.</p>
 <p>His camouflage done, Xia Lei snuck quietly behind the door.</p>
 <p>Just as he hid himself, Long Bing pulled the bathroom door open with her arm raised and gun pointed. She fired three shots at the shower curtain.</p>
 <p>Three rubber bullets pierced through the shower curtain and hit the pyjamas under the showerhead.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei suddenly sprang out and tackled Long Bing to the ground by her waist. Long Bing scrambled to raise her gun when she realised she’d been tricked but Xia Lei had anticipated that move and seized her wrist before she could point her gun, pressing her beneath his own body.</p>
 <p>A man and a woman on the floor in a bathroom, the man in just his briefs and the woman in an exercise bikini. Their bodies were practically naked against each other, even the most sensitive areas separated by just some thin layers of cloth with everything outlined clearly.</p>
 <p>Long Bing suddenly raised her leg and used her knee to knee Xia Lei in the side but he raised his leg too and pressed his thigh against hers, blocking her attack. He did block her attack but it resulted in his thing against her thing. It was like an electric current had gone through the both of them in that instant and they went still.</p>
 <p>Long Bing’s face turned red. Seemed like she’d felt the change in Xia Lei’s body. She tried to move the leg that was pinned by Xia Lei and get out of his hold but her attempt did not shake him loose. Instead, it made unexpected rubbing and pressure… She was at a loss for words as, in under ten seconds, Xia Lei’s face turned red and his breathing heavy. His reaction was at maximum obviousness.</p>
 <p>Struggling and countering had brought her these results. Long Bing wanted to hit her head against a wall. She gave up on moving. “All right, today’s lesson is over. Get off.”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei, however, did not move. “You said that today’s lesson was over earlier but you still came into the bathroom to ambush me. I don’t believe you.”</p>
 <p>“An assassin will always choose to attack you when you are vulnerable.”</p>
 <p>“Even more reason not to let you go unless you put the gun down and surrender.”</p>
 <p>“Your, that… My shorts are torn.” Long Bing looked very embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Huh?” Xia Lei quickly got up to see what had happened.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Xia Lei screamed…</p>
 <p>The exercise bikini shorts were fine. They were just wet from perspiration.</p>
