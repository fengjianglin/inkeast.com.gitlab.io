 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, you can’t. Not there.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you still shy about it?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, it’s just… Hnnh. Be more gentle. I’m bleeding.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t move about. It’s more difficult for me if you wiggle about.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Take it out! Take it out!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing sat on a chair in a roadside motel. Xia Lei was crouching at her feet, using tweezers to pull the splinters out cautiously. Long Bing’s voice filled him with certain thoughts, and he couldn’t help smiling wryly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The television in the room had been playing a variety show, but it abruptly switched to an urgent news report. Mount Fuji appeared on the screen, in the background of Oshino Hakkao, and the reporter. Behind the reporter were several corpses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the late hours of the evening last night, a fierce gunfight broke out in Oshino Hakkai. Several corpses were found in Oshino Hakkai, and in the mountain forest, and the body count has reached 38. This is the most bloody incident to have happened after World War Two. According to the police’s initial investigations, a fraction of the bodies are of the local Yakuza, and there are also some corpses which seem to belong to some unknown military group. The situation is still being under investigation by the police, and we shall continue observing, to bring you the lastest updates…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This news report caught Xia Lei and Long Bing’s attention, and both their gazes went to the screen, to look at what the camera captured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reporter entered Heart of Oshino, and came to the room where the gunfight had taken place. The camera panned the room – it was full of gouges in the wood, and there were blood stains. However, there was no Gu Kewen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reporter stood in the doorway and said, “According to eyewitnesses, the fiercest battle happened in this room. A woman had died in this room, but her body is now missing…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei wrinkled his brows. “Did Dark Mona take Gu Kewen’s body?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing thought about the situation back then. “It should have been Dark Mona. We just don’t know why she would take Gu Kewen’s corpse.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hm. Could Gu Kewen still be alive?” Xia Lei had a mild suspicion, because Dark Mona would not take Gu Kewen’s body under normal circumstances. There was no advantage for her to do so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Impossible. I stabbed her heart with my knife. She can’t still be alive. If it wasn’t for Dark Mona pointing a gun at me, I would have stabbed her twice,” said Long Bing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei gave a laugh. “Is there a difference between you stabbing her once and stabbing her twice? I trust your capabilities. Gu Kewen must be dead. It looks like it could be for another reason. Never mind, she’s already dead so we don’t have to bother about this. Let’s continue.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing grabbed Xia Lei’s hand and stared straight at him. “What is the identity of the woman called Dark Mona? Why does she want to kill you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was silent. He was torn. He knew that Long Bing would ask him this sooner or later, and he needed to give her an explanation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is it not convenient to tell me?” As an elite agent of Bureau 101, there was no way Long Bing would not have any suspicions, especially after what happened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei spoke. “She is part of the FA Organisation.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“FA Organisation?” Long Bing frowned. “I’ve heard of them. It’s an international group of free agents and very mysterious. That Dark Mona is one of them? What is her goal?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei laughed dryly. “Me.” After a pause, he continued, “I actually made some discoveries in my research as the person in charge of the Alloy X Project. I am the only person who can interact with the alloy. It is a very unique alloy, and it stores a type of mysterious, very strong power. I am still unable to unravel the last bit of its mysteries but I believe that it will shake the world when this mystery is solved.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was all Xia Lei could tell Long Bing, and the closest to the truth. There was no way he could tell Long Bing that he had taken AE capsules, and that his father, Xia Changhe, was an agent of the FA Organisation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not all of the truth, but Long Bing understood something. Xia Lei was the only one who could interact with that ancient alloy, so he was the only one who could go to the treasure locations and study it. She did not find it strange that the CIA and the FA Organisation would want to capture Xia Lei alive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I remember you telling this before. You said that you could interact with the alloy, maybe because you had fixed the compass. It looks like what you said has some grounding now.” Long Bing sighed. “And now that I think about it, I was the one who asked you to fix the compass. This is like fate, and it’s like we were meant to experience all of these.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei felt a little guilty. He did not speak, but just made a soft grunt of agreement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Never mind. Let’s talk about these things later. It’s my turn to clean your wounds now.” Long Bing stared hotly at Xia Lei. “Take off your trousers.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was speechless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few minutes later, the wounded and the wound-tender were intertwined. He was in her and she was in him, and there was no telling where he and she ended and where they begun. The wounds on their body did not affect their passions, and the pain and the pleasure melded together, making them drunk on its taste. There was no resisting it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, in Oshino Hakkai, in a modified camper car.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao watched a video some tourist had recorded of the battle. Her eyes seemed a little vacant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An Asian youth was in the video, his gun raised and his movements fluid, clean. She had never seen this young Asian man before but she had a feeling that this was the young man she had loved deeply in the past. She still could not forget Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This conclusion was not just through gut instinct. She had her evidence, and that was the XL2500 sniper rifle in the young man’s hands, and the shape of his body. His gaze was exactly like Xia Lei’s too. She knew everything about him, and all these characteristics were enough for her to determine that the young man in the video was Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The woman by his side should be Long Bing, eh? Her body matches hers perfectly.” The corners of Liang Siyao’s mouth quirked up in a smile and sourness tinged her words. “What’s so good about her? She’s so cold and aloof, and is not feminine at all. You weren’t willing to forgive me but you’re with her? Do you want to be like James Bond? A beautiful female companion on every mission. You skirt-chaser. Humph!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The video was very shaky and it did not capture Dark Mona or Gu Kewen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao hesitated after she was done watching it, then&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">deleted</span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;it. </span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A CIA agent got into the car and said in a low voice, “Chief, did you find anything?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nothing. The video was too shaky. No need to bother about this. I’ll handle it,” said Liang Siyao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, Chief. We also got information that a Yakuza group in Hokkaido was destroyed. They were smugglers. Their people discovered their boat in the sea, and the men who had been killed. Could this be connected to what happened here?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you trying to say?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m just speculating, Chief.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao’s voice was cold. “Do we need to handle that sort of case too? Smuggling and the Yakuza is the business of the Japanese police, not ours. Remember that our target is that person. Get out of the car. Go collect more information from China.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, Chief. I’ll get to work.” The agent who had spoken to Liang Siyao was not entirely happy, but he did not dare to argue with Liang Siyao. He exited the camper-turned-command-centre.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao took out a satellite phone and called a number after that agent had left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The call connected, and Liang Siyao spoke quietly. “Uncle, your precious son has come. Haven’t you seen the news? He’s going overboard these days. Aren’t you going to do something as a father? He would be in a lot of danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Changhe’s voice came from over the line. “My son is all grown up and he doesn’t listen to me anymore.

He’s already married to Shentu Tianyin. That skirt-chaser. We broke up, and I did not date anyone but he went and got married. I’d like to punch him!”&nbsp;</span></p>
