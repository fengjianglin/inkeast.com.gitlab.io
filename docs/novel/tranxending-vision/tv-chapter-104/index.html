 <p><strong>Kamsutram Oil</strong></p>
 <p>When they got to the table, Ren Wen-Qiang got up from his seat with a pleasant smile on his face, “Hello, Mr Xia. I saw that you had nobody you’re familiar with at that table so I asked Ning Jing to invite you over. Let’s sit together.”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei also put a smile on his face, “I’ll be intruding then, thank you.”</p>
 <p>Xu Lang also stood up and reached out a hand to shake with Xia Lei, “Long time no see, Mr Xia. Hello.”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei was polite too, “Hello, Mr Xu.”</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang pulled out a chair for Xia Lei and smiled as he said, “We’re all friends here, no need to be so formal. Come, sit, sit.” He looked at Ning Jing and said, “Ning Jing, you sit next to him.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Ning Jing looked rather happy that she didn’t have to sit next to Ren Wen-Qiang.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei and Ning Jing took their seats and other guests also came to the table but they did not know each other and so did not exchange greetings.</p>
 <p>After chatting about some trivial things, Ren Wen-Qiang shot Xu Lang a look.</p>
 <p>Xu Lang gave a slight nod and gave a barely perceivable evil smile.</p>
 <p>The pair’s tricks did not escape Xia Lei’s eye. His left eye twitched and the table disappeared, revealing the situation under it. He saw a bottle of red wine by Ren Wen-Qiang’s feet and the spiked bottle of wine by Xu Lang’s feet.</p>
 <p>“Mr Xia, I feel bad about what happened in the past. I do apologise,” said Ren Wen-Qiang.</p>
 <p>“No need to mind it, Mr Ren, it was just a small matter. You don’t have to take it to heart,” said Xia Lei. As he spoke, he reached to take his phone out but accidentally dropped it on the floor. “Excuse me,” he said, and squatted to pick it up.</p>
 <p>While squatting, Xia Lei switched the bottles of wine in a flash, then picked up his mobile phone and went back to his seat.</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang and Xu Lang could not lift the tablecloth to see what Xia Lei was doing under there in front of other guests as they had images to maintain. Furthermore, they would never in a million years imagine that Xia Lei had seen through their scheme and switched the bottle of spiked wine for the clean one.</p>
 <p>The mobile phone cover had some scratches on it and Xia Lei pretended to be upset, sighing and grumbling, “How unlucky.”</p>
 <p>“Mr Xia, I hear you are the Chairman of a company now. It’s just a mobile phone and a locally produced Xiaomi at that,” Xu Lang said in a faintly mocking way.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei laughed uncomfortably, “Ah, please excuse my poor phone.”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei looked like he was simple-minded and honest, not getting upset at Xu Lang’s snide words. The other guests at the table also looked down on Xia Lei and their gazes were full of contempt. What company was this young punk chairman of? An empty shell company, or a small little workshop claiming to be a company?</p>
 <p>Ning Jing was displeased and said, “So what if it’s a locally produced phone? Are all Apple iPhone users definitely rich or high class?”</p>
 <p>Ning Jing was the most honest of all but it was a mystery why she was standing up for Xia Lei at this point of time and coming to his aid when he was suffering an injustice.</p>
 <p>A flash of displeasure showed in Xu Lang’s eyes but he did not act out.</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang laughed, “Let’s not talk about mobile phones now. Mr Xia, I am very sorry for what happened last time. I was looking for a chance to apologise to you but couldn’t so today, I must give you a toast as a token of my apology.” So saying, he bent to retrieve a bottle of red wine.</p>
 <p>The apology was just an excuse to have him drink.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei laughed, “You’re being too courteous, Mr Ren. That matter is past and you don’t have to apologise to me.”</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang popped the oak cork and stood to pour wine into the long-stemmed glass in front of Xia Lei, saying, “I insist. If you don’t drink, it’ll mean that you haven’t forgiven me and don’t see me as a friend.”</p>
 <p>Since he put it that way, Xia Lei would be seen as impolite if he did not drink.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei stood, took up the glass and drank it all, then said, “Give me the wine. I’ll pour you some too. Let’s have a toast.”</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang gave Xu Lang a look and poured more wine for Xia Lei as he said, “It’s all right, I can pour my own.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Xu Lang stood with a bottle of wine in his hands, acting natural. He laughed as he said, “How about we not be so formal? I’ll pour some wine for you, Brother Ren, and us three shall have a drink together.” He popped the oak cork on the wine bottle and poured a glass for Ren Wen-Qiang, then one for himself.</p>
 <p>If one poured for another, he must also pour one for himself - this was the most basic of rules.</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang and Xu Lang raised their glasses to clink them with Xia Lei’s glass.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei shook his head gently, “Strange, is the alcohol content of this wine very high? I drank just one glass but I feel dizzy already.”</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang and Xu Lang exchanged glances and faint evil smiles appeared on their lips.</p>
 <p>“Don’t fool us, Mr Xia. It’s just one glass. I’ll toast first.” Ren Wen-Qiang clinked his glass with Xia Lei’s, then tipped his head back and drank half the wine in his glass.</p>
 <p>Xu Lang also clinked his glass with Xia Lei’s and drank the red wine in his glass.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei could not refuse. He bit the bullet and drank a second glass of wine.</p>
 <p>“I’ll pour for you.” Xia Lei reached to take the bottle of wine in Ren Wen-Qiang’s hand.</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang wouldn’t hand the bottle to Xia Lei, of course. He poured a third glass for Xia Lei, “Mr Xia, I was the one who asked Ning Jing to invite you over here. I should be the one pouring.”</p>
 <p>Xu Lang went with his act, using the other bottle of wine to pour a glass for Ren Wen-Qiang and himself.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei smiled, “All right. Let’s toast and we’ll all be friends after this.”</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang and Xu Lang looked at each other and smiled, then drank their second glass of wine with Xia Lei.</p>
 <p>The people sharing the table looked at the three young men in disapproval, thinking them rude and ignorant of the rules. They showed a lack of social etiquette to be drinking when the banquet had not yet begun. However, these were all dignified people with their statuses and they did not express the displeasure they felt.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chi Jing-Qiu walked over. She looked first at Xia Lei, then said to Ren Wen-Qiang, “Mr Ren, you are the person in charge of Vientaine Group’s wind power project. Our Chairman Ning would like you to come onstage to say a few words.”</p>
 <p>“Of course.” Ren Wen-Qiang stood. He staggered a little and Chi Jing-Qiu hurriedly reached to support him.</p>
 <p>“Are you all right, Mr Ren?” asked Chi Jing-Qiu, concerned.</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang shook his head, “I’m all right. Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang followed Chi Jing-Qiu towards the stage.</p>
 <p>At the table, Xu Lang shook his head too, looking confused. He started to turn red and his eyes were bloodshot. All these seemed to be the effects of the drug working on him.</p>
 <p>A smile appeared on Xia Lei’s face. All he had to do now was to sit back quietly to watch the show.</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang walked to the stage, cheeks as red as if he had applied rouge. His eyes were bloodshot and dull and he did not look like he was behaving normally.</p>
 <p>Chi Jing-Qiu stood next to him and said quietly, “What is wrong, Mr Ren? Did you drink a lot of alcohol? Will you be able to do it?”</p>
 <p>Important individuals such as Ning Yuan-Shan, Shentu Tian-Yin, Hu Hou, Xu Zheng-Wen and others were seated at the table facing the stage. Ren Wen-Qiang’s strange behaviour had, of course, not escaped the eyes of these important people.</p>
 <p>“Mr Ren seems to have had one too many to drink,” said Ning Yuan-Shan, “The banquet hasn’t started yet. Why did he drink so much?”</p>
 <p>Ning Yuan-Shan was just speaking casually and had no ill-will nor intention of slander but it was like a jibe to Shentu Tian-Yin. Ren Wen-Qiang was someone she had a high opinion of and entrusted an important task to, so him acting in such a disrespectful manner was making her look bad.</p>
 <p>Xu Zheng-Wen hurriedly ran interference and laughed as he said, “That child Wen-Qiang is sitting with Xu Lang. It’s nothing big for two young men to drink a little.”</p>
 <p>Just then, Ren Wen-Qiang gasped into the microphone on the stage, his breathing coming in heavy, quick bursts. He also looked excited and very strange.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong, Mr Ren?” Chi Jing-Qiu looked worried.</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang looked at Chi Jing-Qiu, a sudden sinister grin splitting his originally calm face, “Pretty girl.”</p>
 <p>Chi Jing-Qiu froze. “Mr Ren?”</p>
 <p>Ren Wen-Qiang suddenly wrapped his arms around Chi Jing-Qiu, pushing her to the floor of the stage. His hands grabbed at Chi Jing-Qiu clothes madly, tearing them apart quickly and exposing her purple bra. He opened his mouth wide and took a bite…</p>
 <p>It was as if a Siberian wind had blown through the great hall. Everyone was frozen in shock.</p>
 <p>“Aah! Help!” screamed Chi Jing-Qiu as she held Ren Wen-Qiang’s head away with both her hands, lest he peck at her sensitive place.</p>
 <p>Some security personnel came to their senses then and rushed onstage to pull Ren Wen-Qiang off Chi Jing-Qiu. Ren Wen-Qiang was like a wild animal, kicking and biting the security personnel. It took the combined efforts of the security team to put him under control.</p>
 <p>Chi Jing-Qiu got up from the stage floor, clutching her pale breasts. Faced with the gazes of an entire hall of guests, she suddenly let out a scream and ran towards the back of the stage in tears.</p>
 <p>Just when everyone thought it was over, Xu Lang suddenly snatched up the female guest beside him in an embrace and the two of them fell to the floor. Xu Lang behaved exactly like Ren Wen-Qiang had. He tore the female guest’s clothing and nibbled at her face, neck and breasts. He was worse than a beast in that moment.</p>
 <p>“You bastard!” The female guest’s husband was furious. He grabbed a chair and smashed it on Xu Lang’s back.</p>
 <p>The chair broke but Xu Lang did not cease his transgression. He reached his hand into the female guest’s skirt and ripped the cloth covering her, pulling it out from under her skirt.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei could not stand to watch any more of this. He stood and kicked Xu Lang in the waist, getting him off the female guest’s body.</p>
 <p>Xu Lang got to his feet and roared, and made to rush at the female guest again.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei quickly intercepted and blocked Xu Lang, grabbing his arm at the same time and, taking advantage of the momentum, pulled him downwards as he kicked at his foot, making Xu Lang drop to the floor. He twisted Xu Lang’s arm and used his knee to put pressure on Xu Lang’s spine, subduing him.</p>
 <p>The great hall was filled with the noise of voices.</p>
 <p>Ning Yuan-Shan strode over, his face full of anger, “What is going on? What is this!”</p>
