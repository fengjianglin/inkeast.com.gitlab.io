 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had completed the toasts in the groom’s guest area, so Xia Lei now accompanied Shentu Tianyin in the bride’s guest area. Shentu Tianyin guided him, and he first drank a toast to the Shentu clan. He recognised almost all of the Shentu clan, but he had no friendly sentiments towards these people. He did not like them, but he was polite on account of Shentu Ren and Shentu Tianyin. He greeted them one by one, and drank with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Shentu clan were quite conflicted about it too. They had tried to topple Shentu Tianyin from her position in the past, and chase her out of Vientaine Group. They’d seen Xia Lei as an enemy and tried to bully and pressure him in various ways. Now, however, they had to live their lives pandering to Xia Lei. They dared not show any dissatisfaction on their faces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Shentu clan started whispering as soon as Xia Lei and Shentu Tianyin walked away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are they so haughty about? It’s useless even if he has godly abilities — he can’t make his wife pregnant! What’s all that money he’s making for?” said one of Shentu Tianyin’s uncles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah! That punk Xia Lei and Tianyin signed the marriage papers months ago, but Tianyin’s stomach hasn’t changed one bit. Is that guy impotent?” said one of Shentu Tianyin’s male cousins.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heh heh. This is retribution. That Xia fellow made Second Uncle’s family go to prison, and didn’t even let the Grandfather off. Of course the Heavens are going to punish him for his evil-doings,” said one of Shentu Tianyin’s aunts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s good that she’s not pregnant. There won’t be a heir to take over Vientaine Group then, and it would still belong to the Shentu clan. This is a good thing. Let’s toast to that,” said one of Shentu Tianyin’s male cousins.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Shentu clan raised their glasses in celebration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the only balance they could find now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei could not hear what the Shentu clan was saying behind his back, but he would laugh if he could hear them. Only weaklings would mock those stronger than them behind their backs, and people like these were usually ignorant of their own circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was led Shentu Tianyin in toasts with the celebrities and established businessmen in attendance of their wedding. These people had said words of mockery earlier, but each and every one of them put a smile of flattery on their faces now, and were giving Xia Lei toasts, trying to win his favour and get acquainted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The celebrities were trying to curry favour with Xia Lei because they were after the clout Shentu Tianyin had in the entertainment industry, and the businessmen were tried to get acquainted with Xia Lei for political and business clout he possessed. Xia Lei was happy to make the acquaintance of these business people on his end too, and increase his connections. This was advantageous to him too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were done toasting the important people on the bride’s side, and the wedding banquet was drawing to a close.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll help you to a place to rest. You’ve had one too many.” Shentu Tianyin held on to Xia Lei’s arm and spoke in concern.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei had indeed consumed a lot of alcohol. He had not kept exact count, but he had definitely consumed over half a kilogram. He was not one bit drunk however, as the mysterious power in his body had awakened when he had been drinking in the groom’s guest area, and cleared the alcohol from his system. He could drink one bottle of baijiu, or even ten, no problem. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin was unaware of this, however, and she was worried about Xia Lei. She had watched him drink cup after cup, after all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘She would surely think that it’s drunk-talk if I tell her that I’m not drunk, huh?’ thought Xia Lei. He acted drunk, and said slowly, “Nn… I’m not drunk.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re not drunk? You drank so much! I’ll help you to a place to rest,” said Shentu Tianyin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, yes… let’s go rest.” Xia Lei put a drunken stagger in his steps.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xia Bro!” came a voice all of a sudden. “Long time no see. It’s your big day today, so come here and have a drink with an old friend, eh?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This voice was a little familiar, and Xia Lei looked over to see who was talking to him. Xu Lang. He also spotted Ren Wenqiang sitting next to him. He would have forgotten all about the existence of these two if he had not seen them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come, come, come, Xia Bro. We’re all friends here. You have to have a toast with us. It’s your big day today after all.” Xu Lang picked up a bottle of Flying Maotai from the table, and a beverage glass. He poured as he walked over to Xia Lei. The cup was filled to the brim by the time he stood before Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei understood why this Xu Lang had called out to him in greeting. He wanted to make him completely drunk, and kick him when he was down by giving him a big cup of alcohol and see him make a drunken fool of himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Is this all that this old rival can do?’ Xia Lei sighed to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Lang walked up to Xia Lei and Shentu Tianyin with a smile on his face. “Xia Bro, bottoms-up, if you see me as a friend. I wish you and your wife a long life together, and to be soon blessed with children.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Xia Lei could speak, Shentu Tianyin frowned and said, “Mr Xu, my husband has had enough to drink. He cannot have more.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Would Xia Bro even wince at this amount of alcohol? Eh? Am I right, Xia Bro? Drink, drink.” Xu Lang shoved the beverage cup into Xia Lei’s hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei held the cup but did not drink. He looked at Xu Lang blearily. “You are…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hate flashed in Xu Lang’s eyes. He knew that Xia Lei knew who he was, and they had been love rivals too, over Jiang Ruyi. How could Xia Lei forget him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I remember now. You’re Xu Lang, aren’t you? What are you doing here?” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Drink, drink.” Xu Lang kept mum about his reason for attending, and tried to make Xia Lei drink instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ren Wenqiang walked over then. He, too, held a bottle of alcohol in his hand and a cup. There was a smile on his face as he said, “Your achievements to date makes one envious, Xia Bro. You can’t have forgotten me too, eh?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei gave a laugh. “Ren Wenqiang. Of course I remember.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good that you remember,” laughed Ren Wenqiang. “Let’s drink, us three.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin had been about to lose her temper at Xu Lang and Ren Wenqiang, but she did not say anything about it when she saw how Xia Lei was smiling as he talked with them. If they really were Xia Lei’s friends, and she lost her temper at them, then Xia Lei would be upset. She was still worried about Xia Lei’s health, though, and she nudged Xia Lei with an elbow. “If you really must drink, then let me drink on your behalf,” she said quietly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine, it’s fine,” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Lang laughed and said, “No need to worry, Ma’am. Xia Bro’s alcohol tolerance is really high. He won’t get drunk from this one cup.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ren Wenqiang spoke up too. “Yep, yep, he doesn’t need you to drink on his behalf.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Annoyance flashed in Shentu Tianyin’s eyes, but she did not lose her temper.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was not drunk yet. He looked at Xu Lang and Ren Wenqiang. “I asked you two what you’re doing here. Is this so hard to answer?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ren Wenqiang and Xu Lang exchanged looks. Their eyes held hate and embarrassment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sure I didn’t send you any invitations. I’m sure my wife won’t invite you either. How did you two get in?” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you mean by this, huh, Xia?” Xu Lang could not hold back the flames of his anger. “The two of you are just stinking rich. Don’t forget that you were just a construction worker back then in Haizhu!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ren Wenqiang also sneered, “I’ll tell you how I came here. I came here with our Director Wang. I wouldn’t come if you’d invited me! Let me tell you this, Xia Lei — don’t forget your beginnings. Think about your joke of a beginning in Haizhu, and don’t be so full of it. Have a good look at yourself.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some guests looked over, and they started whispering.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get out, the two of you!” said Shentu Tianyin angrily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Lang sneered. “Who do you think you are? Must I leave because you tell me to? What can you do about it if I refuse to leave, huh? Call the police and have me arrested?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the police, and he had held a position in Jingdu for some time, so he was secure in the knowledge that he had backing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin was about to summon her bodyguards when Xia Lei stopped her. “Let me handle this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Humph!” scoffed Xu Lang. “What are you going to do against me, Xia? Hit me if you dare. I’ll let you hit me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hit you?” Xia Lei shook his head. “I don’t want to dirty my hand.” He then waved a hand at the doorway.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four Bureau 101 agents walked over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please take these two people out,” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four Bureau 101 agents said not a word. Each pair had Xu Lang and Ren Wenqiang accosted in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They like to drink, and they’ve each brought a bottle, so let them drink,” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four Bureau 101 agents dragged Ren Wenqiang and Xu Lang out. Xu Lang struggled, and was hit viciously in his lower abdomen by an agent. He fell quiet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The agents were silent throughout the entire process, but they followed Xia Lei’s command to the letter. Xia Lei was a consultant in Bureau 101, but the prestige he had built up in the organisation was not any lower than Long Bing, Tang Yuyan and Tang Bochuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Zhengyi watched everything happen with his own eyes since he was at the same table as Xu Lang and Ren Wenqiang. Xu Lang had given him a pleading look as he had been taken away by the Bureau 10 agents, but Xu Zhengyi had responded with a shake of his head, and pretended not to see. Even he dared not mess with Xia Lei now, much less a pitiful little Xu Lang!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s all right now, it’s all right. Everyone, please eat well and drink well. Enjoy yourselves.” Xia Lei spouted some courtesies, and left with Shentu Tianyin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, in a toilet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You fucktards dared to cause trouble. You must have blubber for skin.” Long Bing’s subordinate put two bottles of baijiu on the toilet floor, and looked down at Xu Lang and Ren Wenqiang, who had been knocked to the ground. He sneered, “I’ll give you two choices. One, I pour it down your nostrils. Two, you drink it yourself.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Lang said angrily, “Who are you? What do you want? I’m a policema…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing’s subordinate kicked him before he finished his sentence. He grabbed Xu Lang’s hair when he doubled over. “I’ll say it one more time. Drink it yourself, or I pour it down your nostrils for you.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Xu Lang could make a move, Ren Wenqiang suddenly grabbed the bottle with less alcohol in it, and lifted it to his lips. Glub, glub, glub went the alcohol, down to his belly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Lang looked wordlessly at Ren Wenqiang, and he forced himself to pick up a bottle too. He suddenly thought of a person in that moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mommy…&nbsp;</span></p>
