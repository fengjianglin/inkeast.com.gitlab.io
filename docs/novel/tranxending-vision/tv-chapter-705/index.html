 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no body in the stone sarcophagus. A piece of paper sat on red cloth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a line of Italian written on the paper: How did barbarians go down to hell?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was flabbergasted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this a joke that da Vinci was playing on him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had gone through all that danger and made his way here with much difficulty, looking for what he had left for him… but he had left this?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">*</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a long pause, Xia Lei snatched up that paper and was about to tear it into pieces when he suddenly thought, ‘Wait… Was da Vinci the type of person to do something like this? He left the password and map under the Mona Lisa, and directed me here. This was not all for a joke, right? Impossible. He must be hinting something to me. How did barbarians go to hell? Barbarians… Hell…’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s gaze went to the red cloth at the bottom of the stone sarcophagus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything in this maze had been black, but just this piece of cloth in the sarcophagus was red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Red represents flames. Another name of hell is Purgatory, where souls burn and suffer. Barbarians gives one the impression of violence and destruction. So how do barbarians go down to hell…’ A faint smile appeared in the corners of Xia Lei’s mouth. He grabbed the red cloth from the bottom of the stone sarcophagus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bottom of the stone sarcophagus was a black stone slab.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s left eye twitched, and his X-ray vision bore into the stone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Darkness. All he saw was darkness. It was a stone platform under the stone sarcophagus, and dirt underneath that. His X-ray vision was soon as its limits, and he could see no deeper. However, he quickly found where the mechanism was — in the corner of the stone sarcophagus. It was a square-shaped bit of stone material. The resin and black paint had made it seem like the bottom of the sarcophagus was a whole piece, but it was split, and individual pieces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei climbed into the stone sarcophagus and kicked at it. Nothing moved. He kicked a second time, hard. The resin filling the gaps loosened, and cracked. He then jumped up to stomp heavily down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crack! There was a light crack as the resin sealant was broken, and the square-shaped bit of stone material moved down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stone sarcophagus shook, and the entire bottom fell out immediately afterwards. Xia Lei hurriedly stuck his legs out and stood on the stone slabs. He felt like he was riding a lift.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stone slab fell to a depth of about ten metres, and stopped. A narrow doorway appeared in the stone wall on the left. Xia Lei threw the light stick in his hand into the doorway, and the space inside was illuminated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was an oval-shaped space with many things in it. There were several pieces of apparatus for experiments which looked simple but were very varied. There were things made of wood and metal, but their uses were unknown. There were also some works of art — some of the makeup of the human body, some sketches of architecture, and some oil paintings. There were several large glass bottles too, and these contained liquid with human body parts suspended in it. Eyes, hearts, brain tissue…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Was this da Vinci’s secret laboratory?’ Xia Lei quickly came to a conclusion. He took out a new light stick from his backpack, and lit it, then walked in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was indeed da Vinci’s secret laboratory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei walked about da Vinci’s laboratory, observing the things he had left behind as he pondered, ‘It’s not that difficult to build this laboratory but it was definitely a great labour to build the maze above this. Even if he made use of a natural cave, this was not something he can just build casually. Da Vinci was not very wealthy in his time period either. Where did he get the funds to build this maze?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s gaze fell upon a table as he mulled over these questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a cowhide notebook on the table. A thick notebook. There was also a piece of silver-coloured metal about the size of a cigarette box. He tried to judge where it had come off of by its shape, but could not tell what it was. Next to the metal was an oil painting of a starry sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was instantly drawn to the painting. His feet moved, almost on their own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light from the light stick fell on the painting and the stars sparkled. The stars seemed to come alive to Xia Lei after looking at them for some time. They seemed to have their own trajectories and were moving on their own. The stars were moving, and the nebula was moving slowly too. The painting gave one the impression of a slowly whirling mass of stars and nebulae. They rotated slowly, as if they were trying to suck something in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘A moving painting?’ Xia Lei was stunned, then surprised to discover that this painting had not been painted with paints, but with some sort of minerals.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as Xia Lei observed this painting, he failed to notice that the alloy necklace around his neck was being attracted like a magnet, going against the pull of gravity and floating silently in the air, moving closer to the painting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei noticed it, finally, when the alloy pendant floated up from under his chin and into his vertical line of sight. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘This… What’s going on here?’ Xia Lei was shocked, and he hurriedly backed away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bright white light suddenly shot from the pendant and into the oil painting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It all happened so quickly that it was all over when Xia Lei saw the white light appear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stars in the painting shone brightly when the white light went into the painting. It was like when light bulbs brighten from an electrical surge. Soon, he was unable to see stars and nebulae — a white light seared his vision.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light got brighter and brighter and Xia Lei had to cover his eyes with his hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And right then, he heard a familiar voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve been waiting for you for a long, long time…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Princess Yongmei!” Excitement burst in Xia Lei’s heart. He put down his hands and focused his gaze to look into the white light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outline of a woman appeared in the white light, but the shape was not fixed. She flickered from the outline of a Ming dynasty princess, to a female knight in the gear of the Knights Hospitaller, to a bloodthirsty swashbuckling female pirate, to a noble lady of Rome, to a priestess of ancient Egypt…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These figures flashed before Xia Lei’s eyes and he abruptly understood that the Princess Yongmei of the Ming dynasty whom he was familiar with was not the only one. She had appeared several times in history. These changes he saw now were a display of her identities in reverse. Her most recent identity had been that of Princess Yongmei, then the female knight, the pirate, the roman noble, the Egyptian priestess…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The changes went on, and even Xia Lei could not identify the time periods and identities any longer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The historical records of humans went back 5,000 years but she had gone beyond this limit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait for me. We will meet soon.” Princess Yongmei’s voice came from within the white light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just who in the world are you?” Xia Lei’s voice shook.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You will know.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where did you go since the last I saw you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was too weak back then. I had no choice but to rest. You have awakened me now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei suddenly thought of something, and hurriedly asked, “Ning Jing! What’s going on with Ning Jing? Did you make use of her to paint those paintings? To lure me here? And what’s with this painting?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted answers to all of his questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You will know.” It was the same answer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell me!” Xia Lei was not satisfied with an answer like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will find you.” This was her last sentence. The white light vanished as soon as she stopped talking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s gaze went to the painting and he was stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stars in the painting, and the nebulae had all vanished, leaving a blank canvas. It was so clean that there were no traces of it having been painted on at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘She…’ Xia Lei was perturbed. ‘Was the painting really painted with some sort of mineral, and those minerals are what she needed? It looks like it! She is a pure form of energy, and those minerals have the energy she needs! She appears every few hundred years, and the identities through the different time periods are an example of that. The Ming dynasty princess is the latest identity she used, and now that she has ‘awakened’ again… What sort of identity will she take on this time?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This question was unbelievable, even to him, and he felt it strange.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei stood quietly for a while, then opened up his alloy pendant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The AE capsule in it was in good shape, and the powder in it had no change. He let out a soft breath of relief. There was no loss to him so long as she had not damaged the AE capsule. As for what her identity was, and how she would appear before him… He would handle it later!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He put the last AE capsule back in the pendant and picked up the cowhide notebook. He opened it up to read its contents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first page read: If you’re reading this, it means you’ve come. I have completed the task she’s handed to me. I cannot help but imagine this very scene, and it excites me. I hope you will be able to solve the mystery of the box. I will be in Heaven awaiting your good news. She has also given me a piece of alloy. I have tried but failed at understanding its structure. Maybe you will be able to do it. The path out is before you. How did the Viking pirates enter?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei flipped the page. The second page was blank. He stared blankly for a bit, then flipped through the whole notebook to the end. All the other pages were blank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was it?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s spirits sank. He’d thought that this maze would be an end to the mysteries and that he would find answers here. Even if he did not find a final answer, he’d expected from important clues, at least. However, he had gained nothing great this time. What he had got was a sort of confirmation of the entity that was “Princess Yongmei” and that he had “awakened” her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s eyes went to the alloy. He reached out to pick it up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The alloy felt weightless in his hand. A piece of metal the size of a cigarette box should have some obvious weight, but this was even lighter than aluminium!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s heart thumped. He scratched the table with a corner of the alloy in his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Scritch! A deep groove formed in the hard wooden tabletop, like a plow going through a field.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s so hard! What alloy is this?” Xia Lei was surprised. He then walked to a metal tool and scratched at it with a corner of the alloy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Scree…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A big, obvious scratch appeared in the surface of the metal tool amid an ear-piercing screech. The alloy piece corner had had no damage at all!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei laughed all of a sudden. This piece of alloy was his greatest gain from this trip. If he could use this alloy in the production line of Thunder Horse Military Factory, then he would be able to produce the most powerful weapons in this world!**&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He put the alloy away, and strolled about da Vinci’s laboratory. All of da Vinci’s sketches and paintings went into his backpack. These things were loot for him too. Anything drawn by the great Leonardo da Vinci would be highly sought after by collectors, even if it’s of chicks eating grains!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he was all ready, Xia Lei stood at a stone wall with a hammer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How did the Vikings enter?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei swung the hammer…&nbsp;</span></p>
