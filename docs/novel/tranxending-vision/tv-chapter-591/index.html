 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One week later, China.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A military-use off-road vehicle came to the gates of Thunder Horse Military Factory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The guards stopped the car, but gave their greetings immediately after seeing Xia Lei seated inside, and opened the gates. The gate guard then called Lu Sheng immediately, and a large group of people came running over from the office building.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Sheng, Qin Xiang… Familiar face after familiar face. Xia Lei’s heart was warmed at seeing them again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And at the head of the group was a person he was most familiar with — Shentu Tianyin. He was a little surprised to see Shentu Tianyin. She had been managing Thunder Horse Group in his stead while he was in Germany, but she also had Vientaine Group to manage. The latter obviously was much bigger than Thunder Horse Group, and much more complicated. This was why she would normally be overseeing Vientaine Group, instead of being here right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was touched by this little surprise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hurry up and get out of the car,” said Long Bing. She had driven him back. “I still have to rush back to write my report.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nn.” Xia Lei did not say more. He opened the car door and got ready to alight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Yuyan opened the other door at the same time to get out of the car too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing wrinkled her brows. “What are you doing, Tang Yuyan? Aren’t you going back?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Yuyan gave a laugh. “We came here from far far away, and haven’t even had a glass of water to drink yet. What’s so bad about staying for a while longer? You need to write a report, and I need to write one too, but I’m in no rush so why are you rushing?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing glanced at Xia Lei, her eyes dark with annoyance and worry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei felt the same too, but he couldn’t say that Tang Yuyan was not welcome when she said she wanted to stay, right?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin had walked over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei quickly alighted and said with a smile, “I’m home, Wifey.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hubby,” called Shentu Tianyin. She did not care about the others around them, and burrowed into his embrace, putting her slender arms around his waist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing looked away. She was the most accommodating, and most open-minded of Xia Lei’s women, but her heart still felt a pang when she saw him embrace another woman, and she did not want to see it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin looked up from Xia Lei’s embrace, at the two women in the car. “Miss Tang, Miss Long, why aren’t you getting out?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s…” said Long Bing. “I am hurrying back to write a report, so not today.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Yuyan hesitated, and reached out a hand to close the car door. “I won’t be staying either. I have to hurry back and write a report too.” After a pause, she said, “What are you waiting for, Bing? Start driving.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing glanced back at her with an odd look in her eye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Yuyan rolled her eyes at Long Bing. “What are you looking at me for? Let’s go. Or do you want me to say something?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long BIng heard the message in those words, and she dared not stay. She pressed her foot to the clutch, then the accelerator, driving the military off-road vehicle away like she was fleeing the scene.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin watched the rapidly disappearing vehicle, and said softly, “They were strange.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei felt a headache coming on. “They are not ordinary people, so it’s normal for them to be a little strange.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that so?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei didn’t know what else to say. He had a guilty conscience, and was in the wrong. Fortunately, Qin Xiang and Lu Sheng came over to greet him and chat, which helped him get out of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How did it go in Germany?” asked Qin Xiang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It was all right,” said Xia Lei. Memories of his life hanging by a thread surfaced in his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where are Annina and Liu Zhengnan?” asked Lu Sheng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Liu Zhengnan was not feeling well, so I gave him a few days off to let him have a good rest. He’ll be back in a few days. Annina stayed in Germany, and she won’t be coming back. I will have Liu Zhengnan take over her old position, and he shall be Thunder Horse Military Factory’s chief engineer when he returns to work,” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Zhengnan was not sick at all, but in shock. He did need rest, so Xia Lei had given him some days off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin took Xia Lei by the arm, and said, “Come with me to the office. I’ll tell you about some of the situation during this period of time, and I’ll have to return to Vientaine Group. Your company should be under your management again since you’re back.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure.” Xia Lei nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one mentioned what happened in Germany, not Qin Xiang, not Lu Sheng, and not Shentu Tianyin. No one talked about Xia Lei being kidnapped by “terrorists”. This incident had not been reported extensively abroad either, and it was just the German government deliberately releasing some fake news in order to shirk the responsibility of breaking the agreement. This incident was also sealed away from China’s media, and none of the media outlets reported on it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Xiang sighed meaningfully as he watched Shentu Tianyin walk hand-on-arm with Xia Lei, towards the office building. “It’s still best to not be married. You’ll have to listen to everything your wife says if you get married. Ah, what a pain.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Sheng gave a laugh. “This is what it means when they say ‘the punishment is appropriately given by one and willingly accepted by the other’. What’s so disadvantageous about that?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So when are you getting married, Lu Sheng?” Qin Xiang looked at Lu Sheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Sheng paused. “Me? Heh heh… I don’t know if I’d get the chance to in this lifetime.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He thought of Liang Siyao, the only woman he had liked in his life. He’d thought that his chance had come after Liang Siyao had broken up with Xia Lei, but he had not even seen her face in a long, long time. His heart was growing cold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Xiang suddenly clapped Lu Sheng on the shoulder and said with a smile, “There’s something I’m going to say which you definitely won’t like to hear, but I’ll say it anymore. I know you like Liang Siyao. But even if you wait for her to come back, you won’t have a chance. Just forget about her, the sooner the better. Find yourself a woman who loves you, who will warm the bed for you, bear your children. That is the life you want.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Sheng gave a dry laugh, and let out a soft sigh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that this was the reality. Even if Liang Siyao came back, she would only have Xia Lei in her heart. It would be impossible for her to be with him. Vying with Xia Lei for a woman? Lu Sheng didn’t even want to think of it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the office, Xia Lei closed the door with his foot, enveloped Shentu Tianyin in his embrace, and bent his head to kiss her cherry lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mmnn…” Shentu Tianyin had not expected him to do that, and she was a little panicked. This bit of panic lasted for just two or three seconds, and her body grew soft afterwards, her breath coming in short gasps. She dived into the joy which Xia Lei brought her, and answered him passionately, giving and taking at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei let go of her only after several minutes. "I’ve missed you," he said tenderly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin pouted. "You had Long Bing and Tang Yuyan accompanying you on that mission. They are both very beautiful women. How could you have missed me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianying gave a puffing laugh. “I was just joking with you. You’re my man. I trust that you are mine, and that no one can snatch you away from me.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You are mine too, and no one can snatch you away from my side," said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, okay, we can stop being so lovey dovey here. We’ll talk when we get home tonight.” Shentu Tianyin pulled Xia Lei by the hand to the desk, and pressed him into the office chair. She smiled and said, “Sit down, Director Xia, and listen to my work report.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You smell good.” Xia Lei tilted his head and gave her firm, perky breasts a sniff.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin smacked him. "Don't be naughty. Sit properly."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei sat properly, but he sat like a kindergartener, waiting for the nice auntie to give him, the bestest little boy, a sweet. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“During your absence of almost three months, the Thunder Horse Group made an overall profit of 132,000,000. This is not the gross profit but the net profit, after deducting labour costs, material costs and other expenses. This also includes the loan repayment during this period of time.” Shentu Tianyin had a smile on her face. Of course she would be happy that her husband’s company was making such profits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Xia Lei said, "Ay, just that little bit? It’s not easy to make money these days. I’m sure I didn't make as much as you did.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can’t compare the businesses like this. Vientaine Group’s total assets are almost 100,000,000,000. That’s a huge amount of capital for organisational activities, and there are thousands of employees too. I’ll smash my own head into a wall if you have higher profits than me. Your current level of profitability is already quite astounding.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei laughed. He had just been kidding, and was actually very, very satisfied about being able to have a profit of 130,000,000 in three months.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin put her arms around Xia Lei’s shoulders, pressing her full breasts on them. “We are probably the highest-grossing husband and wife in the whole of China. No one can compare to us,” she said in his ear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re like the successful husband, and I’m the prosperous wife. Of course we’re the highest-grossing couple in China,” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re interrupting me again. Listen to what I have to say next.” Shentu Tianyin leaned in to Xia Lei's ear and blew warm breath into it. "I got to know your company very well in the past three months of your absence, so I started on a plan for expansion according to Thunder Horse Group’s situation. The plan includes expanding several production lines for the Gust assault rifle and the XL2500 sniper rifle. The new workshop is being built now. It’s great that you’re back. I think the production capacity of Thunder Horse military factory will quadruple in two months at most, with you personally involved.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei turned to look at Shentu Tianyin with an odd look in his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin paused. "You... you don’t like me doing this?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei stood abruptly from the office chair, pushing it away, and took Shentu Tianyin up in his arms. He walked towards the rest lounge, saying, “How can I not like it? I am overjoyed. I’d planned on starting the expansion after coming back, but you pre-started it for me. You’re so good, Wifey. What can I do to show my gratitude?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin blushed. “I know what bad thoughts are in your head, but... it's daytime now, and working hours. If someone comes in and sees us..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn't dare finish her thought. Just thinking about it made her shy and embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei kicked the door open and walked in with Shentu Tianyin in his arms, then closed the door with his heel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin grew nervous. "You really want it now, Hubby?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei smiled and said, “I have a feeling that I’ll be able to make your belly round this time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Really?" Shentu Tianyin hesitated for a second, then bit her lip gently. "Then... I’ll give it to you. You haven’t been handing in your homework to me for the past three months. Your pipes must be all clogged up.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clothing flew up, piece by piece. Some dropped to the floor, and some dropped to the sofa. Shentu Tianyin’s little underwear was fairly cheeky, and it clung on the hanging lamp in the lounge. The mattress rocked with the rhythm of love, swaying and creaking gently. Every echo, every note of their lovemaking was filled with happiness and beauty. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was great to be home.</span></p>
