 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

There were still applications trickling in with more people wanting to join Thunder Horse Manufacturing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The welfare package was good and the boss was also fairly generous. The plant also had a good number of young women and these were all attractive to the applicants. Thunder Horse Manufacturing had not been upgraded yet but the problem of acquiring talented manpower was already solved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no need for Xia Lei to worry about these matters since Liang Si-Yao and Du Bai from the human resources department would. What he needed to solve was a new problem and that was how to get clinical practice for acupuncture.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei begun his experiment when darkness descended.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His first experimental subject: a rabbit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He used rope to tie all four of the rabbit’s feet together and secure it on the table, then used a shaver to shave the fur off a part of the rabbit’s back, exposing the skin. He then used his fingers to pinch that part of skin and make a bruise. Finally, he used a needle on the rabbit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bruising of skin was due to injuries to the tissues under the skin, and rupturing and clotting of blood vessels. His plan was to use the silver needles to clear the clotting in the rabbit’s blood vessels and if he&nbsp;could do it, it meant that he could also use the needles on Shentu Ren’s blocked blood vessels. This was also why he had asked for a weeks’ time - he needed to have practical experience and evidence that it could be done before he performed the treatment on Shentu Ren.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normal people could only see the bruised skin of the rabbit under normal circumstances but Xia Lei could use his left eye to see what was going on under its skin. He knew exactly which blood vessels were broken and which were blocked. He could do acupuncture on a rabbit because of his incomparable ability and others would not be able to do it even if one were a practised traditional Chinese medicine doctor with fifty years of experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His left eye twitched and the inside view of the rabbit’s bruised skin entered Xia Lei’s vision. He focused on a blood vessel and inserted a silver needle. He had not researched a rabbit’s acupuncture points but he wasn’t going after those anyway; he was after its blood vessels. With the help of his eye, the needle in his hand went straight towards the blockage in the blood vessel and he angled the needle, slowly approaching the blockage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the silver needle got close to the blocked area, his arm trembled slightly and a flow of internal energy travelled from his arm and seemed to go through the silver needle in an instant. The silver needle vibrated as energy passed through it and its temperature increased by quite a bit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The internal energy which burst from the needle hit the blockage like floodwater bashing upon the gates of a dam. There was no sound but Xia Lei could see that the blood vessel had burst. The bruising on the rabbit’s skin darkened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘I used too much internal energy. Need to decrease it.’ Xia Lei summarised his own failure and focused on another capillary, continuing to apply internal energy to the needle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The capillary did not burst this time; the wall was split open. However, the blockage was mostly cleared and some blood trickled through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Third attempt: blood vessel burst…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fourth attempt: Blood vessel split…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fifth attempt…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He tried over and over, again and again. Xia Lei’s movements went from slow to quick and he gradually gained finer control over the internal energy he released. He was gaining more experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Early next morning, he gifted the bruised and battered rabbit to a neighbour and drove his car to work. Liang Si-Yao had asked him to go to her home after work the day before but he had declined. One week was a short time and he needed to practice to get his acupuncture skills to a certain level for the procedure. He could do his experimentation at the Liang household too but how would Liang Si-Yao and Liang Zheng-Chun view him if they saw him doing acupuncture on a rabbit? That was why he had chosen his own home as the location for his experimentation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A&nbsp;lorry carrying equipment from China Industrial Group was already parked on the premises when he arrived at the company. It was the last shipment of the upgrading equipment specified in the contract. They only needed to wait for the construction of the new workshop to be complete, the new recruits to work and equipment to be put into production and the upgrade of Thunder Horse manufacturing would be complete.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After instructing his workers to unload the goods, Xia Lei went to the office.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Si-Yao had already prepared a cup of Jin Jun Mei tea*. She was in black office-wear; black jacket, black woolen skirt, black heels and flesh-coloured stockings matched with a lotus leaf-collared white shirt. She was indescribably youthful, mature and sexy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei thought she looked tastier than the Jin Jun Mei tea she had prepared for him and he felt like tasting her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did you do at home last night?” Liang Si-Yao asked with a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Learning medicine,” answered Xia Lei honestly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Must you learn it at home?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei smiled. “Heroes in ancient times closed themselves off in caves so I need to find someplace to close myself up in too. I want to go to your place too but I won’t be thinking about medical studies with you around. Oh, I need a week. I’ll treat Shentu Tian-Yin’s father with acupuncture after this week and who knows, I may be able to heal him.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Si-Yao pouted her cherry lips. “Shentu Tian-Yin again. When will she return you to me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei rested his arms lightly around Liang Si-Yao’s waist and said gently, “Jealous? It’s not even real. You know I’m not that sort of person.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Si-Yao smiled then. She turned around and rewarded him with a kiss.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Women in love get jealous easily and even a ‘daughter of the world’ like Liang Si-Yao was no exception. She did get jealous but she was also broad-minded and easy to placate. Xia Lei just needed some gentle words to soothe her and she was fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ummm, cough.” Someone coughed in the doorway and the voice was uniquely reedy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei didn’t have to look back to know that it was Qin Xiang. He let go of Liang Si-Yao, then looked at Qin Xiang in the doorway and pretended to be annoyed as he said, “Don’t you know how to knock?” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Xiang shrugged, pointed at door against the wall and asked, “You mean I’m supposed to knock after I come in?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Si-Yao’s face was red as she quickly said, “I’ll go take a look in the R&amp;D department. Yin Hao and the guys said they had new plans. Um, you two go ahead and chat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Xiang raised his voice as Liang Si-Yao went past him. “I think our company walls - especially over here - should have notices stuck on them. ‘No love-love and no intimacy during work hours’.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liang Si-Yao glared at Qin Xiang and suddenly kicked him in the back of his leg.&nbsp;</span></p>

She’ll even hit me when she loses her temper.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Xiang smiled wryly. “Descendant of Yang Yan-Chun. I understand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should have found out something since you came, huh?” Xia Lei went on to business.&nbsp;</span></p>

How could I have sacrificed my sleep for nothing? That punk you told me to keep an eye on went to meet someone last night. Guess who.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei thought for a bit. “Gu Ke-Wu.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh?” Qin Xiang looked at Xia Lei, astonished. “How did you guess?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei gave a small laugh. “I caused an uproar at the Shentu residence. Shentu Tian-Yin is still in charge, so he has no power within the Shentu clan to use against me. He would want someone to help, and Gu Ke-Wu is the best candidate. Gu Ke-Wu likes Shentu Tian-Yin - this is no secret. He has always seen Shentu Tian-Yin as a prize so he will surely do something when I’m getting in his way - and that is what Shentu Tian-Feng would be happy to witness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Xiang gave Xia Lei a thumbs-up. “Awesome, but I don’t understand. You told me that the Shentu clan didn’t want Shentu Tian-Yin to fall in love or get married. Isn’t Shentu Tian-Feng smashing his own foot with a rock by going to look for Gu Ke-Wu?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s borrowing a knife to commit a murder. Shentu Tian-Feng doesn’t want Gu Ke-Wu to get Shentu Tian-Yin, of course. He’s not stupid. He knows what sort of person Gu Ke-Wu is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then you be careful. Gu Ke-Wu represents the Gu clan,” said Qin Xiang worriedly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll be careful. You be careful too,” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll continue to keep an eye on him and I’ll contact you if I have anything.” Qin Xiang left Xia Lei’s office.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei mulled over his thoughts by himself after Qin Xiang left. ‘I’d guessed that Gu Ke-Wu would do something when I decided to help Shentu Tian-Yin. I’m not afraid of him. If he tries something via legal channels, I’m a consultant for Bureau 101 - this identity can help me eliminate some problems. If he uses underhanded methods... He’d probably choose illegal methods, won’t he? What would he do…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was easy to predict what a normal person would do but people like this Gu Ke-Wu were very difficult to figure out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he was lost in thought, a middle-aged man in an impeccable suit appeared in the doorway and asked politely, “Excuse me, are you Chairman Xia?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei went forward to greet him. “Yes, I am. And you are?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nn, I’m the general manager for a real estate development company under the Vientaine Group conglomerate. I am Wan Da-Hai. I’ve some as representative for my company to talk about a collaboration with you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei was a little suspicious. “Collaborate on what?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wan Da-Hai reached out both hands to shake with Xia Lei, smiling as he said, “Our company has real estate in major cities across the country. We are in need of a large number of metal railings, steel fasteners and so on. I’d like to ask your company to manufacture these for us. This is not a small order. Our annual consumption is about 40 million.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei suddenly understood that this Wan Da-Hai had been sent by Shentu Tian-Yin. He definitely wouldn’t have come here to talk business if it weren’t for her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei laughed bitterly internally. ‘What is she doing? There’s no need for her to do this at all.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chairman Xia.” Wan Da-Hai looked somewhat worriedly at Xia Lei. “Please talk with me. The prices are all negotiable - what’s important is that we confirm that our two companies will be working together.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An order of 40 million was no small order. It needed at least two workshops to work at full power for a year to complete it. Profits for producing the parts for construction fences and steel fasteners were small but this was a long-term order. If he signed this contract, employees of two workshops would have work to do for a long time. Contracts like these were just what Thunder Horse Manufacturing needed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, let’s talk. Let’s use the market prices.” Xia Lei quickly made a decision. This was business sent by Shentu Tian-Yin but business was business and more of these were, naturally, welcome for Thunder Horse Manufacturing to grow. He wouldn’t reject this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was afternoon by the time he sent Wan Da-Hai off. He invited Wan Da-Hai for a meal but he had insisted on leaving and it was unclear if this was also because of Shentu Tian-Yin. Xia Lei thought of giving Shentu Tian-Yin a call to ask her about it but gave up on the idea after some thinking. It wouldn’t be appropriate to call to thank her for something like this.&nbsp;</span></p>

That night, he continued his acupuncture practice on that rabbit...&nbsp;</span></p>
