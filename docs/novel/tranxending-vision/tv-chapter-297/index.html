 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Xia Lei pulled Tang Yu-Yan along with him in a run in the dark; he was practically her eyes. Spears, arrows and bullets whooshed crazily behind them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kabir’s three underlings had just found cover and were looking for targets. However, they’d become targets themselves before they managed to fix on any targets of their own - three arrows shot down from the tree canopy and pierced their heads.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bureau 101 agents were hardier. They went straight into combat-mode after hearing Xia Lei’s warning shot and dove into the closest bit of forest to hide behind the trees to return fire. Their shots were focused and they were used to battle. They were at a disadvantage but they did not appear flustered. The defence line they formed blocked the White Hun Tribe’s first wave of attack and killed less than ten of the warriors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they were only able to block the first wave. Enemies came from both sides a minute later to tear them apart with AK47s and bows and arrows. Five Bureau 101 agents fell in pools of blood…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had come to rescue people but had died in a strange land. Life is but once, and who was to judge whether their deaths were noble?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one had the right to judge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only ones of the team to escape were Xia Lei and Tang Yu-Yan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tree after tree was left behind as they ran. There were no paths in the forest but both of them were practitioners of Tang Qinggong and the uneven ground was like flat ground to them; they ran like the wind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the White Hun warriors who were familiar with the terrain could not catch up with Xia Lei and Tang Yu-Yan, thanks to Tang Qinggong and Xia Lei’s left eye. They had escaped their encirclement before it was complete, becoming fish which had escaped the net.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They did not know how long nor how far they ran, but they ran till they fell to the ground in exhaustion, &nbsp;panting and gasping. Tang Yu-Yan, in particular, was gasping like a fish out of water, her chest rising and falling very visibly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was all dark above and there was no sound of gunshots, no swishing of arrows through the air, no footsteps and shouts of female White Hun warriors - just the rustling of the wind through the trees. The whole world was abnormally silent except for this small sound. It was so frighteningly quiet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Yu-Yan suddenly got to her feet a minute later and started walking towards the campsite with fire in her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei got to his feet as well and pulled Tang Yu-Yan to a stop. “What are you doing?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m going to kill those women! Revenge for my men!” said Tang Yu-Yan angrily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Calm down!” Xia Lei had a heaviness in his voice. “There’s just the two of us and there are over a hundred of them. We’ll die for nothing if we go!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Yu-Yan shook Xia Lei’s hand off. “You’re a coward! A coward!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei didn’t mind her calling him a coward; he understood how she felt. Those agents who had died in battle were her subordinates and had been in countless life-and-death missions with her. They had deep camaraderie through their battles. Even he felt terrible about the injustice of their deaths, so what must Tang Yu-Yan feel?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re not going? Then I will!” Tang Yu-Yan went back the way they came, fuming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei suddenly grabbed her by the waist and she thrust her elbow back to counterattack. They twisted, they fought, and they fell to the ground, rolling about on the forest floor. They wrestled for a bit before both calmed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Yu-Yan was not usually the sort of woman who would let her emotions get the better of her and she knew the consequences of her launching a counterattack - her fallen comrades would not come back to life and she would die herself. Who was going to complete the mission of rescuing the team of experts if she died?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you still on top of me for?” Tang Yu-Yan calmed down. She was not angry about him doggedly trying to stop her. She would probably have done something very stupid if he had not stopped her when she was being impulsive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei stayed atop her, legs wrapped around hers with&nbsp;their lower bodies pressed together, not giving her an inch of space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m fine now. You can let me go.” Tang Yu-Yan was beginning to feel uncomfortable. It hadn’t been anything strange when she’d lost control and gotten entangled with Xia Lei while being pushed to the ground but she was calm now and Xia Lei was still pressing against her intimately; it was a different feeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t do anything reckless if I let you go. Promise me and I’ll release you,” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I promise! Hurry up!” Tang Yu-Yan glared at Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei relaxed his hold on Tang Yu-Yan but he still stayed near her, watching her warily. He was afraid that she would go to start a reckless counterattack out of revenge and he was prepared to wrap her with his arms and press her down again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Yu-Yan displayed no signs of recklessness. She got to her feet; she had forgotten to zip up her half-open jacket. She looked blankly in the direction of the campsite and two streams of tears came from the corners of her eyes. She made no sound but the sorrow she felt was the deepest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei let out a small sigh and said consolingly, “We will surely get a chance to avenge them. Don’t be too sad. They came here to complete a mission so the best way to respect their memory is to complete the mission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Yu-Yan turned around abruptly and threw herself on Xia Lei’s shoulder, sobbing. Her crying was fairly controlled; she did not dare make too much noise. Her tears flowed in lines, wetting Xia Lei’s sweatshirt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei patted her lightly on her back and comforted her softly, “Cry, go ahead and cry. You’ll feel much better after crying it all out.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her bountiful bosom was squeezed against him and she was holding him lightly around the waist. His nose was filled with her scent too, but Xia Lei had no thoughts going in that direction, only heaviness. It was just him and Tang Yu-Yan left now and they were up against the entire White Hun Tribe. They still needed&nbsp;to rescue the trapped experts - was this possible?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then thought of his father again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second note his father had left him said to lose Tang Yu-Yan after he got to the White Hun Tribe, and the Russian woman named Yelena would appear to meet him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘How am I to lose Tang Yu-Yan in this situation? She’s not emotionally stable right now. Besides, there are White Hun warriors in this forest. Dad won’t risk sending his assistant Yelena to meet me, will he? Best to wait for a bit and act when the time is ripe,’ thought Xia Lei to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just then, Tang Yu-Yan raised her head from his shoulder and wiped at her tears. “I’m fine now. Let’s go. They won’t give up on looking for us so we have to leave this place as quickly as we can.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The familiar Tang Yu-Yan was back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No need to rush. We need to take inventory. I have all of my equipment, and some dry rations and water. Yours?” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei’s equipment and food supplies were all in his rucksack and these things were naturally with him if he had his rucksack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Yu-Yan waved the gun in her hand at him, then pulled out a piece of electronic equipment from her clothing. The red signal belaying the location of the experts was still flashing quietly, glowing faintly red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei let out a breath of relief when he saw the device. “Good that we still have that. It’ll be impossible to find the team of experts without it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How many bullets do you have left?” Tang Yu-Yan looked at Xia Lei and the sniper rifle on his shoulder.&nbsp;</span></p>

Those bullets were not important to him since he was not going to engage in close combat with those female White Hun warriors. He would slaughter them at over 3,000 metres next time!&nbsp;</span></p>

This was an indication of how quickly and how far Xia Lei and Tang Yu-Yan had run when fleeing for their lives.&nbsp;</span></p>

She could not see clearly in the dark but she suddenly sensed a resilience that even she did not have from Xia Lei. He always had this confident air about him - he did not cave, no matter how nasty the environment. This him was very attractive.&nbsp;</span></p>

The White Hun Tribe warriors will know where we are once the dogs catch up. There’s just us two - there’s no chance of us winning.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Lei suddenly looked up and at the canopy of the trees reaching skyward. “Up the trees. We’ll go by tree. Hunting dogs have good noses but they can’t smell our footsteps in the air.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Her body left the ground and she had grabbed a tree branch metres in the air in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</span></p>

The tree branch was high up too and he could not grab ahold of anything. He hurriedly grasped at Tang Yu-Yan’s legs.&nbsp;</span></p>

I can’t grab hold. Hold steady.” Xia Lei climbed up Tang Yu-Yan’s body. He climbed past her perky butt and the softness of it made him strangely nervous.&nbsp;</span></p>
