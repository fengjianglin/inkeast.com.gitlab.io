 <p><strong>Selling Water in the Desert</strong></p>
 <p>It did require a lot of bravery and courage as a roadside machine shop owner to ask a government-owned enterprise to procure land for a machining plant because of a collaboration. Mu Jian-Feng was here because he admired Xia Lei’s character and his ability.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Jiang Xin went close to Xia Lei and spoke in a low voice, “Mr Xia, do you know who he is? He is our boss!”</p>
 <p>Only then did Xia Lei know Mu Jian-Feng’s identity and it shocked him so much his mouth was agape and he was tongue-tied.</p>
 <p>Liang Si-Yao discovered Mu Jian-Feng and Jiang Xin’s arrival at that moment and seemed to guess something so she came walking out.</p>
 <p>“Chairman Xia, please may I trouble you to have a look at this recruitment document to see if it’s acceptable?” Liang Si-Yao specially brought out the freshly-printed recruitment document and handed it to Xia Lei for his perusal.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei could tell what Liang Si-Yao was trying to do and he smiled as he said, “Elder Mu, Mr Jiang, let me introduce you. This is my assistant, Liang Si-Yao.”</p>
 <p>Liang Si-Yao followed up with a respectful bow, “Hello, Elder Mu, Mr Jiang.”</p>
 <p>Not a handshake but a respectful bow - it was a gesture of great respect in the workplace.</p>
 <p>Jiang Xin spoke respectfully, “Hello, Miss Liang. May I ask which university you graduated from and what you majored in?”</p>
 <p>“I studied at Harvard University in America and I graduated from the School of Business, majoring in Business Management. I’ve worked in an e-Commerce company and a venture capital company in America.” After a brief introduction of her resume, she smiled again, “Now I work for Chairman Xia.”</p>
 <p>Mu Jian-Feng and Jiang Xin could not help exchanging looks after hearing her speak. Both of them looked astonished. They knew that Harvard Business graduates were very well sought after in America, much less China. If she were willing, she could have her pick of any of the listed public companies to work in at a salary of at least 500,000. An elite talent such as herself actually chose to work for a just-beginning Xia Lei!</p>
 <p>Xia Lei took note of Mu Jian-Feng and Jiang Xin’s reactions and was secretly happy and proud.</p>
 <p>“Miss Liang, would you be willing to come to our company to work if I offered you a salary of 500,000?” said Mu Jian-Feng.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei’s smile froze on his face and he thought ‘What’s with this Elder Mu? If he wants to poach my employee, he should try to do it behind my back, right? He’s actually poaching her right in front of me? Is he completely overlooking me or is he not planning to help me get that piece of land at all?’</p>
 <p>Xia Lei was instantly flooded with doubt and worry.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for your kind offer but I would rather stay with Thunder Horse Manufacturing than go to China Industrial Group,” said Liang Si-Yao.</p>
 <p>“Eh?” Mu Jian-Feng looked interested, “Miss Liang, could you elaborate and tell us why?”</p>
 <p>“Your company is big and offers an attractive salary but those are just temporary advantages. Staying in Thunder Horse Manufacturing gives me greater opportunities for growth. My current income is definitely below 500,000 a year but it will surely grow in the future. This is my reasoning for income. Another reason is prospects. Thunder Horse Manufacturing has great prospects that an average company cannot match. You acknowledge this too, otherwise you wouldn’t be here, correct?” said Liang Si-Yao.</p>
 <p>To sum it up, would Mu Jian-Feng and Jiang Xin have come here today if Xia Lei was not the only person who could process the high precision parts they needed in the whole of China?</p>
 <p>“Impressive. Not so simple, eh? Young people these days are much more impressive than us in our time,” chuckled Mu Jian-Feng, “Miss Liang, I was just joking earlier. You can go back to work.”</p>
 <p>“Mm. Yes, Elder Mu.” Liang Si-Yao turned and walked away.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei called her to stop and handed the recruitment document to her, “You can take charge of this. There’s no need to ask me.”</p>
 <p>Liang Si-Yao nodded and brought the papers back inside Thunder Horse Workshop. The employees of Thunder Horse Workshop looked curiously at Mu Jian-Feng and Jiang Xin outside the shop and whispered amongst themselves. After Liang Si-Yao entered the workshop, she indicated that they should stop looking and continue working and they stopped their discussion and started working again.</p>
 <p>She was of a higher rank than them as assistant to the Chairman so they had to listen to her. The employees of Thunder Horse Workshop were not particularly cultured but one of the good points they had was that they were clear about who the boss was. They would do as the boss said without complaints.</p>
 <p>Mu Jian-Feng spoke to Jiang Xin, “Jiang, tell the workers to unload the materials and bring them into the workshop. Mr Xia doesn’t have many people so we won’t use his manpower.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Elder Mu.” Jiang Xin went to carry out his instructions.</p>
 <p>“Walk with me, Mr Xia,” said Mu Jian-Feng to Xia Lei.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei had guessed that this would come and he said, “Of course, let’s have a walk.”</p>
 <p>The two of them walked, one old and one young, following the pedestrian path and talking as they walked.</p>
 <p>“Mr Xia, my main purpose in coming today is not to help you get that piece of land. Do you know what I came for today?” After some small talk, Mu Jian-Feng changed the topic to his main purpose.</p>
 <p>“I can roughly guess. Elder Mu, you came to Hai-Zhu this time to see if I can really upgrade normal lathes to the most advanced lathes of the European and American standards, correct?” said Xia Lei.</p>
 <p>“Good guess. Since you’ve guessed it, can you give me an answer that would reassure me?” Mu Jian-Feng stopped in his tracks and looked Xia Lei straight in the eyes, as if to see through all his secrets.</p>
 <p>“I have already told Mr Zhou Wei and Mr Jiang Xin that I can do it. But first, I’ll need to go overseas and see the blueprints and the real thing,” said Xia Lei.</p>
 <p>“That’s no problem. You can go overseas any time. We also have channels which can arrange for you to see the blueprints and most advanced lathes. When are you leaving?”</p>
 <p>“After my company is established,” said Xia Lei.</p>
 <p>Displeasure flashed in Mu Jian-Feng’s eyes, “Mr Xia, you still want us to procure that piece of land for you?”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei nodded, “Yes. I am only asking for this one thing. I won’t ask for anything else in the future.”</p>
 <p>Mu Jian-Feng continued walking forward, “Mr Xia, what you ask for is difficult.”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei didn’t say anything but he thought ‘You have to help even though you don’t want to’.</p>
 <p>“How much money do you have on hand right now?”</p>
 <p>“About 6,400,000 in total.”</p>
 <p>“What?” Mu Jian-Feng looked at Xia Lei in surprise, “You only have about 6,000,000 and you want us to help you procure land that is worth hundreds of millions? Are you kidding me?”</p>
 <p>Mu Jian-Feng’s tone turned sour right away but Xia Lei did not lose patience. He spoke lightly, “Yes, just 6,000,000 or so, just that. I still have to use it to build my machining plant, buy more equipment, hire more workers and so on. I only wish I could turn every cent into ten thousand.”</p>
 <p>Mu Jian-Feng sneered, “I thought you had money and at least seven or eight hundred million. We could loan you the money if you were a little short and make use of our executive relationship to expropriate that piece of land. Now you’re telling me that you have only around 6,000,000 and this is also to be used for building a machining plant, buying more equipment and hiring more workers? Young man, are you making some sort of joke for this old man to laugh at?”</p>
 <p>Mu Jian-Feng’s tone was getting more and more impolite. Xia Lei’s temper was also rising and he, too, sneered, “Elder Mu, if this were to happen five or six years in the future I wouldn’t need your help at all. It’s true that I have no money now. I am doing this in the interest of our future collaboration.”</p>
 <p>“You make it sound like it’s as easy as lighting a wick aflame. Young man, I have to remind you that what you want is land that is worth hundreds of millions!” Mu Jian-Feng was blunt, “Why do you insist on that piece of land when you don’t have the money for it? You can pick something in the rural areas - a million for dozens of acres. Why? Give me an explanation!”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei wrinkled his brows, “You think I’m swindling you?”</p>
 <p>“I shall consider it so if you don’t have a reasonable explanation,” said Mu Jian-Feng.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei snorted, “If you really think that way then there is no need for us to talk further.”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t mean anything. I will complete the purchase order from Mr Zhou Wei, then you can go get someone more qualified than I to do it for you. I won’t process so much as a screw for you in the future.”</p>
 <p>“You punk.” Mu Jian-Feng was so mad his whiskers puffed. Nobody had ever dared to talk to him like that - Xia Lei was the first.</p>
 <p>“Keep your money and your connections. Goodbye, Elder Mu.” Xia Lei threw these words out and turned to leave.</p>
 <p>“Wait!” Mu Jian-Feng grew anxious and grabbed Xia Lei by the arm.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei did not break free from his grasp for fear that the old man would be flung to the ground. That would be taking the act too far.</p>
 <p>“What sort of foul temper is this, young man?” Mu Jian-Feng glared unhappily at Xia Lei, “I could be your grandfather. You can’t take criticism from an old grandfather?”</p>
 <p>“I didn’t say anything but can I be happy about you, Elder Mu, seeing me as a swindler?” said Xia Lei.</p>
 <p>“I’m sure you wouldn’t dare to swindle China Industrial Group. I think you know what sort of company it is,” said Mu Jian-Feng.</p>
 <p>“Of course I know. It’s like the Lockheed Martin* company in America, producing weapons of war for the country. I wouldn’t be so stupid as to try to cheat you guys of your money even if I were tired of living. Furthermore, what I want is land, not money. Can I sell that piece of land? Can I take that piece of land overseas?” said Xia Lei.</p>
 <p>Mu Jian-Feng’s features softened but his mouth was still firmly set, “But that piece of land is worth hundreds of millions. Your company’s value is low but the value of the piece of land is high. Property companies would assess the value and you’ll be instantly worth hundreds of millions. Does that seem reasonable to you?”</p>
 <p>“Does it not seem reasonable to you?”</p>
 <p>“It’s unreasonable.” Mu Jian-Feng shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Let me put it in a metaphor. I am not selling water next to a water company but in the desert. You are my client, my desert-wandering client. Strict technology blocks have been put in place by Europe and America so your stored water has long been used up. Just at this time when you guys are extremely thirsty, you discovered me selling this water. So, do you think I’ll sell this water to you guys if you give me just one yuan?” said Xia Lei.</p>
 <p>Mu Jian-Feng paused for half a beat then suddenly started chuckling, “Well said. A very fitting metaphor. You are the water seller in the desert. Is this also why you are so secure in your knowledge that you will have backing and are extorting us because of our weakness?”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei shrugged, “Whatever you want to say. Cheating, extorting because of weakness - it doesn’t matter to me. I don’t care what you think of me. I just want to build my machining plant on that piece of land.”</p>
 <p>Mu Jian-Feng sighed, then headed back.</p>
 <p>Xia Lei stood on the spot and did not move.</p>
 <p>Mu Jian-Feng walked two steps, then looked back and shouted, “What are you still standing there for, boy? Take me to see that piece of land.”</p>
 <p>Xia Lei smiled, “Sure, Elder Mu. I’ll take you to see it right away.”</p>
 <p>Mu Jian-Feng smiled wryly and shook his head, “You’re the most stubborn boy I’ve ever met.”</p>
