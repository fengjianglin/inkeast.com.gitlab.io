 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Jianfeng had always been a tough guy, and he was still looking for ways to fight back and turn the tide though he had been forced to wade into deep waters. Ye Kun could never surpass Mu Jianfeng in this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was silent, seemingly feeling the jab of something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Kun sneered, “Guilty now, Xia Lei? You want USD400,000,000? Can you take that money with a clear conscience even if we give it to you? Don’t open your mouth so wide if you have no appetite for it!” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei kept his silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Jianfeng said, “Let’s not talk about 400,000,000 or 200,000,000. Just USD50,000,000 will do. This is a huge sum too. I believe you’ll be able to persuade your prince friend, won’t you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He seemed to mean something else by that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei raised his head at that and looked at Mu Jianfeng and Ye Kun. He gave a laugh. “USD 50,000,000? You actually dared to suggest it? Even if I agree to it, Prince Khalifa won’t. What is USD 50,000,000 to him? Let me remind you that it is not me who is asking for this money but the Desert Guardian company. This is an agreement between you and them, and I’m not involved. I am just helping my client out in my own capacity.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop with the act. Speak. How much do you want?” Ye Kun had lost his patience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei spoke softly. “We’re rivals and you two have given me a lot of trouble, but I’ll give you a way out since you’re my countrymen.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Jianfeng and Ye Kun couldn’t help exchanging looks. Their eyes were full of distrust. Would Xia Lei be so generous? They did not believe it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t believe me? No matter. I’ll tell you anyway.” Xia Lei continued, “Prince Khalifa has no lack for money. He lacks guns. The Middle East is in a state of chaos and Prince Khalifa wants his troops to be the best in the Middle East. My Gust assault rifle can help him accomplish this, and it is the weapon he wants.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And what does this have to do with us?” said Mu Jianfeng coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It doesn’t seem related to you on the surface but you can be linked to it if you want,” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you mean by that?” asked Ye Kun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Didn’t you guys process a lot of parts for the Shenwu assault rifle? Sell those parts to me at a low price, and it’ll account for a portion of the liquidated damages. Additionally, your two companies can keep supplying Thunder Horse Military Factory with the parts we need to offset the rest of the damages. The newly-processed parts can be bought at an objective price. You’ll soon be able to offset the damages in this way,” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Jianfeng and Ye Kun were rooted to the spot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Xia Lei’s plan. The solution he had proposed to them was what he had schemed for.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a brilliant move on the chessboard that business.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking money from a state-backed enterprise? Xia Lei was not so foolish. If he did take money, he would have to pay for the consequences one day, even if his plan was foolproof. Purchasing the parts which Hanwu Weapons and China Industrial Group had already manufactured not only solved the problem of Thunder Horse Military Factory needing parts, but also gave one the impression that Thunder Horse was benevolent. After all, the Shenwu assault rifle could not be produced anymore, and those parts would have to go to waste otherwise. Being able to sell these parts was beneficial to both parties.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Additionally, Hanwu Weapons and China Industrial Group would be able to sell parts they produce in the future to Thunder Horse Military Factory at a fair price, so what could they complain about to Xia Lei?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through this sort of cooperation, Thunder Horse would essentially make Hanwu and China Industrial its logistics base, and these two companies would help boost Thunder Horse expansion greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, well, Xia Lei. I’ve really underestimated you.” Mu Jianfeng smiled wryly. He looked like he had aged in an instant. “Ye Kun and I were aiming to drive you out of the market, but you’ve managed to thrive in spite of that. On top of that, you’re now trying to make us into your stepping stone for greater success. An excellent move! This won’t be seen as taking the nation’s money but as you saving the government’s business and attaining glory for the nation. You’ll be lauded as a capable man and a man with a patriotic heart. You’ve taking all the advantage - what is left for us, then?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The advantage you can get out of this is a solution to your problem with Desert Guardian. What else do you want other than this?” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Add one more thing,” said Mu Jianfeng. “Thunder Horse Military Factory will not sue Hanwu Weapons for copyright infringement.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Kun’s eyes lit up and he seemed to see a ray of hope. “Yes, this has to be added! You can’t have all the advantages,” he said excitedly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Xia Lei pretended to hesitate. He had his own plans.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xia Lei, you have to compromise a little. We can buckle down and give you USD 400,000,000 too, but I believe you have your sights set on more than this money. The military contract is already yours. Your ambition however, tells me that you’ll aim for the international market too. If that’s the case, you’ll need large volumes of high-quality parts, but based on Thunder Horse Military Factory’s production capabilities, you’ll need several years just to increase your production capacity. Time is money. Would you miss out on this rare opportunity for expansion?” said Mu Jianfeng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Jianfeng and Ye Kun had been scheming to crush Thunder Horse Military Factory just yesterday, but they were now on Xia Lei’s side and looking into the future for Thunder Horse, making suggestions. Life really was unpredictable! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re getting us to do things for you now. Do you really want to force us into a corner? All right, assume that Thunder Horse sues us, and we resign. A whole new set of management will take our places. Would these new people be willing to work with you, and make parts for Thunder Horse Military Factory? That’s a pipe dream. The new management will be like us. They will want to drive you out of the market,” said Ye Kun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmm… We can discuss this. Mr Ling has asked me for the relevant evidence, and I haven’t handed it to him yet,” said Xia Lei slowly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Kun and Mu Jianfeng couldn’t help exchanging looks again. Their eyes had a glimmer of joy in them now. What they wanted to avoid the most was the impending investigation, and to keep their positions. And only Xia Lei was able to give them what they wanted. It seemed like Xia Lei was hinting at something to them now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell us, Xia Lei. Let’s not go in circles. Tell us what other requirements you have,” said Mu Jianfeng. “We have what you want and you have what we want. This exchange will benefit both of us. Since this is a win-win for us, you should be more sincere.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei sighed. “All right, I can agree to not suing you, and not handing in the evidence for the investigation. However, we’ll have to sign a new contract clearly stating the price, quantity and deadlines for the shipment of the parts. I have to be cautious with people like you, because I don’t trust you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Jianfeng and Ye Kun huddled together, whispering.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Jianfeng then said, “Deal. But you have to give the evidence to us.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure, no problem. I’ll give you the evidence after we’ve signed the contract.” Xia Lei agreed quickly this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The video evidence could be copied and the paper evidence too. Mu Jianfeng and Ye Kun could take all the time they needed. Xia Lei would always have a copy, just to have them in the palm of his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then let’s go through the details of the agreement,” said Mu Jianfeng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need. I’ve had it prepared for you two.” Xia Lei opened his briefcase and took out six copies of a contract. It was a thick stack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Jianfeng stared dumbly at the stack of paper for a while, then said, “You… you’d predicted that we would work with you? You’ve prepared everything!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chairman Mu, you’re an intelligent man. Do you think you’ll have any choice other than to work with me? Take a look at the contract and sign if you have no problems with it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Jianfeng and Ye Kun picked up a copy of the contract each, and started reading…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hours later, all three of them signed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei put four copies for Thunder Horse Military Factory in his briefcase and placed a USB stick on the table. “Take it. This is the evidence you wanted.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Kun snatched it up, as if afraid that Xia Lei would take it back. He said probingly, “Xia Lei, you don’t have a copy, do you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei laughed. “Am I that sort of person? I’m only concerned about the quantity of the parts you will produce and their shipping times. This is your only chance, and it’s your own problem if you don’t take it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei lifted his briefcase and walked out the rest lounge when he finished speaking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His plan was complete, and this was the result he had wanted when he put it all in motion a month ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a more advantageous solution than forcing Mu Jianfeng and Ye Kun out of the equation. He would just only have the rush of kicking them out, and there would be nothing after that rush had faded. Making them work for him, and making Hanwu Weapons and China Industrial manufacture parts for him would give him the needed boost to expands Thunder Horse Military Factory. This was the smart choice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it!” Mu Jianfeng slapped the surface of the table after Xia Lei exited the room. “He was just a roadside shop owner when I saw him two years ago. He’s now making me work for him!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t take this lying down either.” Ye Kun seethed, “But what can we do other than to work with him?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just then, Ye Xiaoqi appeared in the doorway and said cautiously, “Chairman Ye, Chairman Mu, Xia Lei and the three middle-eastern men have left.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Kun looked at her and said coldly, “Ye Xiaoqi, go report at the Production Department tomorrow. I hear they’re lacking a cleaner. Someone new will take your place tomorrow.”&nbsp;</span></p>
