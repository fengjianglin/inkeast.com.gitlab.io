 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The expression of the Head of CIA’s European Branch turned ugly. He had given Xia Lei a minute to consider dropping the weapon and to surrender but Xia Lei had only given him 30 seconds to think about it, or he would commit suicide. His orders were to capture Xia Lei alive, not bring his corpse back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This operation was akin to going back in time to capture da Vinci or Einstein, only to bring their dead bodies to the present time — What would be the point of that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Xia Lei were to die here, it would be a disastrous blow to the AE Research Centre. This would also be a tremendous loss for the United States.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were all factors which Sean needed to consider.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No—” yelled Long Bing at Xia Lei. “Go! I don’t want you to save me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Yuyan suddenly turned and landed a kick on a CIA agent. Her hands were bound by cable ties, but her skill with her legs was not affected. Her kick landed heavily, and the CIA agent fell to the ground. He would probably have been sent flying if he had the build of an Asian. A man of at least 120 kilograms had been kicked to the ground by a petite woman! Tang Yuyan’s formidability shocked the big group of CIA agents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Yuyan had the same thought as Long Bing — to sacrifice her life so that Xia Lei could live.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The CIA agent who had been kicked to the floor was outraged at this humiliation, and he raised his gun, aiming it at Tang Yuyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bastard!” Sean kicked the gun out of the hands of the agent. “What do you think you’re doing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The CIA agent looked at his superior in surprise but did not move to pick his gun up. Judging by the ferocity in Sean’s gaze, he might just get shot by Sean first if he grabbed his gun and shot Tang Yuyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was fairly nervous too because he’d thought that the CIA agent would shoot and kill Tang Yuyan. Fortunately, Sean had moved to stop the agent. Xie Lei did not wish to experience such misfortune for a second time. “Time’s up!” he said, his voice heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean looked at Xia Lei and asked coldly, “Would you shoot?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei scoffed. “I’m dead if I wind up in your hands anyway. It’s more straightforward to kill myself. Since I’m dead either way, I have nothing to be afraid of. You, on the other hand… You won’t live for much longer if I die here, huh?” Xia Lei suddenly yelled at Sean, “I’ll say just this — Let them go right now, and I will go with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean finally made a decision. “Release them. Let them go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two agents promptly pulled out their military knives, and cut the cable ties off Long Bing’s and Tang Yuyan’s wrists, then another agent cut the cable ties around Liu Zhengnan’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Give them a mobile phone,” Xia Lei said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean gave them a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A CIA agent returned Long Bing’s phone to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing took the phone but did not move. She looked at Xia Lei, and her tears flowed silently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei made a pretense of being fierce and bellowed at Long Bing, “Why are you still standing here? Scram! I don’t wish to see you again!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It would have been better if Xia Lei had not been fierce. Long Bing’s tears flowed faster at his fierceness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You dummy…” Tang Yuyan’s voice was choked with emotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t let this all become meaningless. Go. All of you.” Xia Lei finally softened his tone. “Get out of here, get somewhere safe, and give me a call.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Director Xia…” &nbsp;Liu Zhengnan cried too. He could only be described as Xia Lei’s employee in the past, but he was Xia Lei’s Brother now, after all that he had experienced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing could no longer control her emotions. She took quick steps towards Xia Lei, ignoring the black sea of guns, ignoring the cold stares around her. She spread her arms and closed Xia Lei in a hug. There were thousands of words in her heart but she could say none in that moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei cupped her cheeks and kissed her on the lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmmph…” A muffled sound came from Long Bing’s throat. She quickly got into the kiss, and locked lips with Xia Lei in sorrowful abandon. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How romantic.” Sean sneered, “I can give you a few minutes for your last bit of romance. You two can have one round, haha.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei ignored Sean’s taunts. There was no way that Sean would give them time to have one last fling. Long Bing pressed against him, and wrapped herself around him, disregarding everything else. Xia Lei quietly grabbed the alloy necklace around his neck and yanked it off, then reached his hand into Long Bing’s collar, into her bra.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing froze instantly. She didn’t dare believe that Xia Lei would have that sort of need at this time, especially in front of so many people. However, she swiftly discovered that he had put something in her bra, something cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei kissed her ear and whispered in her ear, “Bring this back. This is very important to me. Don’t tell anyone, and wait for me to come back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing paused, then nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei pushed her away, and said fiercely, “Scram, don’t let me see you again!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing bit her lip and turned to walk away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Yuyan suddenly walked towards Xia Lei. She seemed to want to do the same as Long Bing had done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go!” Long Bing pulled Tang Yuyan by the arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” Tang Yuyan started to say something, then stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Bing gave no explanations. She went out the door, pulling Tang Yuyan with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Be safe, Director Xia,” said Liu Zhengnan. He then followed Long Bing and Tang Yuyan out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The trio quickly disappeared from Xia Lei’s line of sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei said, “Give me my phone, I will leave with you after I confirm that they are safe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Give it to him,” said Mark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The phone which Mark Amin had taken was quickly returned to Xia Lei’s hand, and Xia Lei gripped it tightly. A mobile phone had never been so important to him as it was right now. His phone concerned the lives of Long Bing and Tang Yuyan, making it especially important. It also involved the last AE capsule.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He actually had the thought of taking the last AE capsule earlier, but he had immediately had the other thought that he would definitely have to go through another state of evolution even he could not predict if he did so. He could die, or he could become an existence like Princess Yongmei. Whichever the result was, it was not something he wanted to see.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Additionally, eating the last AE capsule would covertly give the AE Research Center an excellent opportunity to study him. This was because his body’s evolution would not be immediately visible even if he took the last AE capsule — it needed a process. And this process, if discovered by the AE Research Center, would maybe earn the AE Research Center some great biotechnology due to America’s strength in science and technology. Xia Lei did not want to see a result like this either. And so, he gave up on the thought of consuming the last AE capsule after weighing the pros and cons over and over, and got Long Bing to take it back to China.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the best way to take care of it. First of all, it did not change his prior intention to decide to take the last AE capsule only after solving its mysteries. Secondly, was that the last AE capsule would be in Long Bing’s hands if he were not able to return to China. Long Bing would hand it in to the nation if he died. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are the first person to use your own life as a threat against me, Xia Lei.” Sean’s voice held a trace of ridicule. “This is very interesting, isn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the behaviour of a victor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei took no notice of Sean, and looked out the window. He saw the German Special Forces seizing the mobile phones of the guests to check if any of them had taken photographs or videos. What happened here must not be made known to the public.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei saw Sylvia and Rihanna. The two women were standing in the circle of confinement, looking over at him. Sylvia’s gaze was full of worry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei couldn’t help the faint, wry smile in the corners of his lips. He knew that Sylvia had certain thoughts about him but he was in no mood to pick up girls now. Sylvia was fated to be just a passer-by in his life, and perhaps he would remember what she looked like after brushing past her, but their paths would not intersect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei suddenly turned and walked towards the oil painting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you doing?” yelled Sean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sounds of guns being raised could be heard from all around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I like this painting and I’m just taking a look at it. There’s no need to get nervous, guys,” said Xia Lei nonchalantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The oil painting depicted a female pirate with two faces. She held a shield in one hand, and brandished a hand-axe, a weapon favoured by Viking pirates, in her other hand at a burly Gaul. She seemed to possess a miraculous power which could not only cleave her enemies into pieces, but rent through space-time — an eternal existence!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Was this really painted by da Vinci?’ Xia Lei couldn’t help imagining it. ‘Sylvia said that this female pirate had her revenge for her comrade in the end, and built a martyr’s town here, for it to become a gathering place for Viking pirates. How did she get her revenge? Could it be… that Princess Yongmei helped her? Was this why da Vinci painted Princess Yongmei’s face below hers?’ &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was in dire straits, but he was thinking thoughts such as these instead of how to escape. Xia Lei found himself rather laughable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean did not stop Xie Lei from admiring Mark Armin’s heirloom painting. He was waiting for Long Bing’s phone call too, and he would take Xia Lei away once he confirmed that the three people had left and were safe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few minutes later, Xie Lei suddenly put his fist through the oil painting. The hundreds-year-old painting was instantly destroyed, and the female pirate’s face was gone. Only a hole was left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only he had discovered this hidden secret of Princess Yongmei’s face in the painting, and he too, would be the last to know. He was not going to leave an opportunity for Mark or his descendants to discover this secret. Of course, there was also no reason to not make Mark pay for setting him up like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did you do?” said Sean angrily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xie Lei turned and shrugged. “I was unhappy, so I vented. I can’t? You can get Mr Mark Armin to contact my lawyer. I am willing to stand in the dock, and compensate him fully for his loss.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ring ring ring...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The satellite phone rang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xie Lei answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re safe.” It was Long Bing’s voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nn. Go,” said Xie Lei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Promise me that you’ll come back alive, or I’ll go to America to look for you. I will go down to Hell with you too, if you die.” Long Bing’s voice was cold, determined.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xie Lei hung up and walked to Sean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A group of CIA agents escorted Xia Lei to a Chevrolet Suburban, and he got in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sylvia stood in the group of people, gaping at Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mark Armin walked into his living room. His gaze went to the hole in the heirloom painting and he let out an abrupt scream before his vision went dark, and he collapsed to the floor in a faint. &nbsp;</span></p>
