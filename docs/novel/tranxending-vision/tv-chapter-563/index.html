 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Siyao, I would really like to talk with you for a whole day if I have the chance to, but you know that this isn't a safe place. If you have anything to say, you can tell me now," Xia Lei was worried about Liang Siyao's appearance here, not only about her safety but also about Shentu Tianyin discovering her presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao was different from other women. She was his first known girlfriend, so Shentu Tianyin knew about her presence. If Shentu Tianyin were to find out that he and Liang Siyao had met here, there would be no way he could explain himself, even if he grew eight mouths to talk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao took a deep breath. "Okay then, I'll make this quick. I know that you're experiencing problems, which is why you're here getting this checkup. Back then, I took some body fluid samples from you and sent a part of it to the AE Research Center for research."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You got their research report?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes. I am the CIA's Chief of Asia now. You are the CIA's most important mission in Asia, and they have to provide me with all the information about you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei smiled wryly. "Congratulations on your promotion."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao's expression darkened. "Don't say that, my heart will hurt. My position as the Chief is not stable. They just couldn't find anyone more suitable right now. They had actually planned to dispose of me when the previous Chief was in charge. The competition in the CIA is very fierce. I can be disposed of at any time."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then why are you still working there?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao started tearing up once again. "Do you think I want to stay there? I don't. I came to see you, and even helped your father. Do you still not understand my feelings?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei's heart softened immediately, and became a mess of emotions. He wasn't a cold-hearted person. In truth, this isn't the first time Liang Siyao had helped him. If it weren't for her help in Korea, he probably would've been captured by the Korean police and the CIA special agents. And this time, she was risking her life here to help him. How could he not know of her feelings?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Never mind…” A faint smile of pain appeared in the corners of her mouth. "According to the report by the AE Research Center, I am convinced that it would be difficult for you to make a woman pregnant."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Difficult?" Xia Lei's heart thumped "So you're saying that it is difficult but still possible for me to make a woman pregnant?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't be too anxious.” Liang Siyao continued, "According to the report details, your sperm is very powerful, very perfect, and very balanced. In their words, each of the sperm from your body is a powerful warrior, and with high IQ too."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This description rendered him speechless, and also put a cloud of question marks in his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao continued her explanation. "You've learned biology. You should know that in order for a man to make a woman pregnant, the man's sperm would be fighting each other in the woman's body after they have been injected inside. They follow the law of nature, the survival of the fittest. Only the strongest sperm will reach its destination, fuse with the woman's egg, and finally evolve into a child."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I know that but my sperm… You said that it so powerful, and very good, so why can't I get a woman pregnant?" Xia Lei couldn't help feeling awkward about talking about such things with Liang Siyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao shrugged. "Do you still not understand? Each sperm from your body is powerful, smart, &nbsp;and practically perfect. They started their fighting the moment they left your body and they release chemicals to kill their opponents. But the problem is, each of them are so powerful that it's hard to kill each other. Therefore, they would release even more killing chemicals… And well, you can think of it as a chemical war. They enter the battlefield and all release the bombs at the same time, killing themselves in the end."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chemical war. This was quite a vivid comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were the strong and the weak “tadpoles”, normally. The strong beat up the weak, and elimination was easy. So, the strong tadpole would always be the one to reach its destination, fuse with the egg and evolve into a child. But in Xia Lei's case, the AE had not just evolved his body to an unbelievable degree, but his sperm too. Each individual tadpole had been that strong, that perfect, that their battle for the egg and been so exaggerated to the point that they all died on the “battlefield”.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You won’t have a problem if you only shoot one sperm at a time." Liang Siyao grinned mischievously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shoot only one at a time... Was there such a sharp-shooter in this world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What about artificial insemination?" Xia Lei suddenly thought of this idea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao shook her head. "That won't work. They're activated as soon as they leave your body and their battle starts then. They will kill each other even when they’re in the needle, and they will all die. The technology now isn't able to retrieve just a single sperm from your body either."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So you're saying that I'm perfectly fine, and it’s just that I can't prevent them from fighting, which results in me not being able to make a woman pregnant, right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. You're strong and intelligent, and your little tadpoles are strong and intelligent too. I almost laughed when I read that report. You look all fine on the outside but you can't make a woman pregnant. I couldn't help imagining what kind of child would be born if such a fine sperm were to make a woman pregnant too."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei rolled his eyes at Liang Siyao. "I'm so frustrated now, and you're joking with me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao gave Xia Lei a light punch. "Don't worry too much. I've thought about it, and you can change the way you shoot. Eject a bit first, and then a bit more. Maybe… you can have Shentu Tianyin change positions or something."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Stop it right there." Xia Lei’s face was red. "I get what's going on now, so let's not talk about that."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao's face was also flushed red. She looked at Xia Lei, her eyes full of emotion, and she hesitated before gathering her courage to say, "If Shentu Tianyin isn't willing, I am. I am willing to do anything for you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei's heart was a mess. Liang Siyao seemed to be working hard on reawakening his feelings for her, and she had actually succeeded a little. This feeling he had now was like an apple — a seductive apple which hid poison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao moved toward Xia Lei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei unconsciously took a step back. It was just one step, but that step put his back against the wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao continued moving towards him. Her breasts so close that they almost pressed to Xia Lei's chest. Her breath swept his face, hot, tickling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was at this crucial moment that a voice suddenly came from the examination room. "Huh? How did I fall asleep?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao stepped back abruptly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei got nervous too. "Leave, quick."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lei, promise me something. If the CIA were to target me one day, you need to help me,” said Liang Siyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What do you want me to help you with?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Talk to Long Bing and Shi Boren. I am willing to work for them," said Liang Siyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei smiled. He nodded gravely. "If something like that occurs, I'll definitely help you and welcome your return. It is China that is your home."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Siyao smiled, then turned and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her last line seem to be the real reason why she had risked returning to China.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old doctor walked over from his part of room after Liang Siyao left. He was confused and he muttered to himself, "Strange, so strange… How did I just fall asleep like that?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei lay back down on the operating table and pulled down his trousers to wait for his checkup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He already knew the truth but he still needed to go through the checkup process for Shentu Tianyin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten minutes later, Xia Lei walked out of the examination room. He saw Shentu Tianyin talking about something with a female doctor in the corridor. Fu Mingmei listened at her side, and her expression was weird. He walked over and listened to their conversation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Miss Shentu, there's no problem with you. You're perfectly normal and healthy. Your husband is also fine and healthy. Under normal circumstances, you two could have a child, but…" The female doctor trailed off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"But what?" Shentu Tianyin looked anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We're also unsure of the reason. Your husband's sperm is very strong and healthy. We've never seen such perfect sperm…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"My husband is healthy and I'm also healthy, so why can't we have children?" Shentu Tianyin looked as if she's fallen prey to some abnormal phenomenon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The female doctor spoke apologetically, "I'm very sorry Miss Shentu. Our medical devices are already the most advanced in the country, but we could not find any cause for infertility. My personal advice would be to go slow, and not rush it. Don't put too much stress on yourselves in the meantime. I know you're both busy people, and this could also be a reason why you're not yet pregnant."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thank you," Shentu Tianyin let out a breath of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Mingmei spotted Xia Lei and went up to him. "Son-in-law, what did that experienced professional say?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He said I'm perfectly normal, and I have no problems," said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin walked over and hugged Xia Lei all of a sudden. "I’m sorry, I…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei laughed and said, "Silly, why say sorry to me? You didn't do anything wrong."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No, I was too anxious. Things like this shouldn't be rushed. Let's go slow," said Shentu Tianyin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Nn, no hurry. We're still young and there are plenty of chances." Xia Lei could only comfort her like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Mingmei smiled and said, "I told you. A man as strong and healthy as Son-in-law, there's no way there'd be any problem. It must be the method that was the problem. Tell me, how did you guys do it? Tell me and I might be able to give you guys some good advice. I promise that it'll be effective."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shentu Tianyin swung a weak punch at her. "Go away! You don't even have a boyfriend, so what made you an expert?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Mingmei dodged and laughed as she said, "I was just influenced by Old Master. Just showing my concern. I've read a lot of relevant information and I did some research too. Really, you will get different results from different positions. You can be on top of Son-in-law sometimes, or in front, or sideways... Science! The science of love is very important."</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei slapped himself on his forehead. His heart felt like it was being trampled over by a thousand horses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What the hell was this?</span></p>
