 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was no surprise that Thunder Horse Military Factory had become the joke of this weapons exhibition. This joke was not known by many, however, because the people participating in the exhibition did not know where Thunder Horse Military Factory’s booth was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei seemed to have become reckless because of the hopeless situation. He did not put anything up and just brought a few people and some guns and ammunition to the exhibition booth. Thunder Horse Military Factory’s XL2500 sniper rifle and the newly-designed Gust assault rifle were put in large boxes and wheeled into the exhibition hall on a handcart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei got his people to open up the boxes when they got to the booth. They laid out plastic sheets and put the XL2500 sniper rifles and Gust assault rifles haphazardly on them. They put some up on the boxes themselves too, and that was it for the setting up of Thunder Horse Military Factory’s booth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This setup was just like putting out vegetables for sale at a wet market.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Director Xia, this won’t do,” said a young female employee. She volunteered to do something better. “How about we move two containers over to make a counter. We can also dress sexier and draw some eyes.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need.” Xia Lei shot down the employee's suggestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The female employee pursed her lips but didn’t say more. She’d been prepared to sacrifice herself to draw customers, but her boss's attitude was like this. She couldn’t say anything more. Let him be reckless!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Xiang, who had come over too, came up to Xia Lei and said in a soft voice, “That girl’s suggestion is not bad. This location is so lousy that no one is coming here. Who would know what we’re doing here? How about we let the customer service girls dress sexier and draw customers?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei laughed. “What are you guys so anxious about? Didn’t we bring a banner? Put it up.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Xiang shrugged. The banner Xia Lei was talking about was just a simple line of cloth with “Thunder Horse Military Factory” printed on it. What use was this plain banner going to be?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as the employees were wondering if Xia Lei had given up on this exhibition because he’d argued with Shentu Tianyin or something, Xia Lei gave his second set of instructions. He said to the female employee who had spoken up earlier, “Take two people with you. Give my name card to the overseas purchasers and the foreign reporters. If they ask you for details, say that we, Thunder Horse Military Factory, have manufactured the most advanced assault rifle in the world and it’s time for the European and American assault rifles to get pushed out of the playing field.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this… going to work?” The female employee was doubtful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why won’t it? It’ll work if you do as I say,” said Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The female employee walked off with two other female colleagues, each of them with carrying a prepared stack of name cards. They were on the hunt for overseas purchasers and reporters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Xiang looked at Xia Lei. “Will this work?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the same question but Xia Lei answered this time. “I defeated Barrett in Moscow, and bested FN and HK too. This is my basis. Our XL2500 is the best sniper rifle in the world. The European and American media may not admit it but they have taken note of the Thunder Horse name. I’m getting our employees to tell them and we have not just the world’s best sniper rifle but the world’s most advanced assault rifle. So, do you think they’ll come take a look?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Xiang understood then, and he chuckled. “Oh boy, that’s a good one. You’ve thought of this already, haven’t you? I have to give it to you – you made us worry for nothing.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was about to say that 'the eunuch worries more than the emperor' but he swallowed the joke when he remembered Qin Xiang’s ambiguity. He said, “Hanwu Weapons and China Industrial Group want to crush us but they forgot something. We have already achieved a high rating for ourselves in the international market. Hanwu Weapons and China Industrial Group look down on us but Barrett, HK and FN see us as their biggest rival. How can we, Thunder Horse Military Factory, be crushed by whomever who wishes us crushed?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their own domestic brethren looked down on them but the 'outsider white people' were treating them as close rivals. This was a bit of a tragedy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hanwu Weapons and China Industrial Group were working together to crush Thunder Horse Military Factory and they looked down on it, but Thunder Horse was a true dark horse in the international market!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thunder Horse was known internationally, and it now had the best sniper rifle and assault rifle under its roof – people would travel thousands of miles to come talk business with them, even if they were put in the middle of the Gobi desert! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Xiang quirked his lips in a smile and hit Xia Lei with a pale fist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei looked awkwardly at him. “What?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Xiang didn’t respond. He walked over to the exhibition area and told the girls to get to work. Xia Lei did not tell them to set up the booth, but Qin Xiang got the girls to take out the boxes of ammunition and make flower or fruit patterns with them. These patterns were made between the XL2500 sniper rifles and Gust assault rifles. The wooden crates were used too, and they became a rough-looking counter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good idea, Sister Xiang. It looks much better now,” said a female employee.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Xiang giggled. “Look lively, girls! Be warm and friendly when the customers come. Promote our guns.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, Sister Xiang.” The female employees were bubbly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, the girls who’d gone to give out name cards were back. It was just them, and no customers or guests. The three girls were sullen and smile-less.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s brows wrinkled. “What happened? Did you do as I told you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Director Xia, they’re such bullies!” said the team leader.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened? Tell me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A big group of Hanwu Weapons and China Industrial people kept a close watch on us. They stopped us from entering their areas to give out your name cards, and when they found out we were talking to foreigners they came over to interrupt. They didn’t even let us finish talking.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s more,” said another female employee. “Director Xia, they put signage to point people to the toilets at the other end. Some people walked in this direction but they went up to them and told them that the toilet here is broken and out of service.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it!” Qin Xiang exploded before Xia Lei could speak. “I’m going talk sense into them!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei stopped Qin Xiang. “It’s useless to talk sense into people with no sense. It’ll be like talking to pigs.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are we just going to let it be? I’m not going to take this lying down!” said Qin Xiang angrily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Ye Xiaoqi came walking over with some people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, isn’t this Thunder Horse Military Factory’s booth?” Ye Xiaoqi’s face was mocking. “Director Xia, why don’t you have any nice arrangements for your booth? Are you selling vegetables in the market?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Xiang was about to retort but Xia Lei pushed him behind himself, blocking him off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s Ye Kun who told you to come mock us, wasn’t it?” said Xia Lei softly. “Why didn’t he come himself?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Our Chairman Ye specially instructed me to come over and check on your situation here, to see if you’ll need any help. You guys got notified only last night, after all, and had no time to set up your booth. Look, our Chairman Ye is so kind, but you keep wanting to go against him. What’s the use of doing that?” Ye Xiaoqi spoke breezily as she eyed the Gust assault rifle in Thunder Horse Military Factory’s booth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her gaze betrayed her aim in coming here. Ye Kun got her to come to see if Thunder Horse Military Factory had put the Gust assault rifle on display.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve seen how it is. We don’t need anyone’s help. You can go back to Ye Kun and tell him that,” said Xia Lei evenly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Humph!” Ye Xiaoqi’s attitude took a sudden change. “Director Xia, your Gust assault rifle looks exactly the same as our Shenwu assault rifle! What’s going on here?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei pretended not to have heard her clearly. “What did you say?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xiaoqi sneered, “Acting dumb? You know full well what I said. Just you wait, you’re in big trouble!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you saying? Who’s acting dumb?” Qin Xiang poked his head out from behind Xia Lei. He put a hand on his hip and pointed at Ye Xiaoqi, his stance was that of one who was ready to fight.</span></p>

Who’s this?” said Ye Xiaoqi said scathingly. “Xia Lei, this can’t be your squeeze, can it? Speaking up for you so passionately… Does Shentu Tianyin know about this?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei abruptly walked up to Ye Xiaoqi and raised his hand to slap her.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people behind her were no simple folk either.
