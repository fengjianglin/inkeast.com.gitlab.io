 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few Mercedes-Benz G-class military-use off-road vehicles cleared the way for a long convoy of the CIA’s Chevrolet Suburban off-road cars. They went along the road by the coast, in the direction of the airport.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Valhalla Box Town shrank gradually in the distance. Oil-green forest lined both sides of the road, and Lucerne flowers bloomed on the nearby meadows. The multi-colored Lucerne flowers seemed to weave themselves into a carpet of flowers, so beautiful that it would be a waste to blink.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Would he ever see such beautiful scenery again?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei was heavy-hearted. He’d thought that Sean would stab an anaesthetic into him with a needle, and wouldn’t bind his hands and legs, but Sean didn’t do that. Instead, he had had his hands and legs bound together with iron chains which were usually used on the worst of criminals. Xia Lei’s plan to pretend to be knocked out by the anaesthetic, then ambush them and escape became useless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Sean was one of the most difficult opponents from the CIA which Xia Lei had met.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell me, Mr Xia, you went to Afghanistan, then to Jerusalem, and then Japan. We believe you were on some sort of mission. What is this mission?” probed Sean. He stared at Xia Lei. They were in a Chevrolet Suburban in the middle of the convoy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Holiday. Pick up girls,” said Xia Lei flatly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean frowned. “Mr Xia, I am being polite. You’d better be polite too. You know my methods well; there is no need for you to anger me and let yourself suffer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei smiled. “You saw, didn’t you? My two girlfriends are very beautiful. I took one of them when I went to Afghanistan and I took the two of them when I went to Jerusalem. When I went to Japan, I took the other one. My mission is to make them happy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean suddenly punched Xia Lei’s cheek.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s head was knocked violently to one side, almost smashing into the car window. A small line of blood spilled from the corner of his lips, but he laughed. “Is that all you got? You’d better not end up in my hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean sneered. “Heh, you think you can escape? Let me tell you this — you will be sent to Nevada’s Area 51 military base. An entire army &nbsp;wouldn’t be able to save you, even if they attacked the place, much less you escaping on your own.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">America’s Area 51, the legendary base which studied aliens. It was also the base where America conducted her secret weapons research and experiments. That place was very mysterious. None of the countries’ spy organisations were able to obtain information on Area 51, even to this day. If Xia Lei were truly to be sent to that place, he would have no way of escaping.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The AE Research Center is in Area 51?” Xia Lei probed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you like that place?” Sean’s response was like a confirmation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I do. I have been wanting to see what it’s like and I finally have a chance to do so now,” said Xia Lei with a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehehe…” Sean laughed. “You took what should have belonged to America. The AE capsules. We are quite certain that you have superhuman capabilities. You will become a subject of research. AE’s secret, and the technology related to AE all belong to America. I really admire your character, but I wonder if you can still laugh once you’re lying on the ice-cold operating table, dissected for research like a frog or little white mouse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha!” Xia Lei laughed, but his laughter was filled with bitterness and helplessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right then, in one of the seconds of Xia Lei’s laugh, came the sound of a violent explosion from up ahead. The shock wave of the explosion shook the ground, making the roads tremble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flames shot towards the sky, and bullet-proof glass shattered. The car shook and went off course. The car had been travelling normally just one second earlier, but everything was in chaos in the next second.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s head smashed into the car door. In that instant, he saw a Mercedes-Benz G-class military-use off-road vehicle flying through the air. It was on fire. The people in the car were on fire too. The fire danced splendidly in the sky, like some sort of top-notch special effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM! A Mercedes-Benz G-class military-use off-road vehicle which was blasted into the air by a roadside bomb, and it fell back to the ground, slamming into another military-use Mercedes-Benz driven by the German Special Forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Enemy attack!” Someone yelled angrily in German.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, bang...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The German Special Forces gunners fired at the hill on the right. The unique heavy metallic thunder of a heavy-duty machine guns thumped in their hearts. Flames, bouncing shells, bullets falling like rain — the forest on that side of the hill were torn to shreds. A person hiding in there would be done for, and even a tree would be thoroughly ripped to pieces!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the German Special Forces soldiers’ suppressive fire had only lasted for less than ten seconds when a bullet lodged into the forehead of a German Special Forces machine gunner. The bullet had come from nowhere. His head was torn open, and his skull, brain matter, and blood were all mixed together as they splattered through the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some militant appeared on the hill. They wore black combat gear, and had black headgear. The weapons in their hands were very advanced, on par with what the German Special Forces soldiers had. They made use of the trees and rocks on the hill, to rush down. They were quick, and moved well together; they were the picture of elite combat skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are they, damn it? Who are they!” roared Sean in the car.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean had no idea who these militants who suddenly appeared were, but Xia Lei knew. He had already spotted the sniper in the forest who had shot the German Special Forces machine gunner in the forehead. It was none other than Dark Mona, who he had fought against in Oshino Hakkai!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The FA Organisation was making their move.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean had not expected something like this to happen, and even Xia Lei had not expected it either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was quite logical for the FA Organization to make a move now, because once the CIA brought Xia Lei to Area 51, even a national army wouldn’t be able to breach it, much less the FA Organisation. Whether it was for the interests of the AE Research Center, representing the Americans, or Dark Mona, who represented the FA Organization, their target was him. The CIA was taking him to Area 51 now, so the FA Organization obviously wasn’t going to just sit and do nothing. Doing so would not benefit them at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now was the last chance for the FA Organisation to steal him away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei watched with his left eye. Dark Mona stood, gun in hand, and shot. Every shot she fired meant the death of a German Special Forces soldier or a CIA agent. There was not a single trace of emotion on her face. She was indifferent, ice. However, what shocked Xia Lei was not her gun or her marksmanship, but the cigar she held in one corner of her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Killing people while smoking a cigar — what sort of woman was she?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean screamed into the walkie-talkie, “Call for reinforcements! Call…” He suddenly paused mid-scream, then dashed the walkie-talkie violently onto the car door.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no signal. This was the FA Organization’s usual method. It was the blitzkrieg strategy, and there was no calling for reinforcements in a battle with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another German Special Forces soldier who just climbed onto the Mercedes-Benz G-class military-use off-road vehicle was shot by Dark Mona. No one dared to take over the machine gunner’s position again. Go, and you die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Retreat! Turn around, retreat!” Sean roared at the driver.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A heavy truck suddenly appeared from behind, and its driver twisted the steering wheel, causing the body of the truck to block the road horizontally.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The road behind them had also been cut off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean suddenly pointed a gun at Xia Lei’s head. “Get out of the car! Quickly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’d just finished talking, when...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM! Another violent explosion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Chevrolet Suburban off-road vehicle in front of them was struck by a rocket. The vehicle turned to scrap immediately, and the CIA agents who had been using the car as a shield were blasted away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The shockwave of the explosion went straight to the Chevrolet Suburban which Xia Lei was in. His body was lifted by the impact, and thrown on top of Sean. And in that very moment, Xia Lei reached into Sean’s clothing and grabbed the key which could unlock his chains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thieving techniques he had learnt from Qin Xiang now became a skill for self-preservation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok, ok. I will get off.” Xia Lei reached over and grabbed the car door, pushing it open.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean’s hand came out of the car door. He kept the gun pointed at Xia Lei’s head as he moved, and got ready to get out of the car.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s legs landed on the ground. He abruptly moved his head to the side, and slammed his back against the car door.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean’s hand was crushed in the car door.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei did a snatch, and immediately got hold of Sean’s gun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The CIA agent in the driver’s seat burst out of the car and fired at Xia Lei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei rolled, dodging the bullets flying at him. He stuck out his arm at the same time, and fired. The bullet hit the driver between his eyebrows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sean wanted to chase after Xia Lei but he dared not, not after seeing Xia Lei kill his subordinate right after he got free. He threw himself flat against the backseat of the car, and didn’t even dare to show his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei’s continued rolling, heading towards the meadow by the road. He held the gun he had grabbed from Sean’s hand tight, and the key he had stolen from him. These two items concerned his freedom, life, and whether he would be able to escape in the next half an hour!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle raged on.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A free agent of the FA Organisation with a mini multi-barrel machine gun on his back appeared suddenly, shooting at the defensive line formed by the CIA agents and the German Special Forces soldiers. The appearance of the mini multi-barrel machine gun immediately upset the balance between the two sides. The dense concentration of 7.62mm bullets dropping like rain was invincible. Wherever the muzzle of the gun pointed, ruin happened, and even the Mercedes-Benz G-class military-use off-road vehicles were torn apart, much less a human body. A human body would be shredded right away!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who had the time to care about Xia Lei at this time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Lei stopped rolling, and he sat with his legs crossed. He used the key and unlocked the iron chains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ding! A string of sparks suddenly spluttered from the iron chains. A sniper rifle bullet had zoomed between the narrow gap of the iron chains and went into Xia Lei’s thigh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t need to look to know that Dark Mona had fired that shot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark Mona had not brought the FA Organisation’s free agents here due to any good intentions. Her and Sean’s aim were the same. She would not give him a chance to escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sniper rifle bullet buried itself in the flesh of Xia Lei’s thigh. The scorching hot bullet brought him an indescribable pain. Xia Lei clenched his teeth and tugged the unlocked iron chains off, then rolled towards the dense underbrush.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, the iron chain had absorbed some of the bullet’s impact, or the sniper bullet would have crippled his left leg!&nbsp;</span></p>
