Instead, she spoke in a low tone, “You weren’t there when we sent the Heavenly Smiting Devil Emperor off at the border of the Primal Chaos so you probably don’t know who truly forced the darkness out of Yun Che and pushed him into such desperate straits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao, “...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was the Dragon Monarch.” Qianye Ying’er’s gaze turned gloomy as she continued on, “Zhou Xuzi had blasted the Evil Infant out of the Primal Chaos right before the crimson rift was sealed. Yun Che was furious with Zhou Xuzi, but the Southern Sea God Emperor and Qianye Fantian opposed him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even so, that alone would not have driven Yun Che to desperation. After all, Yun Che had just saved the universe and everyone owed him their lives. The exalted and esteemed Dragon Monarch had also always held Yun Che in high regards and he had even wanted to take him as his foster son back when they first met. It was also the Dragon God Realm who took Yun Che in and saved him when he was under my Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All he had to do was stand up and speak for Yun Che, and everything would have been resolved.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, not only did the Dragon Monarch not speak up for Yun Che, he reproached him instead. He pressured everyone who was present at the time and he pressed Yun Che in a manner that was even more merciless than the Southern Sea God Emperor and Qianye Fantian.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since the Dragon Monarch, their leader and the number one god emperor of the three divine regions, had chosen to stand against Yun Che, the rest of the god emperors and realm kings had no choice but to take his side. In his fury, Yun Che touched the Eternal Calamity imprint left to him by the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor. Devilish energy gushed from his body, which immediately gave everyone a proper reason to kill him, forcing him into dire straits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er’s golden brows froze, “I was very puzzled by the Dragon Monarch’s change in attitude toward Yun Che and it remained a mystery to me for the longest time. I believe that everyone who knew of the Dragon Monarch’s admiration for Yun Che would also be puzzled by his behavior back then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Chi Wuyao frowned deeply but she remained silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She truly had not been present when Yun Che’s darkness had been exposed at the border of the Primal Chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one who had dealt a fatal blow to Mu Xuanyin had also been the Dragon Monarch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that she thought about it, the viciousness of the Dragon Monarch’s attack directly contradicted his personality. Especially since he was said to be someone who was proud and aloof, who did not deign to involve himself in the petty squabbles of the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, once I arrived in the Northern Divine Region, Yun Che accidentally divulged a secret to me,” Qianye Ying’er said. “He slept with the Dragon Queen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...!” Chi Wuyao’s eyebrows twitched violently, “What did you say!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This man, who is worse than any beast, is capable of anything,” Qianye Ying’er spat out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shock paralyzed her mind for an instant, but Chi Wuyao frowned as she suddenly recalled the frivolous question she had asked Yun Che during their meeting with the Eternal Heaven God Emperor. During the time that Yun Che had allowed his soul to be seized, Chi Wuyao had taken the opportunity to ask him this question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, who do you think is the most beautiful woman that you’ve ever come across?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s reply was “Shen Xi”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She hadn’t paid much attention to it back then and she had even teased him about it. After all, the “Dragon Queen and Goddess” stood at the pinnacle of beauty in this current era. Furthermore, it was not strange for him to have seen the Dragon Queen’s true appearance after she had agreed to let him stay in the Forbidden Land of Samsara, so his answer was even less surprising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That… beast!” Chi Wuyao’s ample chest heaved enchantingly. “He even dared to taint a married woman! A married woman who also happened to be the Dragon Monarch’s wife! The Dragon Queen whom he is greatly indebted to!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was greatly shocked and a little disappointed too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No,” Qianye Ying’er replied in a soft voice. “I’m afraid this matter isn’t as simple as that. Because Yun Che emphasized this point to me repeatedly, and he’s even gotten angry over it many times.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She is Shen Xi, not the Dragon Queen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Chi Wuyao frowned deeply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even though Yun Che’s lechery is ingrained in his bones and he’s a true scoundrel, he is also excessively loyal to his friends.” Qianye Ying’er “praised” him with an expressionless face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Back then, he was indebted to the Dragon Monarch so if Shen Xi was truly the Dragon Monarch’s wife, he definitely wouldn’t have touched her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Xi’s heavenly beauty could break down any man’s willpower in an instant, it would instantly cause that person to toss any notion of friendship or ethics out the window… However, Qianye Ying’er was convinced that the insanely lecherous Yun Che would not be swayed by this and her belief was not without any basis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because when she had been Yun Che’s slave, he had not touched her at all for Xia Qingyue and Jasmine’s sake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Which would also mean…” Chi Wuyao muttered to herself, “Shen Xi is not the Dragon Queen. Perhaps those words… really are true.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her understanding of Yun Che’s nature far surpassed Qianye Ying’er’s. Indeed, if it was the wife of someone he was indebted to, he would never touch her, no matter what. There was also no way he’d be able to stay so calm when someone mentioned “Shen Xi”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er said, “At first, all I cared about was mocking Shen Xi for being a slut who was pretentiously pure on the outside but lewd and wanton on the inside. But after I angered him so many times, a very amusing possibility began to form in my head…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Perhaps, this so-called ‘Dragon Queen’ had never even existed. Instead, this title was only a ridiculous charade the Dragon Monarch used to trick the rest of the world, and even more so, himself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao’s gaze turned ice-cold. She did not find this shocking or ridiculous at all. Instead, she was calculating what sort of dangers lay hidden in their path… if all of these things were true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And you’ve never verified these things with Yun Che before?” Chi Wuyao asked carefully.</span></p>

The Western and Southern Divine Regions had no reason to interfere with the Northern Divine Region’s vengeance.

She let out a soft sigh and said, “I hope that all of these things are just baseless conjecture.
