Since Yun Che had already said that he wouldn’t kill or cripple Jin Yue, she knew that he wouldn’t go back on his word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Jin Yue’s face had lost all of its color. She couldn’t speak or even struggle, and her eyes grew dimmer with each passing second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s eyes were ice-cold as darkness seeped out of his hand and began to spread from Jin Yue’s neck to her solar plexus and lower abdomen. The darkness swiftly pooled in those two locations before forming a dark sigil about the size of a grown man’s palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he stared at the dark mark that he had left on her body, he coldly said, “Are you filled with shame right now? Then let that shame carve itself into your very soul, so that you’ll never ever forget this moment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His family had died… so how could he simply let these people off just like that!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he loosened his grip on Jin Yue’s neck and casually pushed her aside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Yue fell heavily on the ground and immediately curled up into a fetal position. She panickedly conjured up a layer of moonlight to cover up the jade body that had been defiled by devilish power, but she would never be able to hide the shame that had been carved into her very soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Listen up, you’d better leave this black sigil exactly where I put it. Don’t ever think of trying to get rid of it. If I ever sense its existence disappearing… I will come back and annihilate your entire clan!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che hadn’t only used his darkness profound energy to create this black sigil, he had also used a bit of his soul power. Therefore, he would be able to sense Jin Yue’s location as long as the mark remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, this also meant that she would always be under Yun Che’s watchful eye and she could forget about ever taking any rash actions against him… Even though she had never once thought of doing anything against Yun Che in the first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is already the greatest forgiveness and grace that I can give you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As a casual aside, I’ll bestow upon you one more piece of advice. You should forget about ever getting a man in this lifetime, because if they see this dark sigil that I have personally blessed you with… Tsk!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Shui Meiyin stood behind Yun Che, she sensed that dark malice flaring up from him once more. Her delicate head drooped as she quietly bit down hard on her lower lip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cough… cough cough…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Yue gingerly held her snowy neck as she was seized by a fit of violent coughing, but she didn’t say a single word after that. Her other hand was quietly planted on a piece of dirt behind her. She was holding something very small in her hand… and she was holding onto it very tightly, as if she was terrified that Yun Che would see it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately for her, Yun Che had already caught sight of it the moment it fell from her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a very small bronze mirror that couldn’t be any more ordinary. Xia Qingyue had once worn it around her neck because it was something that Yue Wugou had left to her. Back then, Yun Che had been so curious about it that he had even asked her about it, and he had even opened it once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A profound image was engraved in that bronze mirror. In the picture was a young Xia Hongyi, and Xia Yuanba, and Xia Qingyue when they were only three and four years old respectively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why is this bronze mirror with you?” Yun Che asked with slightly narrowed eyes. He had asked the question in a very casual manner, and it was clear that he didn’t really care what the answer was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A divine profound practitioner normally carried their important items in a spatial ring or in their own personal spatial pocket, but Jin Yue had actually been wearing this bronze mirror. It was clear to see that she still possessed a deep reverence… and affection for Xia Qingyue even in spite of her cruel banishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin Yue’s entire body instantly went rigid. She gripped the bronze mirror even tighter, but she did not dare to answer that question. In the end, she replied in a soft and tremulous voice, “Master… tasked me with destroying it… I was afraid that Master might regret it one day, so I secretly kept it without telling her…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, it was the only thing she had to remember Xia Qingyue by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then you should keep it properly, and I hope that that woman’s possessions won't bring you too much misfortune in the future,” Yun Che said in a derisive voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you still doing here?” Shui Meiyin said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once she knew that Yun Che wouldn’t try to seize or destroy the bronze mirror in her hand, the stiffness went out of Jin Yue’s body. She slowly got to her feet and changed into another set of blue robes before she picked up the unconscious Wei’er and swiftly flew off into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she left, her eyes did not contain any hatred or shame. Instead, they were filled with a dispirited brokenness and a quiet sorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being able to serve Xia Qingyue would always be the greatest pride and joy of her life. However, she had also suffered this great humiliation because she had once served Xia Qingyue… What was even more complicated was that this great humiliation was practically a boon that the Goddess Meiyin had managed to secure on her behalf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she flew through the night sky, drops of heart-rending starlight fell from her beautiful eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She did not know whether the events of today would be a form of release or the beginning of a neverending nightmare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that Yun Che was done with his business, he let out a small sigh. When he turned around, his eyes had become warm and gentle once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother Yun Che, thank you,” Shui Meiyin said in a soft and gentle voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che shook his head and said, “Then, in regards to what you wanted to tell me today… Have you thought things through?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I have,” Shui Meiyin said as she vigorously nodded her head. After that, she laughed and said, “I’ve decided that I will tell you after we’ve beaten the Dragon God Realm. However, I can tell you this right now. It’s something wonderful… In fact, it should be a very happy surprise for you.”</span></p>

The muscular young man’s body was covered with wounds and his power was being completely suppressed by both of his opponents.

A huge force slammed into his body, causing blood to gush out of his mouth, but he didn’t retreat a single inch. Unfortunately for him, the attacks didn’t end there, as another huge force shot forward and slammed straight into his abdomen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The muscular man gave a low groan as he flew across the ground, tumbling many times before finally coming to a stop.</span></p>

He actually dares to scold us?” the Seven Star Realm profound practitioner on the left scoffed as he arched one of his eyebrows sardonically.

As such, anyone who believes in, is willing to submit to, or is related in any way to the Devil Master of the North… is someone we have to kill!
