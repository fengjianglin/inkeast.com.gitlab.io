Spirit abruptly returned to Yun Che’s eyes as the Golden Crow Divine Soul and Ice Phoenix Divine Soul broke out of their forced slumber in unison. The infinitely vast space of his soul world began glowing with brilliant gold and blue once more...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… y-y-you…”</span></p>

This meant that she was born with a sense of superiority and nobility that came naturally to her. That was why she could act and smile confidently before the strongest experts of the Eastern Divine Region unlike other young profound practitioners.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the young girl sounded absolutely panicked right now. Not a bit of calmness was left in her voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she had a special soul that allowed her to look down on all living things, she was a completely blank paper when it came to her “experience” in the ways of men and women. In this regard, she was at least ten thousand Shui Yingyues behind Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even more treacherous were the scenes Yun Che had specifically chosen to recall. Anyone, be it Shui Meiyin’s mother or a prostitute who had countless sexual experiences in their lives, would’ve turned red with embarrassment if they were in Shui Meiyin’s position, much less a pure fifteen year old young girl! Even better, Shui Meiyin’s consciousness was inside Yun Che’s soul space right now, which meant that she had a near perfect “view” and “sensation” of his dirty thoughts...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One might say that it was a huge blow to her soul to say the least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Shui Meiyin’s soul energy crumbled on its own, Yun Che instantly counterattacked and dispelled the layers of pressure in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… you… how could you… you… you bad person!!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm? What are you saying? What did I do?” Yun Che replied innocently, “I was just recalling scenes of me and my wives… loving each other, that’s all. Is there anything wrong with that? Ah? Oh no, don’t tell me you peeped on those memories too? You’re not one of those bad girls, are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Meiyin’s soul was practically shaking after Yun Che had blasphemed her soul, and then dumped the blame on her. “You… you… you are the bad person! You are a bad person! Y-you… I’m telling my sister about this… Nn… I’m really angry now!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Meiyin forced herself to concentrate and stopped her soul energy from collapsing in just a short time, filling Yun Che’s entire soul space with tremendous pressure once more. This time though, a delicate figure slowly appeared before Yun Che. It was none other than Shui Meiyin herself… somehow, she was able to manifest herself in Yun Che’s soul space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sea of black butterflies flew behind her, filling up more than half of Yun Che’s soul space. Although the dancing insects looked ephemerally beautiful and enigmatic, Yun Che actually felt like the sky was about to collapse on him. His heart and soul froze for just an instant. The pressure was so powerful, so terrible, that Yun Che was almost certain that his consciousness would be completely crushed if it was allowed to fall on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Obviously, Shui Meiyin had gotten angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had never been blasphemed in her life, much less in such a shameless and intimate way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Black butterflies filled the sky. The ice phoenix and golden crow’s soul images quickly turned pale and colorless once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Meiyin’s soul energy definitely far exceeded his expectations. He had always been confident in his mental strength, but the reality was that Shui Meiyin had wiped the floor with him, especially when she had started going all out. Even struggling had become a near impossibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If she was this powerful at this age… he literally couldn’t imagine what she might become in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately for Shui Meiyin, she was just too young. Yun Che knew her greatest weakness now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che didn’t put up any resistance despite facing the full power and fury of Shui Meiyin. Just as the young girl cried out, and the black butterflies shone black, the instant the soul energy came crashing down on Yun Che, a girl suddenly appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was a young girl wearing a black dress with black butterflies sewn to her slender waist. She had pupils as dark as the night, the countenance of an angel, and a purity that was comparable to that to a spirit. It was none other than Shui Meiyin herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl was standing there doing nothing, when a Yun Che suddenly appeared out of nowhere and pushed her down on the ground. He then tore apart her clothes mercilessly, and revealed a delicate and pitiable snow white body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire soul space shuddered, and the skyful of black butterflies suddenly froze in their tracks. The real Shui Meiyin’s pupils instantly widened. “Ah… you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was just about to shout angrily at Yun Che when her voice suddenly died. Then, a scream several times longer and more frightened than the one before burst out of her throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that scene, Yun Che had lifted her all too delicate body into the air, locked her in an incredibly embarrassing position and rammed his waist straight against hers… before she could recover from her shock, Yun Che had turned her around into an even more embarrassing pose before ravishing her from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah… Ah… Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young girl’s cries filled every corner of the soul world. The glowing black butterflies fell into confusion before they started crumbling in droves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only was Yun Che’s method shameless beyond compare, the timing of his execution was also incredibly treacherous… He had chosen the exact moment Shui Meiyin unleashed her full power to play the scene in his head. As a result, Shui Meiyin’s soul attack hadn’t just crumbled, it had backlashed harshly against her soul too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Yun Che summoned all of his soul energy and threw it against her. The Golden Crow and Ice Phoenix divine souls exploded at the same time and filled the entire soul space with fire and ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Meiyin had lost control completely, and Yun Che had seized the opportunity to counter attack with his full power. As a result, Yun Che successfully overturned what should’ve been a completely one-sided victory, as Shui Meiyin’s soul figure turned blurry due to the backlash, before vanishing entirely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the Conferred God Stage, Yun Che suddenly opened his eyes and unleashed his profound energy. He pounced towards Shui Meiyin like a meteor and trapped her inside profound energy right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The consequence of a soul rebound was far worse than a profound energy rebound of the same level. If the rebound was severe, it might even deal irreversible damage to a one’s soul. Therefore, Shui Meiyin had no way to accumulate profound energy while her soul was in chaos. By the time she let out her scream and fell heavily on her butt, Yun Che had already completely sealed her in profound energy from head to toe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked like Yun Che had suppressed Shui Meiyin with profound energy easily, but in reality he was letting out a long sigh of relief in his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The abrupt change caught everyone off guard. Loud exclamations kept bursting from the spectator stands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Shui Yingyue shot to her feet immediately. Disbelief was clearly etched on her face.</span></p>

It was because a forceful soul probe was bound to cause interference to both parties’ souls, and since this was the Conferred God Battle such an action was absolutely not allowed.</span></p>

They only knew that Yun Che had unleashed both the Golden Crow Divine Soul and Ice Phoenix Divine Soul at the same time, although they sensed nothing from Shui Meiyin because her soul energy was absolutely untraceable.</span></p>

A bright pink color had crawled all the way from her perfect countenance down to her neck. Somehow, the blend of color and expression granted her a seductive, irresistible quality that could thrum the heartstrings and blood of every man. It was a charm that absolutely shouldn’t belong to someone her age.</span></p>

Please don’t get mad okay.”</span></p>

It was to the point where he began withdrawing his profound energy from Shui Meiyin without realizing it.</span></p>

Yun Che hadn’t just blasphemed her soul in the soul space, he had practically raped her right before her own eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Shui Meiyin bit her lips as water threatened to drown her eyes completely.

As she got up and flew into the air, the two tear droplets finally broke free from her eyes and landed soundlessly on the Conferred God Stage and Yun Che’s heart and soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che, “...”</span></p>

She just flew far away into the distance.</span></p>

Beside him, Shui Yingyue’s had already taken off in a blue light and chased after Shui Meiyin. Before she left, Yun Che could clearly sense her steely gaze drilling into his body. It was immediately followed by everyone else in the Glazed Light Realm’s seating area, including the Glazed Light Realm King himself.</span></p>

She was the beloved daughter of the Glazed Light Realm King, an unprecedented genius in the entire history of the Eastern Divine Region, and an unparalleled proud daughter of the heavens that the Eternal Heaven Realm King himself had tried to recruit as a disciple… then was rejected by.</span></p>

If she told the truth… he had already offended the Holy Eaves Realm earlier in order to vent his frustrations. If he had to deal with the Glazed Light Realm too then he might as well run away from the Eastern Divine Region this second!</span></p>

The end result of Meng Duanxi and Jun Xilei’s battle surprised no one, but Yun Che and Shui Meiyin’s battle was definitely a shocker. Shui Meiyin’s abnormal reactions also made them certain that something strange had happened while they were doing battle in the soul world.</span></p>

Shui Meiyin’s soul energy is shockingly powerful, and I was nearly defeated by her. However, thanks to her ‘inexperience’, I was barely able to beat her using a ‘little trick’. I… think she got angry because of it.”</span></p>

However, his voice obviously lacked strength when he told her his answer. Whatever he did, it obviously wasn’t just a ‘little trick’.</span></p>

You… You’re just too amazing! Top four! You’re now one of the Conferred God Children, a new member of the Four God Children of the Eastern Divine Region!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Yun Che had defeated Shui Meiyin, the Four God Children of the Conferred God Battle were born.

However, Yun Che had joined their ranks by replacing Lu Lengchuan. Since he had joined them by defeating one of their members on the Conferred God Stage, where countless profound practitioners of the Eastern Divine Region had borne witness, his new status was acknowledged and solidified faster than expected.</span></p>

Technically speaking, the gap between his power and the three God Children’s power was like heaven and earth. However, Yun Che had undoubted created miracle after miracle on the Conferred God Stage again and again, turning everyone’s common sense upside down and defeating opponents that should’ve been impossible for him to defeat. At this point, no one could question his right. On the contrary, the moment he was officially recognized as a member of the Four God Children, he was cheered by everyone from the stands and even those watching through the star tablets. The shouts among those of lower star realms and middle star realms were especially loud.</span></p>

The shock and sensation Yun Che stirred on the Conferred God Stage far exceeded any one of the three God Children.</span></p>

The four great king realms would give each of them a special reward as well. However, no one knew what this special reward would be just yet.</span></p>

For example, Eternal Heaven Realm would decide between Shui Meiyin and Meng Duanxi who was fifth or sixth place according to their overall strength and performance. The same went for Lu Lengchuan, Huo Poyun, and the others as well.</span></p>

Although he ultimately managed to beat Lu Lengchuan, it was a hard won victory. But Jun Xilei was far stronger than Lu Lengchuan.</span></p>
