They all kneeled in front of Yun Che, one after the other…. They kneeled in front of the darkness they had once hated and despised. They kowtowed, broke their own teeth, and were marked with that dark mark, and they even had to thank Yun Che profusely for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The profound practitioners in the Eastern Divine Region were so shocked and horrified by what they saw that their bodies went numb. They weren't quite sure whether the emotion which currently filled their hearts was self-mockery or sorrow.</span></p>

That was the way of the world, but it had never been done in such a naked and cruel manner before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che watched as each and every one of these higher realm kings kneeled before him and broke their own teeth. His face was cold and impassive and not a single trace of pity or unwillingness could be seen on his face… However, no traces of joy could be seen either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the same group of people, but now their attitudes and expressions were completely different.</span></p>

The good thing was that the entire sect went into lockdown as quickly as possible, so the news did not spread. Otherwise, the number one star realm in the Eastern Divine Region would have become the biggest laughingstock of the Eastern Divine Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Holy Eaves Great Elder walked into the hall with a somber expression on his face. He said, “Sect Master, we can no longer afford to let Yun Che wait any longer. Even if we have to sacrifice all of our dignity and honor, we can, at the very least… preserve the foundations that our forebears laid down for us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four great king realms had fallen one after the other, so what room did their Holy Eaves Realm have to be proud and aloof?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s more, they had just been rocked by such a huge change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Holy Eaves Realm King Luo Shangchen slowly raised his head to look at the Great Elder. In just the short span of a few days, he seemed to have aged several millennia. “Have we found… that bastard?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Holy Eaves Great Elder shook his head. He did not speak. In fact, he could not bring himself to say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the events of that day, Luo Changsheng had rushed out of the Holy Eaves Realm and all communication with him had been lost. Luo Guxie injured a whole bunch of Holy Eaves disciples and rushed after him and her whereabouts were also unknown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a matter of mere moments, the Holy Eaves Realm had lost two late stage Divine Masters. Even worse than that, they had lost their successor, whose light had been so brilliant that it illuminated the world. As for Luo Shangchen, how could this be the only thing that had affected him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Retribution? He could not accept that. In fact, he didn’t even think that he had done anything wrong back then. After all, he had only killed a peasant from a lower star realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he slowly got to his feet, a small shudder went through his entire body before he even managed to stand up straight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go,” he said with a sigh as he stared at the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s right, we don’t have any other choice… Just like we didn’t have a choice back at the borders of the Primal Chaos all those years ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master.” The Holy Eaves Great Elder hesitated for a moment before he decided to say what was on his mind. “Pardon this question. If we find Changsheng, how is Sect Master… going to deal with him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Shangchen’s face was impassive as he said, “We will cripple him and lock him up inside a prison forever.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Holy Eaves Great Elder was shocked by those words. “But…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Or do you think that I should let a bastard like him inherit the Holy Eaves Realm!?” Luo Shangchen grew agitated, his aura flaring up in a terrifyingly chaotic manner. “If we leave him be, he’ll certainly take my seat in the future. No one in his generation can compare to him in terms of cultivation or fame…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stretched a quivering finger toward the Holy Eaves Great Elder. “Even you cannot bear to harm him! So when the time comes, who will be able to stop him!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please calm your anger Sect Master. I have no such intentions,” the Holy Eaves Great Elder said. As he looked at Luo Shangchen’s appearance, he gave a very heavy sigh in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Can’t bear to? Who is the one who truly couldn’t bear to...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Feihong replied, “The Dragon God Realm has consistently said that the Dragon Monarch is in seclusion and that he won’t be coming out of it anytime soon. However, now that the Eternal Heaven God Realm, Moon God Realm, and Brahma Monarch God Realm have been defeated one after the other, there’s no way that the Dragon God Realm can afford to ignore the situation any longer. Even if the Dragon Monarch really can’t come out, they will surely take action soon.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand.” Nan Feihong gave a heavy nod of his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Wansheng slowly closed his eyes before he suddenly spoke in a deep voice. “It’s really strange. Given the attitude the Dragon Monarch showed back then, he clearly hates Yun Che for some reason unknown to us. But now that Yun Che has invaded the Eastern Divine Region with the Northern Divine Region, it just so happens to be when the Dragon Monarch entered into ‘seclusion’? Surely this is too ‘coincidental’.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, this was the Dragon Monarch, the monarch who reigned above the five god emperors of the Western Divine Region, the absolute ruler of the Dragon God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they had been invaded, the Dragon Monarch would naturally retaliate with all of their might.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Dragon Monarch… What in the world could cause someone as powerful as him to “disappear” for such a long time?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This rang especially true for him as he had personally witnessed the grand Brahma Monarch God Realm, the Eastern Divine Region’s strongest king realm that could be mentioned in the same breath as his Southern Sea King Realm, get transformed into a living hell within the span of a single day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If anyone had seen what he had seen, there was no doubt that it would leave an incomparably deep shadow in the depths of their hearts and souls. This was the same for him, the number one god emperor in the Southern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have no choice but to worry about this now,” Nan Wansheng said grimly. “It is very likely that the Northern Divine Region will come for the Southern Divine Region next.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This…” Nan Feihong was shocked by those words but he quickly recovered. “I don’t think they will. The reason why the Eastern Divine Region was trampled by the Northern Divine Region was because they made light of their enemy at first and later started falling to sneak attacks. The same thing won’t happen in our Southern Divine Region.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, they must have lost a lot of people in this invasion of the Eastern Divine Region, and their strength has been sapped. Even if they really do plan to attack our Southern Divine Region, they will have to rest and recuperate for a long time before that. Besides, Yun Che possesses a deep and abiding hatred for the Eastern Divine Region, but he hasn’t really had many entanglements with our Southern Divine Region…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh!” Nan Wansheng interrupted him with a cold chuckle. “Could it be that you’re forgetting who exactly drove the Heavenly Slaughter Star God into a dead end all those years ago?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Feihong’s gaze grew sharp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yun Che has already become a complete and utter maniac! A maniac who only lives for revenge!” Nan Wansheng said in a dark voice. “Power and hegemony? The status of an emperor? &nbsp;He doesn’t give a whit about those things, so why would he weigh the pros and cons of a battle between divine regions!? Everything that has happened has been part of his insane vengeance!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Behind this lunatic lies the schemes and cunning of the Devil Queen herself! She’s the real brains of the operation and she’s been helping Yun Che gobble up the Eastern Divine Region bit by bit. So this invasion of theirs isn’t just for them to vent their hatred and anger, they’ve also managed to make up for most of their losses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In addition to this… the Dragon Monarch’s absence has created a window of time that is extremely precious to them, why would they waste even a second of it!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every word that Nan Wansheng spoke caused his heart to grow heavier. “It’s very likely that they won’t cease their invasion after they have conquered the Eastern Divine Region. They won’t bother to rest and reorganize either… In fact, they might even come knocking on our doorstep sooner than I had expected!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Northern Hell King pinched his eyebrows together. “Could the Northern Divine Region really think that it can swallow up our Southern Divine Region in the same way it swallowed up the Eastern Divine Region?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, would you have believed that Yun Che could take command of the Northern Divine Region and wash the Eastern Divine Region in a sea of blood four years ago?” Nan Wansheng coldly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Northern Hell Sea King was instantly rendered speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yun Che definitely isn’t someone you can use logic to explain. This was also the biggest reason why everyone desperately wanted to kill him back then. The consequences of failing to kill him… Well, they’re now plain for you to see, aren’t they?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Wansheng’s hands were slowly tightening into fists.</span></p>

At the very least, the methods they used to defeat the Moon God Realm and the Brahma Monarch God Realm should not be available to them anymore. Otherwise, there is no reason for them to not have used the same methods to destroy the Eternal Heaven God Realm and reduce their losses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since that’s the case, why don’t we try to take the initiative?” A strange light flashed in his eyes. “More than a decade has passed and Qianqiu has nearly finished perfectly merging with his divine power. Since his appointment as crown prince is only a matter of time, why not do it now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Wansheng raised his head and said, “You mean...?”</span></p>

This includes Yun Che and the king realms led by the Dragon God Realm. At that time, we will be able to directly discern Yun Che’s attitude toward the Southern Divine Region.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If he is willing to face us openly and honestly, that will mean that he has no intention of provoking our Southern Divine Region in the near future. If that’s the case, we can afford to wait for the Dragon Monarch to return. If he chooses to marshal the entire Western Divine Region to attack Yun Che and his forces, the Northern Divine Region will surely crumble. If that happens, our Southern Divine Region won’t even need to risk a single strand of hair on our heads.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If he behaves arrogantly or rejects our invitation,” the Northern Hell Sea King said as a cold light flashed in his eyes, “then we will have no choice but to be the first to strike.
