In truth, they found her scheme childish and laughable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A puff of air escaped from the White Rainbow Dragon God’s nostrils. He was just about to launch into a mocking tirade when he felt his entire body go cold and his breath catch in his throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All eight of the Dragon Gods immediately turned to look at the Dragon Monarch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His face had turned dark and grim and his entire body was radiating an extremely shocking rage that he was trying his best to suppress… Furthermore, it wasn’t just a flash of rage, it was a rage that had been burning for some time now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was the Dragon Monarch, the only monarch in the God Realm, the most exalted and unparalleled existence in the entire Primal Chaos. He was the strongest in terms of profound strength and raw power, he had the most exalted and revered status, had lived for hundreds of thousands of years, and had the wisdom and temperament to match them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if all the mountains of the universe collapsed, even if the entire world was burning around him, his emotions would remain calm and unfrazzled. Even if he faced self-confident fools or mockers, it wouldn’t cause a single ripple in his heart. All of this was nothing more than a childish joke born of ignorance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So to say that the Dragon Monarch was not qualified to fight someone? To anyone else, to almost everyone that was present, there wasn’t a more forced, stupid, and pathetic insult in the world than this. It was an insult so woeful that it didn’t even have the qualifications to cause even a single hair on the Dragon Monarch’s brow to twitch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...!!??” The eyes of all the Dragon Gods, Dragon Sovereigns, Master Dragons, and god emperors kept looking toward the Dragon Monarch’s hands and face over and over again, and looks of shock and disbelief slowly crept up their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“??” Even the five great Venerable Withered Dragons had started to frown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the supreme Dragon Monarch, how could he be so easily enraged by such a pathetic insult?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Rainbow Dragon God stared at the Dragon Monarch dumbfoundedly for a few breaths before he finally came back to himself. The lazy insult that he had been about to hurl had now been transformed into a furious rebuke. “What a joke! Why would our Dragon God Realm be scared of a mere Devil Master!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Chi Wuyao shot him a sidelong glance. “Just as expected, it wasn’t only the Dragon Monarch. Even his Dragon Gods are a bunch of fake hypocrites who have the gall to do the deed but not admit to it. As they say, birds of a feather flock together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You didn’t even hesitate to use the World Dragon City to rush over here, just so that you could catch us when the Devil Master was away… So why do you insist on putting up such a front? Can’t you see that it’s so obvious and ridiculous?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh heh heh!” The White Rainbow Dragon God let out a disdainful laugh. “Devil Queen, I’m afraid that you have forgotten that your so-called Devil Master, Yun Che, would have died in some wasteland if our Dragon Queen hadn’t decided to save him out of the great kindness of her heart! So where do you find the gall to say what…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">CRACK!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This thunderous cracking sound was so loud that it made everyone think that the Dragon Monarch had broken his own finger bones by clenching his fists too hard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Rainbow Dragon God’s voice broke off abruptly as his body suddenly turned cold. He felt so cold that his entire body was shuddering and he couldn’t even find the wherewithal to continue his speech.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, this cold intent, one which penetrated straight to his dragon soul, was actually coming from the Dragon Monarch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Azure Dragon God stepped forward and kicked the back of the White Rainbow Dragon God’s calf… He was the only one among all the Dragon Gods who had managed to vaguely figure out something during this period of time. However, the Dragon Monarch had told him not to breathe a word to anyone, so how would he even dare to say anything?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Rainbow Dragon God turned to look at him with a face filled with puzzled shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cang Shitian’s wild laughter rang through the air, and it matched his recently self-conferred title “mad dog”. This time, his laughter was exceptionally wild and bold. “What a joke! Who is the Devil Master? He is the person who inherited the Heretic God’s legacy before receiving the inheritance of a Devil Emperor. He is the person that the Sky Poison Pearl acknowledged as its master… This is a Creation God, Devil Emperor, and a Profound Heavenly Treasure we are talking about here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“His profound strength is only at the level of a Divine Sovereign, but his devilish might can already be compared to a god emperor’s strength! And he is barely over thirty years of age! Who exactly in this world can compare to him? Who would even deign to do so? The Dragon Monarch? Hahahahahaha! In front of the Devil Master, he is nothing more than an old worm who has lived for three hundred and fifty thousand years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anger had started to simmer on the faces of everyone from the Dragon God Realm, but the Dragon Monarch’s current emotional state was so strange that none of them dared to act impulsively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cang Shitian continued, “Speaking of which, everyone in the God Realm is aware of the two great beauties whose names have dominated the universe. The two celestial pearls of our world, the Dragon Queen and Goddess. The Goddess has already become the Devil Master’s exclusive property, and the Dragon Queen… Heh, if the Devil Master had been born hundreds of thousands of years ago, do you think that you would even have gotten your turn, Dragon Monarch!? I’m afraid that she’d rather be the Devil Master’s concubine before she would even spare you a single glance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BAAAANG————</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dozens of kilometers of space violently swelled up with the Dragon Monarch at its center and it looked like it was about to burst.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Venerable Withered Dragons, Dragon Gods, and Dragon Sovereigns were all knocked backward by the blast of energy that had erupted from the Dragon Monarch’s body. All of them immediately turned to look at him and they were frozen in place by what they saw.</span></p>

But after that, it was time for his own eyes to widen dramatically as his lips twitched and he started to laugh like a madman. “Heh… Hehehehehe… Hahahaha… Ha… Hahahahahahahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those words had merely been a message that Chi Wuyao had sent to him via sound transmission.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cang Shitian’s wild laughter was simply far too grating. Long Yi gave a short sigh of disappointment before saying, “Dragon Monarch, do not lose your dignity.”</span></p>

Divine light that resembled the scorching rays of a heavenly sun shone from his eyes. “Where is Yun Che?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words were calm and his emotions were inscrutable.</span></p>

He was simply too far away, so he will need at least another ten to twelve hours to rush back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s why I have to say that your plan to avoid our lord Devil Master was very successful.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph.”</span></p>

Even though Long Bai’s voice had been calm and dry, it sent a chill coursing through his heart and soul. “Do you think that a mere Devil Queen is capable of bewitching me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Crimson Destruction Dragon God’s body became as tense as a bowstring as he anxiously replied, “No!

Since they think that I am afraid of their so-called Devil Master, then I will wait for him to crawl out of his hole!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Dragon Monarch is right!” The Myriad Manifestation God Emperor reacted the quickest and his voice chimed out in agreement. “These dark wretches are merely dark wretches in the end. Even if we have to wait twelve hundred hours rather than twelve hours, what will they be able to accomplish?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right,” the Chi Dragon Emperor said. “Let’s use these twelve hours to shatter the last bit of pride and dignity that they have. How can we allow a bunch of filthy devils to sully the name of the Dragon God Realm!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that two god emperors had agreed, no one else dared to say anything in the face of the Dragon Monarch’s frightening aura.</span></p>

What if my lord Devil Master skins you like a snake after he returns? Won’t that be even more shameful and undignified? By the time that happens, it will be far too late to regret this decision.”</span></p>
