His body went cold as his head jerked up to look at Chi Wuyao. He desperately suppressed the chaos in his heart as he said in a low voice, “You hijacked… her soul?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao shook her head gently, “I did think of doing that in the past. But for some odd reason, I gave up on that option in the end and I merely chose to ‘attach’ myself to her soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s trembling eyes gradually grew focused as he spoke in a low voice, “As expected…. Just as expected… No, that’s not right! When did you infiltrate the Snow Song Realm!? What exactly did you do to her!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s reaction was completely within Chi Wuyao’s expectations. She let out a long and languid sigh as she replied slowly, “I will tell you everything. I will also reveal… all of myself to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che: “...”</span></p>

She began speaking in that soft devilish voice of hers again, “Yun Qianying should have told you that I previously lured Qianye Fantian and Zhou Xuzi to the borders of the Northern Divine Region ten millennia ago and engaged in a fierce battle with them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To the god emperors of the Eastern Divine Region, the Yama Emperor, and the Burning Moon God Emperor, the reason I tested my strength against the two strongest god emperors of the Eastern Divine Region was to show off my ambition after my coronation as emperor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But in reality, and this is something that only I know, I had a very special goal to accomplish during that battle. I had planned to lure them into the Northern Divine Region and borrow the darkness energy within this place to secretly perform a successful soul infiltration.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qianye Ying’er had first mentioned the Devil Queen to Yun Che, she had told him about what had happened ten thousand years ago. At that time, as she faced off against the two strongest god emperors of the Eastern Divine Region along with the strongest Guardian and Brahma God, Chi Wuyao had been soundly defeated and she had fled back into the Northern Divine Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Fantian, Qianye Wubei, Zhou Xuzi, and Honorable Tai Yu had ventured into the Northern Divine Region as they wanted to take advantage of Chi Wuyao’s defeat to bury her forever. But they had been lured in and assaulted by the devilish energy Chi Wuyao had gathered from thousands of kilometers around them. The dark energy had gnawed at their minds and souls, leaving behind a dark shadow in the hearts of the two strongest god emperors of the east, a shadow that refused to fade even after ten thousand years had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like Chi Wuyao had said, Qianye Ying’er had told him that Chi Wuyao was clearly testing the Eastern Divine Region’s strength during that battle. At the same time, she had exposed her enormous ambition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ambition to break out of the Northern Divine Region was also precisely the reason why Qianye Ying’er had tried her best to get Yun Che to ally himself with the Devil Queen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, Chi Wuyao was telling him something else altogether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Brahma Heaven God Emperor, the Eternal Heaven God Emperor, a Brahma God, and a Guardian… They were the most important existences in the Eastern Divine Region, so they definitely had access to the most important power and secrets of the Eastern Divine Region and even the other two divine regions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I could use my Devil Emperor divine soul to secretly attach my soul to one of these people, I could observe the true state of the three divine regions with my own two eyes and also discover many other important secrets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But alas, I had underestimated the strength of the Brahma Monarch God Realm and the Eternal Heaven God Realm. Though I managed to lure them into the borders of the Northern Divine Region, I still couldn’t find the right opportunity. I tried to force it a few times, but all my attempts failed. I had no choice but to settle for the next best thing and grab someone who had entered the battle by accident.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was a woman who was holding an ice sword in her hand. Icy cold frost energy radiated from her body and her eyes were so cold that it looked like they could freeze one’s soul. She had just entered the Divine Master Realm yet she had clearly underestimated the scope of this battle and her chosen opponent. She, who had forced her way into this battle, was easily subdued by me. After that, I took her to the Northern Divine Region with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s brows violently twitched.</span></p>

She was Mu Xuanyin, the new realm king of the Snow Song Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s eyes trembled once more, but he forced himself to remain silent as he focused attentively on every word that rang in his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Snow Song Realm was the closest star realm in the Eastern Divine Region to the Northern Divine Region so they would constantly encounter dark profound practitioners who had escaped the Northern Divine Region in despair. These are the people that the Eastern Divine Region call ‘devils’. As the leader of the Snow Song Realm, many people from the bloodline of their realm king died at the hands of Northern Divine Region profound practitioners. This includes their ancestor and many of her close relatives… As a result, she also harbored a deep hatred towards the Northern Divine Region.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che slowly tightened both his hands into fists.

If I forcefully seized her soul, the process would definitely rouse the slumbering will within it and it might very well trigger a counterattack that I would not be able to account for. Thus, I chose to attach my soul to hers in the end… I attached ten percent of my Devil Emperor soul to Mu Xuanyin’s soul.”</span></p>

She had even voiced her doubts when Yun Che had asked her about Mu Xuanyin’s split personality… She had not been pretending back then. She had truly been unaware of Chi Wuyao’s existence within Mu Xuanyin for the last ten millennia.</span></p>

Yun Che could already imagine what had happened next. She only needed to release Mu Xuanyin in a very natural manner. After that, Mu Xuanyin would return to the Snow Song Realm once she woke up, but she would be completely unaware of the fact that a passenger was riding shotgun in her soul—an incredibly terrifying Devil Emperor soul that she had no way of ever detecting.</span></p>

The person he had come to know, respect, and love. The person who had walked into the deepest parts of his heart and soul. The person who had disappeared from his life forever. That person had not been Mu Xuanyin, it had been the combined personalities of Mu Xuanyin and Chi Wuyao.</span></p>

Even if it’s a Devil Emperor’s soul, attaching one soul’s to another person is ultimately exactly what it sounds like. I was unable to independently control her body. Nor was I able to change her decisions. The only advantage I had was that I never had to worry about being discovered by her.”</span></p>

She viewed my existence as a second personality that had formed in her mind. She rejected me at first but she eventually learned to accept me and in the end, she even started to enjoy having me around and she would even pass the reins over to me when she felt like it… So she could enjoy that sort of uninhibited and unbridled release.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, I had merely attached myself to her soul at the end of the day. When it did not compromise her principles, she would listen to the decisions that I, her ‘other personality’, made. But when she made up her mind, no matter how hard I tried to interfere as her ‘second personality’, I wasn’t truly able to obstruct her from doing what she wanted.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even though your master was not purely Mu Xuanyin, she was still the master of her own mind and body. In the end, her will and her personality were dominant.”</span></p>

It forced me to come to terms with something. If it was based on my power alone, changing the fate of the Northern Divine Region would be nothing more than a foolish pipedream.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But when I was just about to remove the attached part of my devil soul from her own, you appeared. The Heretic God aura that rolled off you caught my attention the very first moment you stepped into the Divine Ice Phoenix Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And so, I gave her a few gentle nudges and she (I) met you, she (I) took you as her disciple, she (I) became very curious about the Heretic God divine power and the Dragon God divine soul that you possessed, so her (my) interest in you… grew deeper and deeper. She (I) started falling into a dangerous abyss before she (I) even knew it.”</span></p>

She didn’t sense it and I did not stop it. In fact, I was powerless to stop it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, the interference that came from the Ice Phoenix divine being was actually not necessary in the first place.”</span></p>

Her heart and mental state underwent a colossal change. When she had been unable to track you down after you had run away, that was the most worried and confused she had been for the last ten millennia. I, myself, am deeply aware of why she became so confused.”</span></p>

Someone who was even her direct disciple.</span></p>
