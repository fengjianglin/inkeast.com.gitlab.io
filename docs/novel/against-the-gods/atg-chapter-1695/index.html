Even the explanation she had given him after that had been incredibly strange and mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was no wonder she almost seemed to be able to read his mind.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As it turned out, she had already appeared in his life ten years ago. She had always been observing him and teaching him from the years he had spent in the Snow Song Realm… up until the day his heart and soul were broken at the Blue Pole Star.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You possessed far too many secrets.” Chi Wuyao continued, “When a woman wants to dig up a man’s secrets, she normally ends up sinking into an abyss before she can even notice. Even she (I) was no exception.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This was especially true for her (me) after the events that occured within the Ancient God Burying Inferno Prison… Even she (I) had completely given in to despair, yet you used your strength, wits and even your own life to rescue her (me).”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You had not only stolen her body, you had also stolen her heart… For a woman who had sealed her emotions in ice for the last ten millennia, for a woman who could not fall in love, the moment she did fall in love, it would be something that would last beyond even death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che: “...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was also after that moment that she would regularly use my ‘personality’ to face you. In fact, she had become far more willing than ever before to use that ‘personality’. Perhaps, she subconsciously thought that my ‘personality’ would be able to draw you to her more, would be able to make you fall head over heels for her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However…” Chi Wuyao briefly paused as her voice became tinged with a deep melancholy. “Right before she met her untimely end outside the Blue Pole Star, as her soul was slipping into death, she finally learned of my existence in the few instants it took for my devil soul to leave her body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s vision spun violently as the world grew blurry. The sounds and the images which pierced his heart and cut his soul clearly played out in front of him yet again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are not the only one… who gets to act selfishly…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Che’er, live… on…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body started to violently shake as a wave of sorrow that was far too intense for him to handle overtook him. He lifted his head to look at Chi Wuyao, who was still veiled in black mist. His gaze was frightening and his voice was low and deep. “What the hell… did you take her for…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Phoenix divine being had inserted her divine soul into Mu Xuanyin so that she could see the outside world through Mu Xuanyin’s eyes. It was only when Yun Che had appeared that she interfered with Mu Xuanyin’s will for the first and last time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That had already stirred up Yun Che’s wrath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if getting rid of that suggestion meant that Mu Xuanyin’s doting love for him might turn into hatred, he still insisted that the Ice Phoenix divine being do it. Because it was much too cruel and unfair… for Mu Xuanyin, for anyone at all in fact, to have their own mind and will tampered with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Chi Wuyao… Although she had only attached her soul to Mu Xuanyin and could not forcefully interfere with her, she had subtly influenced Mu Xuanyin for nearly her entire life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This also meant that Mu Xuanyin had been used and manipulated by other people for nearly her entire life and she never had a clue about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What the hell do all of you take her for…” Yun Che muttered under his breath, his fingers curling into tight fists as they trembled. “Why did each and every one of you… have to treat her this way!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pain, self-recrimination, and rage that were too intense for him to bear chaotically surged through his heart and Yun Che’s vision swam. He instantly closed the gap between him and Chi Wuyao as his arm suddenly shot out violently. His fingers pierced the black mist as they shot toward her throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao did not move and allowed him to grab her violently by the throat, his fingers painfully digging into her flesh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also in this instant that Chi Wuyao’s black mist slowly started to scatter… For the first time ever, Yun Che beheld Chi Wuyao’s true appearance through blurry eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soul Stealing Realm’s Devil Queen, Chi Wuyao. She was the most beautiful woman in the Northern Divine Region. That was something that every living creature in the Northern Divine Region knew and no one had ever doubted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the black mist blew away, an alluringly beautiful face that seemed to hold all of the bewitching seductiveness in the world appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just based on the exquisiteness of her physical features, she would already be considered a peerless beauty in the God Realm. Her beauty was just a step lower than Shen Xi and Qianye Ying’er’s beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, her crescent brows and phoenix eyes effortlessly released a boundless bewitching allure that threatened to yank a person’s soul out of their body. Her exquisite lips were pink and dewy. A single small glance from her would penetrate a man’s soul and topple his will, causing his body to burn up with boundless desire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his eyes swept downward, he saw that she was wearing an unadorned black robe which wrapped around her, showing off her ample chest and every bewitching curve of her body. She quietly stood there, her breasts gently rising and falling from simply breathing, creating a sight that was so seductive and mesmerizing that Yun Che’s veins almost popped open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also in that moment that Yun Che blurrily realized what the words “devilish figure” truly meant for the first time in his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che had seen many seductive and alluring women and he was familiar with more than a few arts of seduction. But he had never known that a woman could actually be this alluring and mesmerizing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every inch of her body… even her snowy skin, even the jade neck that he was gripping with his hand, seemed to glow with a fantastically mesmerizing light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s entire body was frozen in place as he dumbly stared at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The incredibly intense pain, sorrow, and rage that he had clearly felt an instant ago had vanished into thin air. It was as if all of these emotions had been sucked into the boundless abyss of her spellbinding magnetism.</span></p>
