 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the Holy Eaves Realm turned toward Luo Changsheng. Their eyes remained fixed on him as they confirmed his clear and all-too familiar life energy again and again. After checking the aura of his profound energy and soul as well, all of them were left with one conclusion, and that was “this person is definitely our sect’s pride and joy, Luo Changsheng”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Holy Eaves Great Elder was frozen in place. His gaze darted between Luo Changsheng, Luo Shangchen, and Luo Guxie without stopping and he was at a complete loss as to what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon seeing Luo Changsheng’s clearly abnormal state, Luo Guxie’s expression changed. The sinister coldness and imperious might that was radiating from her body became far less intense and some confusion and panic crept into her aura. “Changsheng, this has nothing to do with you. Leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master.” When he uttered that word, his eyes remained fixed on Luo Guxie. This was his master, his aunt, the person he had held in the highest esteem. “Tell me that none of this is real… That none of this is real…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Guxie felt her breath catch in her throat… Besides the time he had lost to Yun Che on top of the Conferred God Stage, she had never seen Luo Changsheng’s eyes look so confused before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, he was still young. But after he had been through those three thousand years in the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm, he had become far wiser than he had been back then… So the only possible reason for his current state was that he had also found out about the truth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ptooey!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Guxie had not known how to answer Luo Changsheng’s question, but Luo Shangchen had responded in her stead. His furious voice was filled with hatred and killing intent and it trembled as he pointed a finger at Luo Changsheng. “You… dog bastard! You’ve conspired together with this bitch to hoodwink me all these years… but you’re still acting dumb!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that Luo Changsheng was the son that Luo Shangchen loved and appreciated the most. He was the apple of his eye, the one thing he was most proud of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, when they personally heard him call Luo Changsheng a “dog bastard”, all of the residents of the Holy Eaves Realm who were within earshot felt as if they had been beaten over the head with a heavy rod. They were all completely stunned and shaken by those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng’s body swayed as his face turned a sickly white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two words “dog bastard” fiercely plucked at the strings of Luo Guxie’s soul as they dug deeply into the painful memories that she never wanted to recall again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her head violently swiveled as she stared daggers at Luo Shangchen. Now that the painful memories of yesteryear were being pried open, the complex emotions and guilt that had welled up in her heart completely dissipated. The only thing left was a deep feeling of hatred and determination. “Luo Shangchen, didn’t you keep asking me what happened to your ‘Changsheng’ just now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She started laughing and her laughter was extremely cold and sinister. “How ridiculous! How utterly ridiculous! Since when did you ever have a ‘Changsheng’? ‘Changsheng’ is a name that I chose, his life is something that I brought into this world, his cultivation was personally guided by me. From his head to his toes, from beginning to the end, he never had anything to do with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for that pathetic and pitiful son of yours, he went to accompany that pitiful mother of his a long time ago. I mean… How could I allow him to live!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Guxie’s words exploded like deafening thunder in everyone’s ears, causing shock to instantly appear on countless faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Luo Shangchen had already deduced that this was the only possible conclusion, when he heard Luo Guxie utter those words, the blood vessels in his eyes nearly exploded. “You bitch… YOU BITCH!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he roared those words, his body shot toward Luo Guxie. A towering tidal wave of energy sucked up all of the debris in the area as it surged toward Luo Guxie in a frenzy… and the dazed Luo Changsheng was also in its blast radius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Guxie gave Luo Changsheng a shove and the moment she did that, the energy wave collapsed and the earth cracked apart. In the end, Luo Shangchen’s cultivation could not rival Luo Guxie’s and he was blasted backwards by her blow. However, the killing intent radiating from his body had not dissipated in the slightest. His face had turned as red as blood and it was as if all the blood in his body had rushed to his head in his extreme fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahahaha, hahahaha!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Guxie started to laugh as Luo Shangchen raged. Her face twisted as she wildly laughed without restraint. Her eyes were filled with contempt and delight as she crowed, “This is karma! This is the karma that you and that old dog reaped! This is the karma that the Holy Eaves Realm reaped!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Shangchen’s eyes nearly burst out of their sockets, he was painfully aware of who she was referring to when she uttered the words “that old dog”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their father, the previous Holy Eaves Realm King, Luo Lingtian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, she had viciously cursed at Luo Lingtian before leaving the Holy Eaves Realm. She had vowed to never return and she had only come back after Luo Lingtian had died, when Luo Changsheng had been born.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, only her body had come back to the Holy Eaves Realm. Her heart still remained closed to them and she had not allowed Luo Shangchen to re-enter her name into the family rolls. Luo Shangchen always thought that the venomous oath that she swore all those years ago and that unerasable mark of shame were the reasons for her insistence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only today that he knew...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be that everything that you’ve done is actually for… is actually for the sake of…” Luo Shangchen’s eyes had practically burst from their sockets as he glared at Luo Guxie. His aura was in such chaos and confusion that it was hard for him to even speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ning Danqing, do you still remember this name?” Luo Guxie’s voice grew solemn as a deep pain crossed her warped face. A miserable laugh escaped her throat. “No, you definitely wouldn’t be able to remember it. After all, you held yourself in such high regard that the only people you deemed worthy were realm kings and god emperors! So how is it possible that you would remember his name!? Even when you killed him all those years ago, it was an act that was beneath your dignity, something that would dirty your hands!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Luo Guxie uttered the name “Ning Danqing”, the expressions on all of the Holy Eaves elders’ faces dramatically changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Guxie had sworn a venomous oath when she left the Holy Eaves Realm all those years ago… and the Holy Eaves Realm had sealed away the true reason for her departure. No one had dared to even mention it, but the ones who had lived through that time would never forget it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Guxie was the blessed daughter bestowed to the Holy Eaves Realm by the heavens. She showed a startlingly high talent in the profound way ever since she was a child and the entire sect viewed her as a precious treasure. In fact, their expectations for her even exceeded that of Luo Shangchen, who was then the young master of the sect.</span></p>

As her older brother, Luo Shangchen would also never allow Luo Guxie to lower her dignity and marry that “peasant”. If news of this matter were to spread, it would undoubtedly tarnish the Holy Eaves Realm’s reputation and turn them into the laughingstock of the other realms.</span></p>

She was so lost in her infatuation that she turned a deaf ear to the commands of her father and brother and repeatedly visited that lower star realm to meet with Ning Danqing, it was as if she was possessed.</span></p>

He flew into a great rage and ordered Luo Shangchen to personally go to that lower star realm and kill Ning Danqing. He also ordered Luo Shangchen to bring back his head… to forever extinguish Luo Guxie’s foolish thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Luo Guxie’s reaction upon seeing her lover’s head was far more violent than anyone in the Holy Eaves Realm had ever dreamed of. It was as if she had gone mad. She viciously cursed Luo Lingtian and Luo Shangchen and even attacked them in her rage… In the end, she fled seriously wounded. As she left the Holy Eaves Realm, she swore an oath that was so venomous that it sent chills down the spine of anyone who heard it. After that, she disappeared for the next few millennia.</span></p>

Over the last few years, he had tried his best to repair his relationship with her and her doting love for Luo Changsheng had been the thing that had comforted him the most over the last few decades.</span></p>

After leaving this filthy Holy Eaves Realm, I tried every method I could to stop the baby’s growth and seal him in my womb. Eventually I succeeded. After that, I started cultivating and accumulating strength at all costs… There was nothing I wouldn’t do to obtain power.”</span></p>

She spoke in a soft and soothing voice, “Changsheng, do you know why I gave you the name ‘Changsheng’? Because your father… your real father, drew a painting of longevity for you the moment he found out that I was pregnant with you This is the name that your father gave to you.”</span></p>

A painting scroll appeared in that hand and it was sealed in a gentle-looking profound light. It looked like it was from a bygone era but not a single mark could be seen on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When that gentle white light entered Luo Changsheng’s eyes, it seemed oh so glaring to him.
