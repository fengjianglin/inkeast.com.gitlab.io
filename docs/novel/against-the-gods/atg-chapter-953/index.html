 <p><b>Chapter 953 - Impossible Result</b></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Ice Profound Realm, Yun Che, who had eliminated the first Winterfrost Direwolf did not relax in the slightest after having killed it. Instead, he waited for another enemy to appear. But after a good while, his surroundings were still silent. Right when he began to have doubts, a dangerous aura finally appeared once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, two streaks of blue light appeared before him at the same time, projecting the silhouettes of two Winterfrost Direwolves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was slightly stunned but his nerves and body had already reacted at the very first instant, thunderously dashing at the Winterfrost Direwolf up ahead. Just as it appeared, before it even had time to see its surroundings, the Winterfrost Direwolf had been punched in the head by Yun Che amidst a violent explosion of Golden Crow flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aooo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Winterfrost Direwolf let out a wretched cry and was flung away, its entire body covered in flames. At the same time, a dangerous aura suddenly closed in from Yun Che’s rear. Not having enough time to turn around, Yun Che instead rolled on the ground, sliding over lightning quick. When the Winterfrost Direwolf behind him pounced on him, his hand ferociously shot upward with a chop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to their dangerous, bloodthirsty aura, these Winterfrost Direwolves were a bit “weak.” Upon receiving Yun Che’s chop, the second Winterfrost Direwolf’s right hind leg was immediately snapped apart and fell to the ground amidst its miserable shrieking. Yun Che’s body quickly came to a stop before throwing himself forward. Just as he was about to take that chance to deal a heavy blow to its vitals, an icy wind attack suddenly blew over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first Winterfrost Direwolf that he had blasted away using Golden Crow flames was filled with burn injuries and a savage excitement. It howled as it pounced at Yun Che’s back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yun Che’s brows sunk. His hand posture immediately changed. He grabbed the broken hind leg of the Winterfrost Direwolf before him and turned around, smashing it behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Yun Che executed a simple swing, it had several hundred kilograms worth of power. The two Winterfrost Direwolves heavily collided, bringing the bloom of two bloody flowers. Following the miserable howl of the two Winterfrost Direwolves as they flew away, a terrifying rain of blood began to fall in the Ice Profound Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yun Che stretched out both of his hands. At the same time the two Winterfrost Direwolves landed on the ground, several blasts of Golden Crow flames were released in succession.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom boom boom boom boom boom...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The continuous flame explosions which contained the Golden Crow’s flame power momentarily dispersed the Winterfrost Direwolves’ cold energy. Once he stopped his assault, the two Winterfrost Direwolves had already stopped their shrieks and quickly dissipated within the flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Phew… it’s pretty easy.” Yun Che let out a breath of air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that there are only these kinds of ice wolves in the Ice Profound Realm? Or will stronger profound beasts appear… Yun Che couldn’t help wondering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After eliminating those two Winterfrost Direwolves as soon as they appeared, he had to wait quite a while yet again before a dangerous aura approached.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, three streaks of blue light flashed at the same time. What appeared were three Winterfrost Direwolves with bloodthirsty auras.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing the three Winterfrost Direwolves appear at the same exact time, not only did Yun Che not get nervous, his expression had even relaxed somewhat. The first wave had one, the second wave had two and the third wave had three and they all appeared at around the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant that this test most likely spawned Winterfrost Direwolves at set intervals and the next wave would have one more Winterfrost Direwolf.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He also had a rough understanding of a Winterfrost Direwolf’s strength and threat. Added to the fact that they appeared in the same exact intervals, this was enough for Yun Che to believe that being able to hold on for fifteen minutes here wasn’t that hard of a task.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The test here couldn’t even be said in the same breath as the trial in the Dragon God’s secret realm where the enemies doubled every wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three sinister bone-chilling violent auras firmly locked onto Yun Che. Right when all three Winterfrost Direwolves were about to attack, a huge blaze had already erupted from Yun Che’s body. Beneath the firelight, the Winterfrost Direwolves’ bloody pupils contracted as they suddenly fell back, even letting out sinister hissing sounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yun Che had just discovered that Winterfrost Direwolves feared fire. As ice type profound beasts, being afraid of fire couldn’t be any more ordinary. Fire and ice originally suppressed one another… but for Yun Che, it had clearly become a one sided restraint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the Winterfrost Direwolves were backing away, Yun Che made the first move and violent firelight once more exploded within the Ice Profound Realm...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The examination profound formation echoed once more and the second profound practitioner was ejected. Mu Xiaolan subconsciously went forward but quickly noticed that it was still not Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As time passed, more and more examinees died within the Ice Profound Realm and were immediately ejected. The speed in which the examinees were ejected became even quicker the later it was. There were sometimes where a dozen or so people were ejected within several breaths of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The states in which they were ejected from the Ice Profound Realm were all especially similar. Their faces were all deathly white and they all possessed frightened expressions and sweated due to debility. However, the moment they woke up from within death’s shadow, they realized that they hadn’t actually been torn apart. Not even a scar or bruise was on their bodies but what greeted them was another cruel fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and leave using that profound formation, losers! Stop taking up the space here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Hanfeng’s said rather coldly with narrowed eyes, “Our Ice Phoenix Divine Sect never takes pity on losers, nor will we waste any more attention on them! Hurry up and leave, I don’t have the patience to say it a second time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being the first nine hundred profound practitioners to die in the Ice Profound Realm meant that they had failed the final test. This also meant that their dreams of joining Freezing Snow Hall had become an illusion. The faces of the losers turned ashen but none dared to disobey Ji Hanfeng’s order as they all left dragging heavy footsteps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right, in this cruel and competitive God Realm, no one would take pity on trash or losers, nor would anyone bother to look at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Weird, how come that brat named Yun Che isn’t out yet? Ji Hanfeng muttered in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It… it’s not him again? Ah? So strange, more than six hundred people have come out already, why hasn’t he come out yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>More and more people were being ejected out of the Ice Profound Realm yet Yun Che, the one who should’ve been the first one to fail due to his profound strength being the weakest still had not appeared. The Snowstorm Realm test could be “cheated” through but the Ice Profound Realm was a “projection.” It was an genuine strength assessment which was impossible to be cheated on in any shape or form… It was fundamentally impossible to withstand a single blow from a Winterfrost Direwolf with profound strength at the fifth level of the Sovereign Profond Realm, so how could he possibly persevere until now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Hanfeng was indefinitely bewildered, Mu Xiaolan was stupefied and the expression of Mu Sushan, who had been spectating through the entire process continuously fluctuated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the final exam progressed, more and more examinees were being ejected from the Ice Profound Realm. In the end, following the sound of the profound formation, the nine hundredth examinee was ejected out amidst a terrible scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clang!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The profound formation’s light suddenly began to violently fluctuate at this time as its deep blue light became a luminous white.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nine hundredth and first examinee was ejected out of the profound formation but the difference was that this examinee’s body was surrounded by a layer of white light, its color the same as the profound formation. This white light was proof that he had successfully passed the Ice Profound Realm trial… which also mean that he had passed Freezing Snow Hall’s final examination and was qualified to become a disciple of Freezing Snow Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw the white light on his body, that profound practitioner instantly forgot the terror of his death. In his excitement, he shook his arms and shouted wildly. After him, more and more examinees were consecutively ejected. Every one of them wore the white light, which proved that they had successively passed the exam, on their bodies. At this moment, those who were still in the Ice Profound Realm had all passed the exam. The final competition was now seeing who was able to obtain the title of number one and obtain the “Jadefallen Ice Soul Pellet” which was like a sacred treasure in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Mu Xiaolan still did not see Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on here?” Ji Hanfeng paced back and forth, his brows pressed together. The first examinee to get ejected not being Yun Che was already enough to shock him into bewilderment. However, every examinee being ejected afterwards gave him even more shocks, one after the other. At this moment, he was already doubting whether there was an issue with his eyes or his memory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be that the brat didn’t enter the profound formation earlier and used some kind of method to secretly slip away?” Ji Hanfeng inwardly pondered. He couldn’t find any other possible explanation aside from this one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Sushan, did… did you see if Yun Che really went inside the trial’s profound formation?” Mu Xiaolan had almost the same exact thoughts as Ji Hanfeng. “He couldn’t have… used some kind of strange spatial profound artifact to secretly leave before the start of the exam, could he? Otherwise, why hasn’t he come out yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if she were to be beaten to death, she wouldn’t believe that someone at the fifth level of the Sovereign Profound Realm could stay in the Ice Profound Realm for that long. Though Mu Bingyun praised him many times, saying that he was a genius… he was still only at the Sovereign Profound Realm. She had also fought with Yun Che once…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Snow Region of Extreme Ice, when they first met, a casual slap from her had sent Yun Che flying...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Sushan did not directly reply. He held his chin with his hand and said with obvious surprise, “It seems like your Master has brought back a considerably gifted fellow, hoho. It’s been many years since I’ve had such a feeling of expectation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” Mu Xiaolan didn’t get him at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang… bang… bang....</span></p>
 <p><span style>While they were talking, several more examinees shot out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As time progressed, the difficulty of the Ice Profound Realm trial would increase. At this moment, examinees would be ejected once every few breaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eighty...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ninety...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ninety five...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ninety eight!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the ninety eighth person was ejected with white light swirling around his body, the profound formation finally quieted. A long time passed and no other examinee had been ejected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And with the number ninety eight, this obviously meant that there were still two people inside the Ice Profound Realm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mingcheng had not come out, which meant that one of them was Li Mingcheng… this was not unexpected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But who… could the other person be?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A full one hundred breaths had passed since the previous examinee had been ejected but the profound formation still showed no movements. “As expected of Li Mingcheng, to actually persevere so long without dying,” quietly exclaimed a profound practitioner who had passed the exam. They had all just recently experienced the terror of the Ice Profound Realm trial. Each Winterfrost Direwolf was a nightmarish existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s expected that Li Mingcheng is able to last this long. After all, he definitely has that kind of strength. But… who is the other person? To actually persevere without coming out until now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know. There didn’t seem to anyone who was on par with Li Mingcheng in the Snowstorm Realm trial.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could they have been hiding their strength?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, there’s no need for you to randomly guess.” Ji Hanfeng snorted coldly. At this point, he completely believed his own guess and said indifferently, “At the moment, there is only only one person in the Ice Profound Realm, not two. Because a certain trash was scared he would fail too miserably so before the Ice Profound Realm even started, he used a some kind of spatial artifact to escape… he probably used the same thing he used to cheat through the Snowstorm Realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Hanfeng’s words immediately allowed the group of examinees to “see the light.”</span></p>
