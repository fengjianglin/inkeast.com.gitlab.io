 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng’s entire body was covered in blood but he virtually felt no pain. No matter whether it was his body or his soul, the only things he felt were extreme rage and humiliation which threatened to boil over. He gave a furious roar as a green light flashed across his body and a gigantic whirlwind coalesced around him. The wind energy swiftly gathered around his right arm before he sent it smashing towards Yun Che’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This unrestrained blow was definitely one that sought to rob Yun Che of his life!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BANG!!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng came to a complete halt, his entire body stiffening. The right arm, which was filled with the greatest power he could muster, had actually been grabbed by Yun Che. It was as if his power was smashing against an impregnable rock that soared towards the heavens. The aftershock left his entire body numb, but Yun Che was practically unmoved by his own attack</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Luo Changsheng’s pupils contracted and it seemed as if he had fallen into a deep abyss. His palm felt like it was being bound by profound steel, and even if he caused all of the profound energy in his body to surge, he still could not struggle out of that grip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your strength isn’t bad,” Yun Che said as he looked at him through slitted eyes. “To think that you actually caused my hand to feel the slightest bit of pain. Heh… that’s worthy of praise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those words were very familiar to Luo Changsheng, because they were clearly the mocking words he had cast at Yun Che when he had blocked the Heaven Smiting Sword with his bare hands. As those words fell, Yun Che made a light movement with his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">CRACK!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of bone breaking resounded clearly in everyone’s ears as all the finger bones in Luo Changsheng’s right hand instantly broke apart. He let out an ear splitting cry as his right knee heavily smacked against the ground and his entire body spasmed violently in agony.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack!!</span></p>

As his palm twitched yet again, the finger bones, which were already broken, immediately turned to powder. Even his forearm had been mercilessly shattered by that movement. Luo Changsheng’s entire body shuddered and his pale white face actually turned a greenish purple. He desperately used all his might to move his energy and send it surging into his nerveless right arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A “bang” loudly rang out in the air as Luo Changsheng was sent flying into the distance as he finally escaped Yun Che’s viselike grip. But the throbbing pain coming from his right arm caused his entire body to drench itself in sweat as it shuddered. His originally beautiful and flawless face was distorted into a demonic visage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just this much strength and you want me to wish I was dead?” Yun Che gave a cold mocking laugh. Under normal circumstances, his Divine Spirit Realm aura would naturally be completely suppressed by Luo Changsheng’s Divine King Realm aura. But when he was under the effects of “Rumbling Heaven”, he instead completely and totally suppressed Luo Changsheng. So even if he did not rely on that heavenly might, which was only available to him for a short period of time, he still did not feel the least bit threatened by Luo Changsheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s… it’s not possible…” Luo Changsheng’s entire body shivered uncontrollably as his eyes, which beheld Yun Che, were filled with a deep shock and fear, “You clearly just survived a lightning tribulation and you’re clearly only at the Divine Spirit Realm… This isn’t possible…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che let out a low laugh as he slowly extended a hand towards Luo Changsheng, but he did not even bother to take out the Heaven Smiting Sword, “Didn’t you say that you wanted me to wish that I was dead? Come, use all of your tricks and methods. Like that Heart Burning Lightning of yours that will shorten your own life, use all of them. Just let me see how capable the youngest Divine King in the history of the God Realm, the grand and famous Young Master Changsheng, truly is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every word uttered by Yun Che cruelly mocked Luo Changsheng, every word agitated his soul which was already close to collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Luo Shangchen, who was using all his might to staunch Luo Guxie’s wound, raised his head and let out a loud yell, “Changsheng, don’t fight with him anymore! He’s completely different than he was before, you won’t be able to beat him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he was pushed to such desperate straits, how could Luo Changsheng, whose heart was filled with hatred and shame, be willing to give up? He fiercely sucked in a breath of air as he let out a loud yell, his left hand shining with bizarrely colored lightning before he resolutely thrust it towards his own chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had, astonishingly enough, not hesitated to use the Heart Burning Lightning which burned one’s lifespan in order to increase one’s profound strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was at this moment that a mocking cold light flashed in the depths of Yun Che’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM————</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s figure suddenly disappeared and he instantly appeared like a ghost in front of Luo Changsheng as a cluster of golden flames fiercely exploded against his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the explosive flames, Luo Changsheng spat out an arrow of blood and was once more sent flying into the distance. When he finally landed on the ground, the wound, which had already been sliced apart by lightning previously, completely ruptured as a cloud of blood slowly spread around his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng knelt to the ground limply, his face a ghastly white and his entire body was spouting blood. The Heart Burning Lightning that he had used his blood essence to evoke had completely dissipated as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I seem to have suddenly changed my mind,” Yun Che said in a relaxed tone as he walked towards Luo Changsheng at a leisurely pace, “but please do not misunderstand. It’s not that I’m afraid of your Heart Burning Lightning, it’s just that I want you to understand something.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s finger drew an arc in the air as he pointed his right hand at Luo Changsheng and coldly declared, “Luo Changsheng, the current you that stands before me is nothing more than a pitiful toy that I can toss around at my own leisure. If I want you to use a power, then you can use that power. If I do not want you to use that power, then you can forget about ever using it, understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Or perhaps, you could immediately admit your defeat and surrender right now in front of me. After all, even though a defeated dog is ugly to look at, at least you can save yourself a lot of pain. Don’t you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A large mouthful of fresh blood fiercely sprayed from Luo Changsheng’s mouth as his body continued to shudder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His previous mocking, insulting, and humiliating words were all thrown back, unchanged, into his teeth by Yun Che. Even though he was facing the same methods and the same words, to Luo Changsheng, this was undoubtedly many times, no, even tens of times more humiliating than it had been for Yun Che!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uk….” It seemed as if a frenzied and vicious beast had entered Luo Changsheng’s chest as it rose and fell with such intensity that it looked like it would explode at any moment. His eyes were filled with confusion and disorder but there finally came a moment when his eyes completely lost all focus, and Luo Changsheng himself had lost all reason. All of the wounds on his body split open, and his entire person seemed like a desperate and hopeless wild beast, as he rushed towards Yun Che with an ear splitting cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was before today’s events, no one would be able to believe that Luo Changsheng could be reduced to his present state. He was, after all, Luo Changsheng… the Young Master Changsheng who stood at the head of the Four God Children of the Eastern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the humiliation he had inflicted previously had been returned to him ten times over. His strength as a Divine King had been trampled over in the blink of an eye. The master that he was most proud of had not hesitated to throw away her dignity as a Divine Master to protect him, but she was wounded by the counterattack… His body, his strength, his pride, his glory, all of his dignity… all of this had been trampled under Yun Che’s feet and kicked into a deep abyss.</span></p>

He waved his hand, and all of a sudden, the crackle of electricity was emitted from his hand as deep purple lightning flashed from his palm to explode towards Luo Changsheng.</span></p>

Following that, he let out a wail of despair which seemed to come from the depths of hell itself.</span></p>

But if… he is able to fully comprehend the principles of the tribulation lightning sent down by the heavenly law, and his profound strength reaches a sufficient level, perhaps, he may be able to release that… white tribulation lightning.”</span></p>

He did not even bother to give Luo Changsheng’s pale and distorted face a single look as he coldly declared, “Luo Changsheng, we were originally no more than simple opponents. Yet you just had to force me to become your enemy. Heh, that’s right, you are the scion of the Holy Eaves Realm King and the disciple of Luo Guxie. There is no one that you need fear, and all along, it has only been the other way around. Whether you wanted to trample over anyone was up to your whims and fancy, but it’s a pity that I just happen to be someone who is fearless!”</span></p>

He recognized that perhaps Luo Guxie was right and he had never truly understood the son that he had been most proud of. The Luo Changsheng he had known and understood was merely the Luo Changsheng that his son had wanted him to see and understand.</span></p>

Not only was her action despicable, it completely shamed the entire profound way while offending my Eternal Heaven Realm and this Profound God Convention. So how will your Holy Eaves Realm account for this matter?”</span></p>
