It was only after a long period of time that he roused himself from his daydream and knelt down in panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Isn’t this that ‘child of the heavens’ that drew a nine stage heavenly tribulation to him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heavenly Poison Star God Moonflower looked Yun Che once over with her beautiful eyes that glowed a faint green light. Her red lips that were tinged with jade curved into a smile that did not seem like a smile. She had only said those few words but the coquettish charm contained within was overwhelming. Even Xing Ling’s body went entirely limp, his head sank down deeply and he did not even dare to steal a glance at Moonflower.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che also bowed his head deeply and kept himself stone still.</span></p>

Yun Che’s body clearly shuddered as he replied in a panicked voice, “To have Senior Heavenly Poison remember my name, it is… this junior’s fortune.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehehehe,” Moonflower tittered coquettishly, her bosom heaving dramatically in the air. “Little brother, right now in heaven and earth, who doesn’t recognize your name? Actually… the way you address me as ‘Senior Heavenly Poison’ is truly unpleasant to the ear. Just call me Moonflower.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che’s lips twitched, but no sound came out, it was as if he was afraid of responding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Demon Star God’s eyebrows furrowed slightly.</span></p>

An exceptionally long and slender finger was raised as it coquettishly touched the tip of Yun Che’s chin, and an enrapturing flowery scent accompanied it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s heart was given a minor jolt and because his head was bowed low in the first place, he was given a front row seat to fully admire Moonflower’s heaving bosom.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little brother Yun Che is not only possessed of enough might to bowl over all the gathered god emperors, but you also look so very attractive. Ah, just looking at you causes this servant’s heart to beat uncontrollably.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moonflower’s long and shapely eyebrows arched provocatively as her eyes rippled like water, giving off an unspeakably foxy allure, her voice was soft and syrupy as candy floss. It seemed as if she could not wait to fling herself into his embrace and exhaust all her amorous energy on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If anyone saw this scene, they would definitely not dare believe that this was one of the peerlessly terrifying Twelve Star Gods of the Star God Realm.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moonflower did not get angry at this action. Instead she languidly pulled her arm back and spoke with slanted eyes, “Aiyah, this servant is just one small woman, so when I see such an attractive and handsome little brother, it will definitely cause my heart to race. It’s not like I’ll eat him up or anything. Ah, look how anxious I’ve made you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heavenly Demon Star God, “...”</span></p>

Once you reach the Star God Realm, you must come visit me often, okay? And at that time, no matter what you want to do to me, I will happily accommodate you. Hehehehehe….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she let our her seductive laugh, Moonflower’s willowy waist turned and she left, a sweet smelling wind billowing in her wake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Demon Star God gave Yun Che a look before speaking in a low voice, “Forget every single word that she just said. The further away you stay from her, the better.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I thank… Senior Heavenly Demon,” Yun Che’s voice faintly trembled and it seemed as if he had not yet completely shaken himself free of Moonflower’s bewitchment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Demon Star God turned around as well and in the blink of an eye, he had already moved far away from Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s chest rose and fell heavily, his eyes growing slightly heavy and his gaze slowly growing cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xing Ling got up to his feet and let out a long sigh of relief. He lifted a hand to wipe his forehead, leaving the back of his hand covered in cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xing Ling wanted to warn Yun Che to never draw near to the Heavenly Poison Star God, but he was terrified that the Heavenly Star Poison God, who had just left, would hear him, so he could only whisper a small reminder to Yun Che, “Young Master Yun Che, Lord Heavenly Poison has always liked to… play pranks on people. So you must not take the words she just said seriously.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mn, I understand.” Yun Che nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xing Ling’s eyes slanted to the side and said, “Lords Heavenly Poison and Heavenly Demon should be preparing to leave first. You should wait with me for this short period of time. The god emperor may want to see you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Yun Che could naturally only obey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------------------------</span></p>

The same name, he looks at least ninety percent similar. Yet it just so happens that they aren’t the same person.” Moonflower wore a thoughtful expression on her face as she let out a coquettish laugh, “Right now, I simply can’t wait to see the look on Jasmine’s face when she sees him, hehehehe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Demon Star God’s brows faintly furrowed as he coldly said, “What does this have to do with Her Highness Jasmine? That person you’re referring to…. Could it be that Her Highness Jasmine also knows him?”</span></p>

When the Brahma Heaven God Emperor wanted to pledge his daughter in marriage, that was clearly Qianye Ying’er’s intention. And regardless of whether she truly had that intention or if it was merely a feint, those few words created enough enemies for Yun Che to cover the heavens and the earth. Those men who are smitten with Qianye Ying’er, even I would shudder in fear when I think about them. So to be envied and hated by them… is truly a pity indeed.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aiyah, that’s why I always say, you men are the ones who really don’t understand yourselves.” Moonflower fiddled with her fingers as she said in soft and languid voice, “You simply underestimate the ‘hatred born of jealousy’ that occurs in men when it comes to women. You’re also giving Qianye Ying’er way too little credit…. Of the men that she’s fixed her attentions upon, which one of them has had a good ending?”</span></p>

Hmph, even the Brahma Heaven God Emperor and the Eternal Heaven God Emperor did not care about their dignity because of this, so for this emperor to behave this way would be nothing more than ordinary,” the Star God Emperor said with flat eyes. “He rejected the Eternal Heaven God Emperor, the Brahma Heaven God Emperor, and the Dragon Monarch. So this king was merely testing the waters when I said that I would get Jasmine to personally impart the skill to him. Yet he immediately agreed to it, and this king was truly not expecting that.”</span></p>

What designs could he have on our Star God Realm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“According to the information we have gathered to date, Yun Che only arrived in the God Realm three years ago, and in these three years, he has only been to the Snow Song and Flame God Realms, and he is ignorant about the rest of the star realms. My emperor has always been thoughtful and cautious. But even though this person is shrouded in mystery, we don’t need to think too much about the reason why he wants to visit our Star God Realm. My king should focus his attention on ‘other things’. We can definitely obtain a bountiful harvest with fifteen days worth of time.”</span></p>

After that, we journey home.”</span></p>

Her arrival caused the bodies of the Heavenly Wolf Star Guards that were stationed outside to go completely cold. Yet no one moved forward, and even when Jasmine moved forward and pushed open the great gates of the palace, no one made a single action or sound… so they naturally did not even think of stopping her.</span></p>

Even though Jasmine drew near, she refused to look back at her. Her only visible reaction was that her lips were curled up in a slight pout.</span></p>

Caizhi could also feel that the gaze that was burning into her back was just as cold as the voice that spoke to her.</span></p>

She spoke in a tiny voice, “I won’t dare do it again. From now on… from now on, I’ll definitely listen to what Big Sister says. I won’t act on my own initiative. Big Sister… please stop being angry at me!”</span></p>

Her heart was immediately thrown into disarray as she said, “Big Sister, I really know that I’m wrong this time. I guarantee that from now on I won’t ever… I won’t ever do it again. If not I’ll… I’ll….”</span></p>

The Caizhi who had inherited the power of the Heavenly Wolf Star God possessed power that allowed her to not fear anyone, and possessed a status that allowed her to rule over everything. She no longer needed protection, she was no longer bullied and humiliated as people looked on with cold eyes. She had her own god palace, her own Star Guards, and no matter where she went, the four words “Heavenly Wolf Star God” were regarded with a god-like reverence.</span></p>

The Heavenly Wolf divine power within her was still far from completely awakening and her power was undoubtedly the weakest among the Twelve Star Gods.</span></p>

She clenched her small fists tightly as her gaze gradually grew determined, “Okay, I… will definitely do it! I will prove to Big Sister that I haven’t been slacking off at all in the last two years!”</span></p>

The moment you leave this place, the first Star God that you meet shall be your opponent! As for how you are to persuade that person to be your opponent, that is something you will have to deal with yourself.”</span></p>
