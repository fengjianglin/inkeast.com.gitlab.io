It was as if the entire Eastern Divine Region was being covered in a big wok, the atmosphere had become extremely oppressive and suffocating. Furthermore, gigantic tidal waves were surging and churning in countless ocean regions despite the complete absence of wind and all four corners of the Eastern Divine Region were blanketed with a terrifying aura which seemed to signal the coming of the end of days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, beneath the white lightning domain, the space around the Conferred God Stage continued to violently shudder. That was the violent trembling of the very heavenly law itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the lightning domain, the indistinct image of the pale white lightning dragon was gradually becoming more and more solid as it stopped its coiling motion. Slowly, a lustrous white dragon head stretched out from the depths of the lightning domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instance, countless bolts of lightning shook the sky. Most of the profound practitioners were so shaken by this that they numbly sank to the ground. Every fiber of their being caused them to curl up and tremble weakly, and no matter how much effort they mustered, they could not force their limp bodies back to their feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could this be possible?” The eyes of the Eternal Heaven God Emperor swept over the chaos that had engulfed the Conferred God Stage as his heart grew more and more alarmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The power that belonged to the heavenly law was a power of law and governance that was placed above all beings. It was an existence that was everywhere, but at the same time, it was also an existence that was impossible to fathom. But the most observable phenomenon of the heavenly law was the lightning tribulations that were sent down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lightning tribulations sent by the heavenly law were originally only used to punish and test those profound practitioners which had broken through to the Divine Tribulation Realm. It was classified as a kind of principle and governance that was under the purview of the heavenly law. This was something that was regarded as the most basic knowledge among all profound practitioners of the divine way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the current power, which came from the heavenly law, and was flowing out had already exceeded the category of “lightning tribulation” countless times over. In fact, it had already gone beyond the limit of what a human could possibly bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just the oppressive might alone was enough to shock and terrify a whole bunch of divine profound practitioners to the extent that they wished for death instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This definitely was not merely just a “test”. It was definitely the might of the heavenly law displayed to its extreme limit. This was a complete and thorough “punishment”, one which left no room for interpretation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the heavenly law had not felt the most extreme fear, then this would not have happened!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The so-called “jealousy of the heavens” had always merely been words used to express great regret, because how could there really be an existence in this world that would provoke the envy of the heavenly law.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, everyone present could clearly feel that they were witnessing the true “jealousy of the heavens”!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nine tribulations… nine tribulations….” the head of the Heavenly Mystery Three Elders, Mo Yu, muttered to himself in a dazed and dispirited manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is it truly… nine tribulations?” Mo Wen’s current mental state mirrored that of Mo Yu’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nine tribulations… the predictions of our ancestor…” Mo Yu mumbled with a dazed expression on his face, it was as if he had entered a dream world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, Mo Yu’s body suddenly seized up and shook. He turned towards the Eternal Heaven God Emperor and shouted, “God emperor! Quickly raise up the barrier! The power of the heavenly law has already gone berserk, it is possible… that the others may get swept up in this as well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unless there was someone who was willing to court death and forcibly interfere, a lightning tribulation would definitely never harm other people. The might of the previous eight stages of tribulation lightning had already been vast, but all of it had been solely focused within the confines of the Conferred God Stage and not a single bit of it had leaked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now the power of the heavenly law was shaking and going out of control, and even the great Divine Masters and god emperors in this place could feel it perfectly clearly, much less the Heavenly Mystery Three Elders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eternal Heaven God Emperor did not hesitate in the slightest. He let out a loud roar that traversed across the entire Eternal Heaven Realm, “Everyone immediately leave this region, flee as far away as you possibly can! Protect the young generation! There is something strange going on with the power that originates from the heavenly law! The moment this lightning tribulation descends upon us, it will have enough power to obliterate a Divine Master… Flee at once!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Enough power to obliterate a Divine Master…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those words were like thunderbolts that dropped from the highest of heavens, especially since the words had been uttered by the Eternal Heaven God Emperor himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Conferred God Stage was immediately thrown into complete disarray. But just as the audience was about to flee, a loud explosion rang out in the sky. Within the pale white lightning domain, the white lightning dragon released a roar that sounded part dragon roar, part cry of heavenly wrath. After that it descended from the sky and entered the world of man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Space ripped apart like silk whenever it came into contact with the body of the dragon. It was as if the entire world was being chiseled into two halves from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The might of heaven exploded forth and everyone immediately felt as if countless mountains had been dropped on their backs. Fleeing was no longer an option and maybe it had already been too late to even try by then. The Eternal Heaven God Emperor took to the sky and let out a sharp yell, “Gathered profound practitioners, listen to my orders! Focus all your power on sealing the Conferred God Stage!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Eternal Heaven God Emperor had given his order, the seven Eternal Heaven guardians who were present immediately moved. Their bodies flickered as they arrived at the borders of the Conferred God Stage. They looked like twinkling stars streaking across the sky as blazing light radiated from their bodies. Profound energy that surged like the ocean was being released without hesitation. This profound energy soon formed an extremely strong sealing barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eternal Heaven guardians were, along with the Star Gods of the Star God Realm and the Moon Gods of the Moon God Realm, supreme existences which were second only to the four great god emperors within the Eastern Divine Region. Every single one of them possessed the earth-shaking strength of a Divine Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So one could well imagine just how strong a barrier forged by the combined power of all seven of them was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside of the guardians themselves, all of the adjudicators in the area surged forward after receiving orders from Honorable Qu Hui as they also sent their power into the barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qianze, I’ll be entrusting Meiyin and Yingyue to you! Everyone else, follow me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Qianheng took to the skies as soon as he could, the gathered Divine Sovereigns of the Glazed Light Realm following closely behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Gathered elders, to me! The rest of you, protect the younger discipes!” Luo Shangchen bellowed in a deep voice as he led the gathered Divine Sovereigns and rushed forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Guxie did not follow after Luo Shangchen. Instead, she gave a toss of her robe as an invisible barrier formed around Luo Changsheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stronger you were as a profound practitioner, the better you would be able to feel the dreadfulness of this heavenly might. The strength of the seven guardians was extremely terrifying, but compared to the heavenly power before them, everyone present could clearly feel a sense of powerlessness, and they knew that it was extremely possible that the seven guardians would not be able to seal this pale white tribulation lightning. As a result, all of the gathered Divine Masters and Divine Sovereigns took action instead of retreating, as they poured all of the profound energy they could muster into the barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The isolation barrier, which was originally transparent, began to glow brightly with profound light as it squarely kept the area of Conferred God Stage tightly sealed within. Furthermore, this barrier contained the all the profound energy of more than half the Divine Masters in the Eastern Divine Region, as well as all the profound energy of countless Divine Sovereigns.
