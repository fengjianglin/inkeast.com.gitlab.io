In a world where all light had been devoured, his face still looked startlingly white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of this struggling that you have already schemed up is nothing more than a sad and pathetic joke to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath that devilish might that could burn everything to ash, Yun Che’s words cut into their souls like a hot knife through butter. Yan Tianxiao turned his head toward him with much difficulty, but he still held the Yama Devil Spear in a deathgrip. “We descendants of the Yama Realm will die before we surrender! If you want to take over our Yama Realm… you’ll have to step over this king’s cold dead body first!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take over your Yama Realm?” Yun Che let out an extremely contemptuous laugh. “Yan Tianxiao, you’re not only naive, but it seems like your ears aren’t working too well either. Your three ancestors told all of you to submit to me as your ruler. When did I ever say I wanted to take over your Yama Realm!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yan Tianxiao was stunned by those words, “What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh!” Yun Che looked down at him and said words that shook him to his very core. “I want to be the emperor of the Northern Region, not just the emperor of this measly Yama Realm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Tianxiao: “...!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Yama Realm will still remain the Yama Realm. You, the current Yama Emperor, will still remain the Yama Emperor. However, I will reign supreme in this dark Northern Divine Region!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che slowly lowered one of his raised hands and pointed it toward Yan Tianxiao. “So tell me right now. Are you going to embrace the dark ruler who will change the destiny of the entire Northern Divine Region? Or are you going to let this Yama Realm… be thrown into an eternal abyss of darkness!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Tianxiao and the denizens of the Yama Realm stood there with blank expressions on their face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had first forced them into a corner and driven them to the brink of despair. But now he had suddenly shown them a way out, he had given them a new hope… Yun Che had done this to the Three Yama Ancestors, and he was now doing the same thing to the Yama Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they chose to submit… it would mean that the Yama Realm would no longer be the most exalted existence in the world. It would mean that there would be someone who could control them and use them as he saw fit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the Three Yama Ancestors had been willing to bow to this person, and with a wave of his hand, he had brought the Yama Realm to the brink of utter destruction… When they considered those things, they realized that he really was qualified to rule over them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the owner of the Yama Realm was not going to change. The Yama Devils would remain the Yama Devils, the Yama Ghosts would still be the Yama Ghosts, and even the Yama Emperor would remain the Yama Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If that was really true, then there was no need for all of them to die in this pointless struggle, no need for the collapse of the Yama Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many gazes began settling on Yan Tianxiao’s body and they no longer contained any determination or will to fight. Instead, they seemed to be pleading with him soundlessly to submit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Royal father…” Yan Wu muttered. Even she, the coldest and most obstinate one among them, felt most of the tension bleed out of her heart when she heard Yun Che’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they had at least a ten percent chance of winning this battle, more than half of the Yama Devils might have chosen to fight to the death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, if they ended up dying for nothing, destroying their home for nothing...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, submission seemed to be a far better option than it had been before...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Tianxiao’s chest heaved violently as his eyes wavered. All the other sounds in the world gradually grew silent and he could soon only hear the sound of his own ragged breathing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three ancestors, the Yama Devil Nether Crossing Cauldron, the inheritance of the Devil Emperor, the fact that Yun Che could instantly summon the power of the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness, the choice to die in vain defiance, the survival of the Yama Realm...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, he breathed out a long sigh as his brows knitted together. When he spoke, his voice was as deep as the ocean. “Yun Che, please answer the one question that this king has.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who is the pawn? You or the Devil Queen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Tianxiao asked a question so sharp that everyone stopped breathing once they heard it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a question that was extremely provocative.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh, that’s a good question.” Yun Che chuckled. “In her eyes, I am a unique and irreplaceable pawn. However…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A black light flashed in his hand and a pitch-black magatama shaped like a crescent moon appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Burning Moon Exquisite Devil Jade!” Yan Tianxiao suddenly took a step forward when he saw that object appear in Yun Che’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Burning Moon had fallen, it had ended up under the Soul Stealing Realm’s control so Yan Tianxiao had always figured that the Burning Moon Exquisite Devil Jade had fallen into the Devil Queen Chi Wuyao’s hands. He had never imagined that Yun Che would have it in his possession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had the Yama Devil Nether Crossing Cauldron on one side and the Burning Moon Exquisite Devil Jade on the other and the two different gloomy black lights that emanated from these two objects soundlessly mixed together in front of Yun Che. It was a scene that was deeply etched into everyone’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Today, the lifelines of both the Yama Realm and the Burning Moon Realm have fallen into my hands.” Yun Che’s lips slowly curved into a calm and sinister smile. “So why don’t you take a guess… at who is going to be next?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A long and deathly silence immediately descended upon the room as the very air around them turned solid. Nobody dared to breathe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang——</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yama Devil Spear slipped from Yan Tianxiao’s hand and fell to the ground with a loud clatter. The sound of metal striking stone reverberated through the hearts of all who heard it.</span></p>

Of course, that was to borrow his influence to capture the hearts and the minds of the profound practitioners of the Northern Divine Region. And once he was crowned emperor, all of her plans would proceed as planned.</span></p>
