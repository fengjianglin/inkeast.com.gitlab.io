He had even said the exact same words back to her… However, he had said them in a voice that was as dark and sinister as an evil spirit’s wail. Even as he ground his teeth together, his voice had practically throbbed with a dark delight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue gently closed her eyes as her face went ghastly pale. This deathly pallor started to spread from her face to her snowy neck and the jade fingers which gripped the Purple Pylon Divine Sword started to tremble lightly. A whisper as soft and faint as a dream escaped her lips. “Is fate… really that… inexorable…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fate? Hahahaha…” Though Xia Qingyue had whispered those words to herself very quietly, Yun Che had still heard it loud and clear. He gave a cold mocking laugh, “Oh no, this is retribution! You personally destroyed everything that was important to me… So how could I… not return your gift in kind!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he saw Xia Qingyue try her best to keep the pain she was feeling from appearing on her face, Yun Che’s face contorted in delight. He had dreamed of this moment every night over the last few years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This day had finally come and he was also finally able to vent the extreme hatred he felt toward Xia Qingyue, a hatred which had embedded itself in the depths of his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you know how much of my blood, sweat, and tears went into preparing this grand gift for you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s lips crooked up in a sinister grin. “These are devil crystals which were formed from the concentrated corpse energy of primordial True Devils. They are rare treasures that will never appear in this world again! Yet I’ve gifted all of these valuable treasures to your Moon God Realm… Heh heh heh heh, when you reach the nine hells, don’t forget to express your gratitude to me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s body and eyes flashed with black light simultaneously as the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor Sword appeared in his hands. As the Devil Master of the Northern Region opened up the “Hell Monarch” gate, his relentless killing intent locked onto Xia Qingyue’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er’s golden eyes shifted toward Xia Qingyue as a golden light flashed out from around her waist. As she flung out Divine Oracle, the darkness energy radiating from her body soundlessly merged with Yun Che’s frenzied darkness profound energy, causing a heavy and oppressive dark might to descend upon Xia Qingyue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The things which had destroyed the Moon God Realm were precisely these Devil Crystals of Eternal Darkness which had come from the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Devil Crystals of Eternal Darkness were formed from the concentrated yin energy inside the bones of the primordial True Devils buried in the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness. They contained the most dense and high level darkness energy in the current universe. They were also extremely volatile and the slightest contact with an external force would cause them to explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the three mighty Yama Ancestors had never dared to approach or come into contact with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this universe, only Yun Che could perfectly control them and an Immaculate Barrier was the only thing that could transport them with no mishaps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since it could only be formed from the highest level of primordial yin energy, it was extremely rare and it could no longer be produced. After Yun Che had harvested all of the Devil Crystals of Eternal Darkness from the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness, he had fed a very tiny portion to Hong’er. He had given the rest of them… to the Moon God Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they had spread out the use of these Devil Crystals of Eternal Darkness, they would have produced even more spectacular results in their ongoing war against the Eastern Divine Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, from the very first moment Yun Che had come into contact with these Devil Crystals of Eternal Darkness, this plan had started to crazily form in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A streak of dull blood silently trickled from the corner of Xia Qingyue’s pale lips. But when she opened her eyes, there was only a calm and gloomy coldness contained within them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Purple light began to gather in her eyes once more as she slowly raised an arm. The divine light that shone from the Purple Pylon Divine Sword also stopped quivering as it quietly started to gather and gain in intensity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s end this.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This simple stab of her sword caused purple light to fill the sky. In the blink of an eye, even the rampaging spatial storms had been torn asunder.&nbsp;</span></p>

He did not need to gather any dark energy for his attack, because the moment his sword swept down, darkness filled the sky and his tyrannical sword might resembled a devil god descending to the earth as it exploded toward Xia Qingyue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Purple Pylon divine power and dark devilish light frantically and chaotically clashed against each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang bang bang bang bang——</span></p>

If one were to view their fight from a distant star realm, it would look as if two planets, one purple and one black, were colliding together catastrophically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Moon God Emperor versus the Devil Master of the North. A furious battle on this level meant that every instant, every single clash, was as terrifying as a calamity. Furthermore, they had already fully released their world-shattering might from the very start of the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!</span></p>

Xia Qingyue’s long hair floated in the air as a soft sigh came from her lips. “You truly are the successor of the Heretic God. Your cultivation is only at the tenth level of the Divine Sovereign Realm, but you already have the power of a god emperor. This sort of growth and transcendent power is truly unique in this world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then let this Devil Master personally send you off!” Yun Che raised his arm and flames erupted from the body of his sword. They swiftly transformed from those familiar crimson flames into the Devil Flames of Eternal Calamity which could incinerate and devour everything in this universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though no light shone from these flames, they were swiftly devouring all of the light in the area.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was convinced that if she did not help, Yun Che would have no chance of beating Xia Qingyue, much less killing her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In four short years, Yun Che’s progress, which had been bolstered by both the power of the Heretic God and a Devil Emperor, was practically unrivaled in this universe. However, Xia Qingyue’s progress… was also incredibly shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had only been seven years since she had inherited the Purple Pylon divine power but her strength had already outstripped the strength of Yue Wuya in his prime!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the history of the Moon God Realm… No, in the history of all of the king realms, there was no other person who had acclimated to their divine power as quickly and as completely as Xia Qingyue had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had just finished speaking when her eyebrows trembled. She immediately thrust her Divine Oracle forward, dark energy surging up from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ding!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A beam of purple light seemed to have transcended both time and space as it instantly crossed dozens of kilometers to pierce Qianye Ying’er’s throat. When it clashed with Divine Oracle, it caused the space around them to shatter into countless fragments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After she had dealt with that beam of purple light, Xia Qingyue had stepped through space and appeared in front of her. She attacked Qianye Ying’er once more and as the Purple Pylon Divine Sword shot out, her actions resembled the dance of a celestial goddess. She seemed to weave in and out of reality and every time she appeared to attack Qianye Ying’er, she would leave a purple moon in her wake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che swiveled around but by the time he did that, purple moons had already filled the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body instantly flashed toward them. The Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor Sword glowed with a gloomy and hellish light as he swept out a horizontal slash, instantly destroying a purple moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the purple moon ruptured, a glaringly brilliant purple light erupted from within. It instantly flooded the entire region, causing Yun Che’s vision and the space around them to turn a pure lustrous purple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His sight was not the only thing which had been obscured within this purple space. Even his senses were being warped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Yun Che launched that attack, he was not the only one who became trapped in the Purple Moon Prison. Qianye Ying’er had been caught up in that surprise attack as well. All of her senses immediately became muddled and it felt as though millions of sword beams were shooting toward her. As she backpedaled furiously, a beam of purple sword light shot out from the side of this purple world and pierced toward her back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That sword beam seemed to be slow and sluggish but everything it touched, even space itself, was shattered into fragments the moment they came into contact with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time Qianye Ying’er noticed, the sword beam was already right in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Purple Moon Prison was one of Yue Wuya’s divine techniques, Qianye Fantian had told her about it many times. It was an attack that used Purple Pylon divine power to confuse a person’s heart and vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was the first time that she had experienced this attack for herself. Furthermore, the speed and manner in which Xia Qingyue had executed this attack was far too different from her understanding of it, catching her by surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">CRAAACK!</span></p>

His attack tore the Purple Moon Prison apart but the Devil Flames of Eternal Calamity had gone out as well. He left a long scar of ice behind him as he flashed to Qianye Ying’er’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Psssst!</span></p>

Droplets of blood flew into the air as the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor Sword heavily smashed into Xia Qingyue’s sword arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the Devil Flames of Eternal Calamity had been extinguished when he broke the Purple Moon Prison apart, Yun Che’s sword might was so dreadful that it blasted Xia Qingyue into the distance with a thunderous bang. The red sleeve covering her right arm had been ripped to shreds and a deep and shocking groove of blood had been carved into her arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She did not bother to inspect her injured arm. Instead, she stared at the bloody hole in the side of Yun Che’s chest. She said in a calm voice, “Yun Che, do you still remember the vow you made to me back then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmmm?” Yun Che raised his head to look at her. He also paid no attention to the wound Xia Qingyue had inflicted on him and the only thing that shone in his eyes was a fierce killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could summon Yan One, Yan Two, and Yan Three any time he wanted. If they fought Xia Qingyue together, they would have more than enough methods to kill her at their disposal… But she had to die at his hands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His homeland, his family and friends, had all been personally destroyed by Xia Qingyue so how could he allow her to die at anyone else’s hands? No, he had to kill her himself so he could avenge them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue slowly tightened her grip on the handle of her sword. However, she was not doing so because of the pain of her wounded arm. Right now, the solemn and severe words that she had said to Yun Che after he had planted the slave imprint on Qianye Ying’er were reverberating in her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qianye Ying’er is now your slave. You can order her around, make use of her, vent your anger on her, humiliate her, and ravish her as you please… you can do whatever you want to her. But there is something that you must remember!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She is still someone that I must kill! Making her your slave with this scheme of mine does not mean that I don’t wish to kill her. Rather, it only means that I can’t kill her right now! Whatever happens between the two of you is none of my business. But… you definitely must not develop any feelings for her! Even more than that, you definitely must not have any children with her! Understand!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che had blocked a blow for Qianye Ying’er. He had moved quicker than thought, in an almost instinctive manner...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the energy that they had so naturally linked together just now...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forget it.” After she whispered those words in a very soft voice, she raised her purple sword to the heavens before drawing a very gentle arc in the air with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, it was as if a new dawn had broken.

All of the storms in the area had died down instantly. The only thing that seemed to exist in the world right now was that gigantic purple moon that had appeared behind Xia Qingyue. It transformed the entire star region into a world of hazy purple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under that purple light, the space around them actually started to vibrate with a strange light.</span></p>
