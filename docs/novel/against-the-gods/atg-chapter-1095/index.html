In a few hours, the Soul Sect had received a reply. They had found the location of “Poison Saint Blackheart”. As they had initially guessed, he was inside Darkya City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Darkya branch sect sent people to the location at top speed, however the reply the main sect got after caused Lei Qianfeng to erupt in rage.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rejected?” Lei Qianfeng frowned, “He obviously doesn’t have the guts to come! Heh, he’s indeed a fake! How can there be such a coincidence in this world!?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard!” Lei Qianfeng already had a stomachful of rage when he heard these words. It was as if his lungs would explode. “An impersonator actually dares to slight my Soul Sect! Once he cures Mo’er, I will personally kill him!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master!” Lei De Yan hurriedly interjected, “What Chief Hall Master said earlier wasn’t wrong. The Poison Saint has countless foes, no one would ever dare to impersonate him. Although this old one has never seen Poison Saint Blackheart, I’ve heard of his extremely strange personality. Blackheart is extremely arrogant. Several powers of the middle star realms have made many requests of him. Him looking down on our sect, which is located in a lower star realm… is actually quite normal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bullshit!” Lei Qianfeng yelled. “My Soul Sect is not some ordinary sect! Furthermore I have the backing of the Divine Martial Realm! Just a mere poison doctor, within this Darkya Realm of mine, what qualifications does he have to be arrogant? Furthermore he’s most likely to be a fake!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qianfeng! Stop hesitating, Mo’er is about to die!” Xiao Qingtong wailed, “On the off chance he is really Poison Saint Blackheart…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut up! I sent men to invite him, that’s already a display of sincerity. He wants me, the almighty Darkya Realm King to personally beg him, a tiny worthless poison doctor?” Lei Qianfeng was a picture of utter rage. “If he’s a fake, then I, Lei Qianfeng, would utterly lose face! Even if he’s real, with the foundations of our Soul Sect, should we be compared to a homeless dog of a wandering poison doctor? My Soul Sect can’t detoxify this poison, on what basis is he able to?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master…”</span></p>

After having been played by this “Ling Yun” for more than half a month and not even catching a trace of his shadow, his favorite son was now hanging in the balance of life and death due to Ling Yun’s machinations. Under these circumstances, how could he keep his cool? He then suddenly recalled and gruffly shouted, “That’s it! Thunder Toad! The Thunder Toad! Go and get the gift that the Divine Martial Realm bestowed us. Bring the Thunder Toad here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Thunder… Thunder Toad?” Everyone got a big fright “But… The Thunder Toad is a poisonous species, if Sect Master’s intention is to use poison to fight poison… I’m afraid…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just bring it here now! Perhaps it can save Mo’er!” yelled Lei Qianfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The poison Guangmo came from an ancient horned dragon that was more than six hundred thousand years old. This poison wasn’t any ordinary poison that could be easily resolved. The most fearsome thing about this wasn’t its toxicity but rather the special life force within it that could also penetrate into the bones and soul of its victim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If a large amount penetrated one’s soul, even Divine Sovereign Mu Bingyun could only just wait for an eventual death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Thunder Toad could actually use its poison to counteract other poisons, especially under the guidance of Lei Qianfeng who was a mighty Divine King Realm expert but never in Lei Qianfeng’s life would he have ever guessed that Lei Guangmo’s poison came from a poisonous dragon of the Divine Master Realm. Although the Thunder Toad was a rarity, compared to the level of the dragon, it was simply a case of being as different as heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Thunder Toad entered Guangmo’s body, they initially saw a measure of effectiveness. The redness on Lei Guangmo’s body receded a little bit and even his painful state started to stabilize. Everyone started to be happy and hopeful…. But just a few minutes later, Lei Guangmo’s body jerked about furiously as if he was suddenly being shaken by something, it seemed that the poison that was being suppressed by the poison toad had been angered and was now erupting at full force. Crimson fumes accompanied by a toxic aura countless times stronger than earlier started to rise from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mo’er!! What happened… Why is it like this…” Xiao Qingtong’s face was totally pale, she screamed herself hoarse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...Mother… Save… Me… Ah… Ahhhhh…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blood in every part of his body started to burn with intense heat. The crimson fumes were so thick that it now covered his body, making difficult to see through to him. After letting out the last cry of his life, Lei Guangmo had no more breath in him. He had died under the poisonous effects of the ancient horned dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mo’er… Mo’er!!” Xiao Qingtong was inconsolable as she fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master… Mistress… condolences…” Lei Tiangang softly sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Lei Qianfeng stood still, as if his feet were glued to the floor. The pain and anger being evident in his flickering pupils. Not a peep came out of him as his entire body convulsed and he fell backwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master!!” Lei Qiandu shouted in horror, rushing forward to catch him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ling Yun… Ling… Yun…” Lei Qianfeng kept on repeating Ling Yun’s name as if his soul only had that name imprinted on it. Eventually he opened his eyes wide as a fiendish aura surged wildly out of him. He roared crazily, “Ling Yun! I will kill you!! I WILL KILL YOU!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tiangang, immediately… Activate all activatable defensive formations! Send out all disciples from all sixty four halls, stake out every place that Ling Yun might appear at! Once you find his whereabouts, use everything you have to kill him, split him into ten thousand pieces!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Qianfeng’s roar was like thunder rampaging throughout the entire sect. Causing every member of the sect to shudder. The anger, sorrow, and hatred within it terrified each and every disciple within the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Send out all disciples from all sixty four halls.” This order gave Lei Tiangang a big shock, he subconsciously replied, “Sect Master, Ling Yun has committed such a heinous act, he has most likely fled far far away…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No! He’ll definitely come back for more… He definitely will!!” All the blood travelled straight up to Lei Qianfeng’s completely red face. His entire body was shaking, as if every vein on his body might explode at any moment. “Go now! If Ling Yun is not found… then don’t ever come back!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The current Lei Qianfeng had lost all sense of reason. Lei Tiangang didn’t dare to speak any further and immediately left with the order. Soon after, another thunderous roar of anger filled all four corners of the Soul Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Qianfeng’s chest rose up and down violently, heaving like a raging bull. With this atmosphere, no one dared speak another word. After quite a long while, Lei Qianfeng’s breathing started to calm down. He gave another order, “Qiandu, immediately notify Guangqian, Yuanzhe, and the rest in all the branch sects, get them to return to the main sect and have all the branch sect leaders to personally escort them back. Get them to leave now, not a moment later!!”</span></p>

Lei Guangmo’s matter had Lei Qianfeng terrified that Ling Yun would act against his other sons.</span></p>

With the elite sixty four halls being dispatched, the sect was quiet for a while… and then another storm struck.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir Ling Yun, the Soul Sect has sent news of Lei Guangmo’s death.” After reporting this, she remained silent as she really wanted to know what kind of terrifying poison Yun Che had used to kill Lei Guangmo. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This timeline is going according to what I’ve planned. What’s the reaction on the Soul Sect’s side?” Yun Che asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lei Guangmo was Lei Qianfeng’s favorite son. Dying right in front of him from poison has caused him to lose some sense of reason, he actually activated all sixty four halls and all the hall masters, vice hall masters, as well as nearly two million disciples to set up ambushes and traps all around the Soul Sect . He has even activated every defensive profound formation they have.”</span></p>

I suggest that during this period of time, Sir Ling Yun should most definitely not go anywhere near the Soul Sect. These measures they’ve taken are nothing like we’ve ever seen before and cannot be sustained for too long. It’s pretty obvious that these orders were issued when Lei Qianfeng was being impulsive. In a few days time when Lei Qianfeng has somewhat calmed down, we can definitely expect him to retract the order.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the disciples of the sixty four halls only accounted for one quarter of the entire sect’s numbers, they were instead all of its elites. And now that all of them had been sent out, this meant that the greatest threats, including the hall masters and vice hall masters, were no longer in the sect!</span></p>

It strengthened one's soul, granted greater longevity, and allowed one to take the seat of power. In order to possess strong and great profound power, one needed months and years, countless fortuitous encounters, a large amount of cultivation resources, and an endless amount of blood and sweat….</span></p>

Back then, when Yun Che was in the Azure Cloud Continent and had come into the possession of the Sky Poison Pearl, he had deeply recognized this fact.</span></p>

At the same time, since the poison was so terrifying, the pearl had attracted the attention of all the great experts in the Azure Cloud Continent.</span></p>

Even at its greatest heights of usage, if he released all the poison within the pearl, he was unable to kill a Sovereign Profound Realm expert.</span></p>

When it came back, the poisonous abilities slowly started to recover. During this period, he would spend a short amount of time every now and then to investigate the recovery of the poisonous half of the Sky Poison Pearl. Until today, all the poison that had been accumulated… let alone an expert in the divine way… It wouldn’t be enough to kill a normal Overlord.</span></p>

In fact, it should be an existence greater than the True Gods, so much that it was on the same level as the Creation Gods. To be a treasure of such proportions, even if it possessed a little bit of what it should have, it should be so terrifying that it’d be considered heaven defying even in this era...</span></p>
