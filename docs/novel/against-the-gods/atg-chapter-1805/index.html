The Devil Queen of the North beat him back again and again and his hoarse cries and roars of pain filled the air before he finally revealed his true body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The huge crimson dragon let out a soul-shattering roar as it attacked in a maddened frenzy. It looked just like a crazy dragon which had lost its soul… After that, Chi Wuyao streaked past its attacks and dealt incredible blows to it, causing the heavens to rain dragon blood, a shocking sight that no one thought they would ever witness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, the Pure Dragon God was getting relentlessly bombarded by the attacks of the two Witches, and it even ended with her face getting slashed by a blade of black energy. In the end, she finally managed to break away from them and flee with the Crimson Destruction Dragon God in tow, a long trail of blood streaming behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how elaborate or well-reasoned a piece of news was, the impact it imparted could never ever be compared to that of an actual image. These images swiftly spread from the Eastern Divine Region to the rest of the God Realm, and they sent a huge tidal wave crashing down on the still-reeling divine regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The truth being publicly exposed had destroyed everyone’s trust. The consecutive defeats of the Eastern Divine Region and Southern Divine Region had been major blows against their psyche. This image, however, was undoubtedly a fatal blow to the confidence of every single profound practitioner in the God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was doubly true for the ones in the Western Divine Region!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What sort of beings were the Nine Dragon Gods?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were the left and right arms of the Dragon Monarch, the cornerstones of the Dragon God Realm. Their status in the God Realm was so exalted that they stood on equal footing with the god emperors of the other king realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ash Dragon God’s miserable death in the Southern Sea God Realm had sent shockwaves through the entire God Realm and everyone immediately expected the Dragon God Realm’s furious response. But no one had looked down on the Ash Dragon God or expressed any disappointment in him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because the rumors had said that the strongest devils of the Northern Divine Region had accompanied Yun Che to the Southern Sea God Realm. So no matter how strong the Ash Dragon God was, there was nothing he could do if the core forces of the Northern Divine Region had ganged up on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, things were different for the Crimson Destruction Dragon God… The images showed that he and the Devil Queen were engaged in a one-on-one duel and no external forces interfered with their fight. Yet he ended up being abused by the Devil Queen and the fight ended with her drilling a hole through him. He even had to be forcibly dragged away by the Pure Dragon God as she fled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the Pure Dragon God had been completely suppressed by two Witches who were far less famous than she. She could barely even return a blow and it even ended with her receiving a humiliating blow to her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The number one Dragon God had not only lost to the Devil Queen, he had lost in a manner which was devoid of any dignity or grace and the lasting impression he left on everyone was the dragon blood that poured crazily from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eastern Divine Region trembled while the Southern Divine Region shook, and even those devils who were currently quietly moving to the south sank to their knees in awe and wonder when they saw the images being broadcast above them. It was just like when they had all knelt in awe of the majestic power of the Devil Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Western Divine Region, they had descended into a terrifying silence at this very moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though they were the strongest divine region in the God Realm, the Dragon God Realm-led Western Divine Region had been almost indifferent to the invasion of the Northern Divine Region. Even when the Eastern Divine Region’s forces were swept off the board and when the Southern Divine Region’s were turned upside down in a single night, they still believed that the Dragon God Realm was a heavenly moat that the devils simply couldn’t cross.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because the Dragon God Realm was just that powerful. In fact, the Nine Dragon Gods themselves were practically equivalent to nine god emperors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the powerful individuals who inherited memories from their ancestors knew that the head of the Nine Dragon Gods, the Crimson Destruction Dragon God, was a terrifying existence that outstripped all other god emperors, a being second only to the Dragon Monarch himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was this ardent belief that allowed them to face the devils of the Northern Divine Region without even batting an eye. But now, this faith had been cruelly shattered in the most direct and clear manner, in a way that could not be questioned at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the news of this reached the Dragon God Sacred Hall, the expression on every Dragon God’s face turned incomparably somber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the Crimson Destruction Dragon God was fully focused right now, his dragon soul was still being tormented by Chi Wuyao’s devilish incursion. It was hard for him to settle both his mind and soul, his vision immediately went black the moment he landed on the ground. Blood spewed from his mouth and he nearly fainted right there and then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they finally saw the cycling images, all the other Dragon Gods… felt their blood rush crazily to their heads. Their faces alternated between turning as red as blood and as black as the bottom of a wok as they started to breathe heavily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Dragon God could lose or even die, but how could they allow themselves to make such a disgraceful, pathetic, and ugly showing...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the ones who understood the Crimson Destruction Dragon God the best, they could scarcely believe that the frenzied dragon in those images was actually him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had not only lost his own honor and dignity, his actions had also been the equivalent of having all the Dragon Gods suffer countless humiliating slaps across the face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, all the Dragon Gods knew that Chi Wuyao had set this trap so that she could shame the entire dragon god race by association.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She first drew their attention towards the north. Once she found out that it was the Crimson Destruction Dragon God who had been lured in, she immediately formed the second part of her plan. And now, she had sprung her final trap… This unprecedented feeling of humiliation made all the Dragon Gods feel as if shit had literally rained down on their heads!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had been well and truly caught in her web, and in the end, it had resulted in a huge thunderclap being set off in the already shaky God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Despicable… Witch… I will definitely… kill you!” The Crimson Destruction Dragon God growled through broken teeth. His eyes were like a scarlet abyss and every single one of his words was filled with hate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two hundred thousand years of pride and glory had been destroyed in a single day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to brood over it,” the Azure Dragon God comforted him in the calmest voice he could manage. He forcibly suppressed the writhing of his heart before he continued, “This affair will undoubtedly rock the hearts of the Western Divine Region, but it will not affect our Dragon God Realm. Big brother will definitely be able to repay the resentment he feels today ten thousand times over once two months have passed.”</span></p>
