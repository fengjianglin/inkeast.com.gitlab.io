 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You would know but would the rest of the world know?” Xia Qingyue said nearly the exact same words her mother did in a melancholic voice, “From then on, the entire world would know me as the god empress of the Moon God Realm. Even if it was only a hollow title, even if the Star God Emperor did not reveal to all who were present that you and I were husband and wife, even if this matter would never be revealed, would you… truly be able to accept it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che was unable to reply.</span></p>

Today, in front of foster father, you violently beat up two of his sons. Wasn’t the purpose of that to let me see the anger and resentment in your heart?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qingyue… I…”</span></p>

If you were not around, then the title of ‘God Empress’ would merely be an empty one that would allow foster fother and I to realize the desires of our hearts. But since you are still around, then I am still your wife…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On one side were her foster father and mother, on the other side was the Yun Che who had appeared out of nowhere…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, the plan would have gone off without a hitch, but just like how Yue Wugou suddenly regained her memories all those years ago, the heavens had once again played a joke that was both kind and malicious at the same time. Because the Yun Che that she thought was lost to her forever had once again appeared in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had chosen Yun Che… She had not even thought it over, because at that time, her mind had been thrown into complete and utter chaos, and she had basically been unable to consider anything at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even now, she still did not know why she had chosen Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire Eastern Divine Region had gathered there, so it was no longer possible to stop or regret this wedding ceremony. After she had asked the Moon God Emperor for the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace, she had desired to run away by herself, fleeing the title of “God Empress”, and once the Moon God Emperor’s wrath had waned, she would have come back to explain and atone for her sins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when the Star God Emperor had revealed the marriage contract to all who were present and Yun Che had admitted to it as well, she was left with no other choice but to bring Yun Che along with her. Otherwise, the Moon God Emperor would definitely have killed Yun Che when he went berserk with rage—no matter who he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che was severely shaken by this… He had just silently asked himself this question. If Xia Qingyue was not truly going to marry anyone and it was a sham marriage that was true in title and name only, could he actually force himself to accept it? But, on the other side, there was her foster father’s dignity and most important hopes and the final wishes of her very own mother…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet she had chosen him… She abandoned the foster father whom she owed a great debt of gratitude, abandoned her own mother and abandoned the Moon God Realm as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So now, the heart’s blood that stained her moon robes was even more glaring and heart-piercing than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were husband and wife, and they had been since they were sixteen years of age…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now that he thought about it, just what exactly had he done for her over all these years?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had gotten one lover after the other and he had even married Cang Yue after that, and married the Little Demon Empress next… And when had he ever asked her, his proper wife, about these kind of things and when had he ever even spared a single thought for her feelings?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had always thought that Xia Qingyue was focused only on pursuing the profound way and that she had always been keeping a deliberate distance from him, ignoring the relationship they had as husband and wife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was only today that he realized that the person who had truly been ignoring this relationship… had been him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He suddenly found it hard to breathe but Yun Che strode forward and lightly hugged Xia Qingyue from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue’s body gave a slight shudder… but she did not try to struggle free from his embrace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her body still felt ice cold as the torment born from abandoning her foster father and her own mother ravaged her heart, leaving her in an abyss of pain. But, after feeling the reality of Yun Che by her side, her heart began to slowly calm down. She closed her eyes and spoke as if she was talking inside a dream, “These past few years, I have always felt like I was dreaming an illusory dream, that is until… I saw you again…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her sect had met with disaster and in the next instant, she found herself in an completely strange and foreign world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was all alone by herself and every person, every thing, every brush of air, and every grain of sand was foreign to her… She did not know anyone, there was no one to help her or accompany her… Everything that she had in the Profound Sky Continent seemed to have become mere memories, a place that she would never be able to return to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those soft and seemingly insignificant words spoke of a boundless loneliness and sorrow. Even though she had been able to find her mother in this place, and accompany her, she still only had loneliness as her companion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only when Yun Che had appeared that she felt as if she had awoken from the “dream”. In fact, it was to the extent where she actually felt like she was still “alive”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qingyue, after this… you’ll have me for company.” Yun Che quietly hugged her even tighter. “As for what happened this time, I will go back together with you and beg for forgiveness from the Moon God Emperor and your mother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No,” Xia Qingyue shook her head, “I already said that it is not your fault. I alone will return to beg for their forgiveness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you still recognize me as your husband, then if someone must atone for something, then it’s only natural that we atone for our sins as husband and wife,” Yun Che said with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue still shook her head, “Foster father may still forgive me. In fact, he may decide not to take his anger out on you, but… it will not be possible for him to ever forgive you. Your appearance, on the contrary, will only incite his rage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue’s words stunned Yun Che and following that, he lapsed into a heavy silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue was Yue Wugou’s daughter, was his foster daughter. So even though she had committed a colossal mistake, it would still be possible for the Moon God Emperor to forgive her. But what was he, Yun Che, to the Moon God Emperor?</span></p>

So on what basis would he be forgiven by the Moon God Emperor?</span></p>

After that, I will return to the Moon God Realm to beg for Foster Father’s forgiveness… You don’t need to worry about me, foster father has always treated me as if I was his very own, he will not censure me too excessively.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace’s speed was extremely fast, but this golden-colored figure was actually able to slowly close the distance between them.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immediately, the distance was no longer closing between them and in the next instant, they actually began to gradually grow further and further apart.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace was still one of the best profound warships in the entire God Realm, so even when it faced power on the level of a Moon God, it was still able to display outstanding defensive capabilities. Under that golden profound light, the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace shook and trembled, and it was even knocked slightly off-course. But in just a few short breaths, it once again regained its balance and its speed was hardly affected at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the contrary, due to the aftershock, the golden figure was once again left even further in the dust.</span></p>

She muttered in a rather dazed voice, “Foster father’s rage has already abated?”</span></p>

Flying at extreme speed would greatly increase the consumption of its fuel, and the only possible reason for the Golden Moon God to stop his pursuit was due to the Moon God Emperor’s orders. This meant that the “danger” had perhaps resolved itself in advance, and so there was also no longer a need to fly at such an extreme speed and they could ensure that they had enough resources to fly for another forty eight hours.</span></p>

Every time they had met, it was over in an instant. But every time they parted, it would be for months if not years, and there was even one time that they had thought death would separate them forever.</span></p>

In Heavenly Sword Villa, it ended up being a battle between husband and wife. She had chosen to stay in Frozen Cloud Immortal Palace, yet Yun Che had somehow become the first male disciple in Frozen Cloud Immortal Palace’s history. She had been sent to the God Realm and yet even though they had been “parted by death”, they somehow managed to meet again in this vast universe.</span></p>

He started recounting his tale to Xia Qingyue from that point onwards. He told Xia Qingyue about the existence of Jasmine, he also told her about how the Primordial Profound Ark had brought him to the Illusory Demon World and how that led to him finding his real parents and meeting the Little Demon Empress… He then spoke about how he returned to the Profound Sky Continent and saved Frozen Cloud Immortal Palace from calamity…</span></p>

But it was only later that I discovered that she was not the least bit heartless. On the contrary, she was the most pure, warm, and gentle person I had met in my entire life. This time, I have definitely made her worry for me yet again.”</span></p>
