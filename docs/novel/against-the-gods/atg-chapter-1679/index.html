It sounded so dark and sinister that it resembled the low and terrifying moan made by evil spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s a level eight Divine Sovereign.

But he got thrown in here pretty quickly huh… Heehehheh… This truly disappoints this old ghost.”</span></p>

The sound was so harsh and ugly that it caused Yun Che’s heart to spasm as those words entered his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, their auras were far more terrifying than their voices. They were as vast and boundless as the ocean and they radiated a dark oppressive might that was as heavy as ten thousand mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, they had not fully unleashed their auras yet. This was the spiritual pressure that naturally radiated from their bodies. But Yun Che could already tell that these three auras were no weaker than Yan Tianxiao when he had attacked him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No, in fact, two of these people were clearly stronger than him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And Yan Tianxiao was publicly acknowledged as the strongest god emperor in the Northern Divine Region! Chi Wuyao had also mentioned in the soul message that she had sent Yun Che that she was weaker than Yan Tianxiao when it came to cultivation alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were now two auras that exceeded Yan Tianxiao’s aura in strength and the third one seemed no weaker than his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a world-shaking discovery that would rock the Northern Divine Region for a very long time. It even caused Yun Che to pause in amazement. Though it was not fear that was reflected in his eyes after this discovery. It was… an excitement that seemed to burn like a raging fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, they were still old monsters who had inherited the original True Devil blood and basked in this ancient dark yin energy for nearly a million years. They had not disappointed him one bit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rather than not disappointing him, it would be better to call this a pleasant surprise!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if a human reached the very limits of his race, he still would not be able to compare to the emperor of dragons, Long Bai. That was the difference between the two races.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the two stronger Yama Ancestors among this trio were definitely no weaker than the strongest god emperors of the Eastern and Southern Divine Regions, Qianye Fantian and Nan Wansheng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The weakest was no weaker than the Eternal Heaven God Emperor, Zhou Xuzi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a huge amount of power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But alas, in order to attain this power and longevity, they had no choice but to hole up in this place and never see the light of day ever again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Yun Che’s eyes, their lives could not even be compared to the lives of domesticated livestock, much less the god emperors!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack, crack, crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of devil bones being stepped on slowly drew nearer. Yun Che’s gloomy black eyes pierced the darkness and he slowly made out three figures which resembled evil spirits within this gloom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s right, evil spirits!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These three black figures were equally hunched over and withered. Their exposed skin was as ashen as a corpse and it seemed to be wrapped tightly around their shrunken bones. Their four limbs were even more thin and withered than the branches of a truly dead … They barely had any characteristics of a living human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, if they were to lie down on the ground motionless, everyone would believe that these were three withered corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the movement of their withered limbs and the gloomy and hellish light that glinted in their eyes showed that they were still alive! Yes, they resembled three “ghosts” who were actually still alive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yan Wanchi, Yan Wanhun, Yan Wangui.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s lips curved up as he muttered the names of the Three Yama Ancestors under his breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the earliest part of the Northern Divine Region’s history, it was these Three Yama Ancestors who had found the devil blood and Yama Devil Art left behind by the Primordial Yama Devils. They had conquered the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness and established the Yama Realm, a power which would dominate the entire history of the Northern Divine Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their accomplishments and achievements echoed down through the generations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had survived to this day but they had been reduced to these miserable, inhuman shapes. It was pitiful and laughable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three “corpses” came to a halt. The looks in their eyes changed and that far too-terrifying dark oppressive might which they released started to faintly tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been far too long since they had heard their own names.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che slowly raised a hand, his palm facing the three Yama Ancestors. A cluster of black light gently flickered in his hand as he said, “Yun Che… You three had best carve that name into your very souls.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Because that is the name of your future master!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he said those words in a deep voice, they sounded no different than heavenly law pronouncing their judgement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once the three Yama Ancestors heard it, they felt as if someone had injected life and vitality into their souls, souls which had been withered by this interminable darkness. That was because they simply found Yun Che’s words too funny. It was a joke that made them crack up in laughter.</span></p>

The joke they had just heard was practically manna from heaven, causing their shriveled skin to glow with vitality.</span></p>

This name does indeed match the name of the person the kids told us about. The Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor? The Eternal Calamity of Darkness? Killing the Burning Moon God Emperor with a single stroke of his sword? Heeheeheehee… in the end, it was all nothing but crazy talk.”</span></p>

As he flexed his withered fingers, dark energy instantly started to swirl in the air. He stared at Yun Che, those old deep-set eyes that resembled pools of inky darkness narrowed into two terrifying slits. “This little ghost is merely a Divine Sovereign, but he can still remain standing in front of us three old ghosts. Not bad.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heehehheh, since when would a crazy little ghost know the meaning of the word ‘fear’?”</span></p>

Every step he took was accompanied by darkness energy that rippled in the air like violent waves. “Little ghost, we three old ghosts have lived for eight hundred and ninety thousand years, and there hasn’t ever been anyone who has dared to say something so ridiculous and absurd to us… Heeheehee, in fact, it makes me a little reluctant to suck you dry immediately.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The words “ugly” and “repulsive” could not even begin to describe his sinister smile.

Compared to Yan Wanchi’s sinister smile, his smile was filled with a deep derision and pity. “But even three crippled wild dogs can proudly live under the sun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old things who can’t even be compared to wild dogs, you actually holed up in this place for more than eight hundred thousand years?

The pity that was evident in the curl of his lips stabbed into the Three Yama Ancestors’ eyes like a poisoned knife. “You are the three biggest and most pathetic jokes in the history of the Northern Divine Region… Oh no, no, I mean the entire God Realm. Three old bedbugs who were buried in this unbearably noxious place. So where do you even find the shamelessness required to laugh wildly in my face, hmmm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Three Yama Ancestors had lived for an exceedingly long time but their existences had long since become painful to themselves. In fact, it had really become quite pitiful. However, as the Yama Realm’s founding ancestors, level ten Divine Masters who had reached the zenith of darkness profound energy, who would dare to insult them even if they truly could be compared to a bedbug? Who would dare to insult them so!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the founding ancestors of the Yama Realm, all of the Yama Emperors, past and present, had to treat them with the utmost dignity and respect. They did not even dare do anything which would imply disrespect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As practitioners of a negative profound energy, it would normally not be possible for them to be enraged by a few words.</span></p>

Furthermore, Yun Che’s insult was the most humiliating thing they had heard in years and it was aimed directly at their sore spot. There was no doubt it agitated the twisted minds of the Three Yama Ancestors, stirring them up into a frenzy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sssss…. Uwaaaaaaah!” The Three Yama Ancestors shuddered as a frightening black light radiated from their eyes. Wails which did not even sound human ripped from their throats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You damn brat!” Yan Wanchi slashed the air with a clawed hand as he howled, “Aren’t you a little too eager to die!!?”</span></p>

Just look at your ugly appearances right now. It looks like even comparing you to bedbugs was doing you a favor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heeaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!” The old ghost on the right—second of the Three Yama Ancestors, Yan Wanhun, could no longer hold back any longer.

A muffled groan leaked from Yun Che’s lips as he was instantly hurt by Yan Wanhun’s wild attacks. An arrow of blood shot from his mouth as he tumbled through the air but Yan Wanhun was already rushing toward him like a ghostly shadow. He moved so fast that he left sonic booms trailing in his wake. As he darted toward Yun Che, he swiped out a clawed hand.</span></p>
