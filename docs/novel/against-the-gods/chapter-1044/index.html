But the moment he unleashed his profound energy, he suddenly noticed that the scenery before his eyes was falling swiftly for some reason. Then, everything turned gray white before sinking into darkness...</span></p>

The burst of profound energy caused scarlet blood to gush out of his severed neck like a fountain and sent the head flying dozens of meters away from the torso. Finally, it fell weakly and smashed into the snow next to Mu Heng’s feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Yizhou’s expression was very calm because he never got the chance to show fear on his face. The only things that showed the fear and shock he was feeling during his last moments were his enlarging pupils.</span></p>

He stumbled backwards in great fear and nearly fell on his butt during the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che had hidden his body and his aura, detonated the profound energy in his Buddha Heart Divine Veins in an instant, moved at an impossible speed, and finally cut through Mu Yizhou’s neck with the Cloud Butterfly Blade… The assassination wouldn’t have been possible without any one of this elements and he had executed them all to perfection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, Yun Che at who was at the first level of the Divine Origin Realm was able to kill Mu Yizhou in an instant, a profound practitioner who was almost two realms stronger than he was!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took the Cloud Butterfly Blade only a brief instant to pass through Mu Yizhou’s neck and the entire assassination process was so quiet that Mu Yizhou never even realized that he was killed until the final moment. In fact, he never learned how he had died at Yun Che’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s… that’s the Cloud Butterfly Blade!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? You know it?” Yun Che withdrew the Cloud Butterfly Blade with a bit of astonishment. Although this person was far weaker than Mu Yizhou—he was probably just a normal Ice Phoenix Palace disciple—he actually recognized the Cloud Butterfly Blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would appear that the Cloud Butterfly Blade was extremely famous in the Snow Song Realm.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only now that Mu Yizhou’s headless body finally collapsed to the ground, spraying the floor with a shocking amount of blood. Judging from the sprayed blood, there was probably nothing left inside the body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, do you want to leave or do you want to be… buried along with your senior brother?” Yun Che asked coldly. There was no reason to believe that a person who was exiled to</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">this place was a good egg but at the same time they shared no relations or grudges with each other. In a place like Mist End Valley, it was better to avoid unnecessary trouble. Therefore, he wouldn’t waste energy trying to kill this guy if he did choose to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Heng’s took a few steps backwards but he quickly came to a stop once more. The initial fear and shock on his face were actually giving away to fierce ruthlessness, “You only killed Mu Yizhou because you ambushed him using the Cloud Butterfly Blade. Do you really think a mere Divine Origin Realm profound practitioner like you has the right to boast of his strength before me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s eyes narrowed, “So you choose to die, is that it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Me? The one who will die is you!” Mu Heng’s face turned slightly distorted, “I’m going to die sooner or later anyway in this place! If I can drag you, the sect master’s direct disciple into death with me, hehehe, then my death will be totally worth it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mn.” Yun Che nodded in agreement, “It is a pretty good idea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he was still an Ice Phoenix Palace disciple, he wouldn’t dare show Yun Che even a bit of disrespect even if he had all the courage in the world. But he was a fugitive in Mist End Valley, so Yun Che’s identity only invoked irritation and excitement in his twisted heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then die!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Heng swung his sword at Yun Che, causing bone chilling air to enshroud Yun Che in an instant. He looked like he would freeze Yun Che in ice right there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che raised his arms in front of himself with the Heaven Smiting Sword clutched firmly in his hands. His eyes turned gloomy as he detonated his profound energy, flames and sword force at once. Judging from the strength of Mu Heng’s aura, he was probably around the second or third level of the Divine Soul Realm. Although he was far weaker than Mu Yizhou, he still wasn’t an easy opponent for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thankfully, Mu Heng’s whole life in Mist End Valley was spent running just one step ahead of certain death. Not only was he hurt all over, his vitality was weak and his profound strength was largely depleted. There was no reason for him to lose if he were to fight Mu Heng with full force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che braved the cold wind and leaped into the air, instantly arriving in front of Mu Heng. His sword fell on Mu Heng’s head, as though it would flatten him like a pie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s speed immensely shocked Mu Heng but he raised his own sword immediately afterwards, his profound energy surging. He had complete confidence that his slash would deal Yun Che a grievous blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang! A heavy sound resounded as Yun Che was knocked far, far away from the point of impact. However, Mu Heng’s sword was the one that broke as his hands turned numb and his feet sank deeply into the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!?” Mu Heng’s pupils contracted abruptly as fear and shock appeared on his face, “How… how is this possible!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before him, an oppressive feeling that shouldn’t belong to one at the Divine Origin Realm rushed towards him. Yun Che actually recovered with a roll through the air and swung his sword once more down toward his head. The flames enveloping the sword were actually stronger than during the first clash and threatened to suffocate Mu Heng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Heng clenched his teeth and threw away the broken sword he was wielding. Not daring to conserve his strength any longer, his entire body glowed icily as he roared and sent thirteen icicles stabbing into the air from the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thirteen icicles had appeared swiftly and unexpectedly, so Yun Che’s falling figure was instantly stabbed by two of the thirteen icicles at the same time. Mu Heng was just about to let loose a peal of mad laughter when he suddenly realized that the pierced “Yun Che” was dissipating swiftly into a cloud of thin ice mist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind Mu Heng, a calamitous, burning power rushed ruthlessly towards his back. The only thing the he could do was to scream in terror before he was struck mercilessly by the attack.</span></p>

Mu Heng flew far, far away into the distance like a broken bag of blood before he crashed painfully into the frozen rock Yun Che was hiding inside earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was impossible for Mu Heng to stand up again after his spine was snapped in half. He wriggled painfully on the ground while continuously vomiting scarlet blood from his mouth.</span></p>

A dangerous aura swiftly approached towards Mu Heng.</span></p>

Putting away his sword swiftly, Yun Che withdrew his aura and escaped leisurely from the place, not bothering to spare Mu Heng even a second glance. After he moved a few hundred meters away from the place, he jumped soundlessly into the air and landed on top of a tall, dry tree. His figure slowly vanished after that.</span></p>

When the time was up, the dimensional profound formation Mu Xuanyin left on Yun Che’s body would teleport him away from Mist End Valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cloud of thick mist scattered as Mu Xuanyin soundlessly appeared above Mist End Valley once more. She quickly spotted Yun Che after she spread her consciousness across the land. Then, her eyebrows became wrinkled a little.</span></p>

However, that wasn’t why Mu Xuanyin was surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Xuanyin was surprised because Yun Che was obviously moving slowly across the ground!</span></p>

Although he had used it for less than a day only, it was without a doubt a large improvement compared to the time when he wasn’t able to move at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he was able to move while being invisible, naturally Yun Che didn’t need to hide in the same place any longer. Instead, he started roaming around Mist End Valley and enjoying its unique scenery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, he was enjoying the scenery of Mist End Valley...</span></p>

While it was true that the profound beasts couldn’t see him, they could unwittingly send a wave of profound energy in his direction and… reveal him instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Xuanyin watched as Yun Che strolled through layer upon layer of thick mists and past many violent profound beasts. He made it look so simple it was as if he was the only thing to exist in Mist End Valley. His temporary exile was supposed to be a severe punishment and test of his abilities but right now he looked like he was on a vacation or something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just like the time he travelled to the Ice Wind Empire alone three months ago!</span></p>

But just when Mu Xuanyin withdrew her gaze and got ready to leave, her eyes suddenly caught a glimpse of something. She said softly to herself, “The Feathered Ice Spirit Flower?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s footsteps had paused because an extremely dangerous aura was brimming ahead of him. Moreover, it was the most dangerous aura he had ever sensed since he entered Mist End Valley. When he came close to this intimidating aura, he could clearly sense some of the hair on the back of his neck standing on end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze penetrated the thick mist and very soon he saw a huge, white figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This white figure was thirty meters tall and it had the outline of a giant ape. It was completely white in color but the color wasn’t like the snow white color of thick hair. Instead, it was an icy white color that gleamed intimidatingly even through the thick mist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ape wasn’t covered in hair but a layer of thick ice armor! Yun Che only needed to look at the light reflecting off its armor to guess just how tough it must be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Worse, this giant ice armored ape wasn’t weaker than Mu Hanyi at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This also meant that its strength was the equivalent a human cultivator in the middle stage of the Divine Tribulation Realm… or the late stage even!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che stopped his breathing and slowed down his footsteps, backing away from the ape little by little. Although the giant ice armored ape seemed to be deeply asleep and he was currently invisible and undetectable by aura, he still acted with extreme caution. After all, the consequences of being discovered were unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could barely escape from the peak Divine Soul Realm Mu Yizhou.</span></p>

Even the chance of escaping was miniscule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder this particular area was so quiet and devoid of profound beasts. It was the territory of a Divine Tribulation Realm beast… naturally, there were no profound beasts that dared to approach it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when he was about to turn away and leave, a strange, white gleam suddenly caught his full attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Less than ten meters away from the giant ice armored ape, a beautiful white flower lay quietly in full bloom. It was completely icy white in color and the single flower above the stem looked so pure it was almost unreal. Its feather-like petals swayed to the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strange spirit energy filled the surrounding space and it was clear and rich despite the giant ice armored ape’s terrifying aura. It was only then that Yun Che realized that the spirit energy had come from this strange flower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only natural for a flower in Mist End Valley to be icy and cold. But not only did this flower’s spirit energy not make him feel cold at all, it even warmed his heart for a very, very long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che stared fixedly at this strange white flower, so much so that he even forgot to move away from the giant ape. He had seen countless strange flowers and herbs in his life but there were very few that could strike a deep chord in his heart.</span></p>
