She kept trying to clench her teeth or bite down on her lower lip, but nothing worked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, don’t cry, don’t cry,” Yun Che consoled her in a soft and gentle voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It hadn’t been an easy task for Shui Meiyin to stop his tears, but now, she suddenly ended up crying herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I… I… Wuuuuuu…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che didn’t say anything else, he only hugged her tightly… and he wouldn’t let her go ever again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that Shui Meiyin was also giving vent to her emotions. She had been keeping them bottled up in her heart all this while, and there was no way she could confide in anyone else either. It must have been a huge burden and torture for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, every single teardrop that was falling from her eyes right now was shed because of him and for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She cried for a full fifteen minutes before she finally managed to stop her weeping. However, when she turned her delicate head up to look at Yun Che, her starry eyes were still filled with tears that had yet to fall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he bent his head to stare straight into Shui Meiyin’s reddened eyes, he chuckled to himself and said, “If your big sister were to see you now, she’d definitely come straight at me with her Jade Rivulet Sword.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, my big sister is really gentle! There’s no way she’d do that. Haha!” Shui Meiyin protested as she giggled. “Besides, you’re the grand and mighty Devil Master, who would dare to swing a sword at you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her fingers lightly tapped against Yun Che’s chest as she said with teary eyes, “However, Big Brother Yun Che’s chest has become really warm now. It’s not like a cold block of ice anymore. That’s the reason why… I wasn’t willing to let go. Hee hee.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che himself could very clearly sense that his blood was no longer as cold as ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But…” Shui Meiyin’s finger suddenly stopped tapping his chest, as it gently nestled against his robes. She spoke in a soft and gentle voice, “Big Brother Yun Che, you can only give this warmth to me and the people that you care about. As for your enemies and the threats that you must eliminate, you must still be the pitiless and cruel Devil Master, okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Yun Che gave a heavy nod of his head. “This was also one of the reasons why you were so conflicted with your decision, correct?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Meiyin’s voice fell to a hush as she continued, “I had originally wanted to tell you everything after you beat the Dragon God Realm and cleaned up all of the remaining threats.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I was afraid that if I told you too soon, you would start acting rashly and end up exposing the Blue Pole Star to danger. I was also afraid that your hatred and resentment would disperse once you found out, and you wouldn’t be as ruthless as you used to be. I was even afraid that your worries and attachments would start to mess with your decision-making process…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, the method you used to deal with the Southern Sea God Realm caused my blood to run cold. Furthermore, your order to attack the Dragon God Realm was far too reckless and sudden… I was convinced that your confidence and determination to face the Dragon God Realm was due to some extremely cruel method you possessed. A method that would exact an equally cruel price on yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che was unable to deny those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand,” Yun Che said with a heart filled with guilt. “Don’t you worry, whether it’s the Dragon God Realm or the Western Divine Region, I will do my very best to protect myself while fighting them… I will no longer take such dangerous risks anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that it had come to this, he obviously understood why Shui Meiyin had wanted to tell him everything before he launched that attack on the Dragon God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She hoped that he would stop recklessly putting his life on the line once he saw the Blue Pole Star again, and that he would start thinking about his own self-preservation once more so that he could reunite with them once everything was over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Meiyin still ended up conflicted about whether she should tell him even when they were about to leave the Seven Star Realm, and their encounter with Jin Yue had clearly made her lean toward continuing to hide it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, fate had decided that they would meet Xia Yuanba, who had come to the God Realm to find Yun Che, today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if it is to use the rest of my life to repay my little Meiyin, I will make sure that I’ll live a good, long life from now on,” Yun Che said in a half-joking manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Meiyin looked at him pensively before suddenly saying, “Big Brother Yun Che, if… if you really want to repay me, can… can you just promise me three things?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che was taken aback by the request at first, but when he looked into Shui Meiyin’s starry eyes, which were trembling with a strange light, he slowly nodded his head and said in an extremely serious voice, “Alright, I’ll agree to anything, no matter what it is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an extremely solemn vow that he had made from his heart, because the debt he owed Shui Meiyin was far too great. Even if he slaved away his entire life, he wouldn’t ever be able to repay it, so what were three small promises?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Meiyin wiped away the tears on her face as her expression turned solemn as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The first thing I want Big Brother Yun Che to promise me… is that no matter what you encounter in the future, even if it is more dreadful than the traumatic events of the past, even if it plunges you into an even deeper despair, you must… must be kind to yourself. Don’t ever allow your hatred and resentment to harm you… and cause you to risk your life in hopes that you will die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Because…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Meiyin, who had just calmed down a moment ago, started to crinkle her nose again as tears welled up in her eyes. “Your life and your wellbeing no longer belong to you alone. In this world, there is someone… who cares about you… and loves you… far more than you could ever imagine. For your sake, she truly was able to… give up everything… everything for you… Even… even…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if it is for the sake of not letting h… them down, you can never… throw yourself into that deep abyss again.

He stretched out a hand to gently brush away the remaining tears on the girl’s face. After that, he said in a gentle but solemn voice, “Alright. I will remember every single word that you just said.

Though they do not fear battle, they have never been the instigators of war. As a result, they’ve never used power to plunder others, despite the fact that they could easily do so. The other king realms also had no choice but to curb their own excesses and tyranny since the Dragon God Realm ruled over them with a watchful eye.”</span></p>

They are all things that have to come to pass. But…” She affectionately looked at Yun Che. “I believe that, in a future not so far from now, Big Brother Yun Che, who will have become the new sovereign of the universe, will do an even better job than the Dragon God Realm, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che slowly stretched out a hand and stared at his own palm.</span></p>

However, he had also met Chu Yuechan and Yun Wuxin, which helped him step out from the gloom and into a never ending light...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back when Yun Wuxin had sacrificed her own talent and risked her life to save him, he had stared at his hands just like this and vowed to never again stain those hands which he used to hug and protect his daughter in blood and sin.</span></p>

Warmth and kindness had taken hold of his heart and soul, and he had even felt revulsion towards his past actions. Sin and bloodshed used to be a regular part of his lifestyle, but he began to reject them wholesale as the hatred, malice, resentment, and violence in his heart unconsciously started to wither away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One memory struck him at this moment. When he had returned to the God Realm, Xia Qingyue had pinned him down with a single question. “Did your heart become soft because of your daughter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not too long after that happened, his heart went to the other extreme… and it went to the most extreme of extremes.</span></p>
