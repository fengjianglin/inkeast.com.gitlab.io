On the shore of the lake, Mu Xuanyin and Yun Che were standing facing each other with some distance between them. Although both of them were dressed in snow-white robes, Yun Che’s might and existence seemed insignificant before the aura that was being silently emitted by Mu Xuanyin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yesterday was the last time for rest and reorganization and today, was the beginning of hard training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let Master have a look at your peak condition. There is no need to hold back your abilities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Yun Che heard Mu Xuanyin’s words, profound energy suddenly erupted from his body and Heretic God’s Gates were instantly opened in succession—Heretic Soul—Burning Heart—Purgatory. His profound aura turned from colorless to pale red and after a brief period, it forcibly broke through the shackles with a loud rumble, as it experienced a qualitative change and the color turned as scarlet as fresh blood. His originally calm and stable profound energy abruptly became agitated, like a savage beast that had been infuriated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similar agitation could be seen in Yun Che’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Xuanyin slightly raised her brows as she said indifferently, “Attack.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haah!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che let out a loud roar. He took out the Heaven Smiting Sword and the profound energy that was running wild within his body crazily gushed over the blade. Golden Crow Flames and Phoenix Flames began burning at the same time as flaming sword beam more than ten meters long shot out from the Heaven Smiting Sword. Then, he unleashed “Destroying Heaven Decimating Earth” in Mu Xuanyin’s direction, while howling at the top of his lungs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The airflow of the Heavenly Lake was thrown into disorder, scaring the ice spirits who flew away at quite a fast speed. Yun Che appeared like a volcano shooting up its contents without any previous sign… However, when the Heaven Smiting Sword was still more than thirty meters away from reaching Mu Xuanyin, the storm of his greatly boosted and terrifying profound strength disappeared without any trace in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s body as well as his sword were restrained in the air. It seemed as though the greatly boosted power within him had been completely sucked away by an invisible black hole. There was just nothing of it left in him and he couldn’t even hear the least bit sound of his previously surging power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of him was Mu Xuanyin quietly standing in place. Her eyes had a deep and chilly look in them and her snow-white robe gave off a calm and desolate feeling. She hadn’t moved so much as a muscle the whole time and didn’t release the least bit of her profound energy, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che fell down from the air with a stupefied expression on his face and then stared blankly at her for a good while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His peak strength before Mu Xuanyin was truly like a grain of salt before a sea. It couldn’t even be considered low and petty in comparison, as the difference between the two was unimaginably huge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not bad.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was simply no change in the look of Mu Xuanyin’s eyes but she favorably appraised his strength. Afterwards, she slowly lifted her right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still in a daze, Yun Che sensed a fatal danger all of a sudden. His body instinctively reacted and instantly moved away from the place by employing Star God’s Broken Shadow. But five cold streaks of light, that he couldn’t notice with naked eyes, shot out of the void towards him and struck directly on his real body that had retreated just a second ago. There wasn’t even one of them that targeted his five illusory images.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pfft!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the five cold streaks of light immediately came to a halt after coming in contact with his body and subsequently dissipated, Yun Che’s heart spasmed for a while as cold sweat completely drenched him. The reason was none other than the fact that any one of those streaks was enough to put him to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cold energy had already made contact with his body by the time he sensed it approaching—and it was even after he used Star Gods Broken Shadow to flash out of its way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che let out a long breath as he raised his head but Mu Xuanyin was no longer present in front of him. He quickly turned around as his gaze swept over the surroundings but he didn’t catch sight of even her shadow. When his gaze once more returned to the front, he actually saw Mu Xuanyin before his eyes, standing less than ten steps away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The abundance of your profound energy far surpasses practitioners of same level and its explosiveness is satisfactory. This should be due to the power of the Heretic God,” Mu Xuanyin coldly said, staring at Yun Che’s eyes. “But you are severely lacking the most important thing, sensation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sensation?” Yun Che blanked for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Follow me to a place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Xuanyin lightly swept out her palm, causing the space ahead to tear apart without a sound. Before Yun Che could react to it, his body was sucked into the crack in space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For an instant, his vision turned blurred and bright and then he found himself in another world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lower altitude was completely covered in fog, which was incomparably pale in color as well as dense. It was impossible for an ordinary fog to obstruct Yun Che’s line of sight but he couldn’t even see the things three hundred meters away due to the presence of the dense fog. Upon exerting his all power to look into the distance, he could barely make out snow-covered mountains of various heights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also a huge sealing profound formation less than thirty meters from him emitting a cold shine like ice-crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This place is called the Mist End Valley, where the disciples who make big mistakes are sent to be disciplined. If a disciple commits an unforgivable sin, they are thrown into this valley to let them perish on their own. Such disciples would always end up dying a very fast and miserable death, with no exceptions to this day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was obviously not possible for the cold energy here to be as threatening as the Heavenly Netherfrost Lake but the whistling chilly wind blowing in the place carried a heart-palpating eeriness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s heart thumped loudly. He asked in a probing tone, “Master, don’t tell me you brought the disciple here to…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since it was called the “Valley of Death,” there was naturally something amiss about the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A large number of profound beasts are born in the Mist End Valley but they are completely different from those you have seen in the Ice Phoenix Region. The profound beasts that are born in an environment like the Mist End Valley are basically all incomparably brutal in nature. They don’t even hesitate to slaughter their own kind, to say nothing of beings of other species. Every profound beast you come across in the valley will go after your life right away. The weakest of them is at the same level as the Winterfrost Direwolf you have seen and the strongest ones are comparable to the profound practitioners of in the Divine Tribulation Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“…” Yun Che’s eyes revealed a shocked look. Listening up to here, he had already guessed Mu Xuanyin’s intention behind bringing him to the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In addition, the ones you’ll be confronting are not only the profound beasts. There are also some former Ice Phoenix disciples in there, who have been sent inside not that long ago and are still alive even after facing the constant assault of the brutal profound beasts. The disciples who can survive in such a condition should at least the early to mid stage of the Divine Soul Realm. Even those at the Divine Tribulation Realm will be present among them. As a group of people who are bound to die, sooner or later, they wouldn’t spare any means to live on as long as possible. Hence, they are far more fearsome than the brutal profound beasts.

Hearing Mu Xuanyin’s description of the Mist End Valley, he fully understood that it would be no different from having a death wish, if he were to enter the valley with his current strength.</span></p>

Even though he had been practicing all this time, the strength of his profound power was still almost the same as when he had just broken through to the Divine Origin Realm. It was unknown whether he could even have a breakthrough to the second level of the Divine Origin Realm in the six months and even if he could… it would still be no different from having a death wish to enter the danger-filled Mist End Valley, due to the presence of the many Divine Soul Realm and even Divine Tribulation Realm brutal beasts as well as profound practitioners.</span></p>

In a flash, the Heaven Smiting Sword appeared in his hand and its whole blade burned with flames. Then, he thrust forth with all he had, to counter the snowflake drifting in the air.</span></p>

The backlash of Heretic God’s power had led to the collapse and breakdown of his meridians, with the most miserable instance being that time when close to half of his meridians were snapped… However, this was the first time that each and every meridian in his body was snapped.</span></p>

There was a pond at the central area of this icy world, that was only a bit over thirty square meters in area. The water of the pond was clear as a mirror and at its center was a snow lotus which was blooming proudly at this very moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This snow lotus was several times bigger than an ordinary one and every one of its overlapped petals was the size of a palm. It not only looked exceptionally pure, beautiful and flawless, it was also shining with a faint, blue and translucent light.</span></p>

They were truly dazzling to the eye. At first glance, no one would think of it as something that had naturally grown and instead consider it an ice-crystal that had been carved in such a way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Xuanyin flung her arm, throwing Yun Che’s body into the water. Her gaze fell on the ice lotus at the center and her snow-like finger lightly pointed in its direction.</span></p>

Afterwards, it slowly dissipated, following the light movements of Mu Xuanyin’s finger.</span></p>

She came to the edge of the pond and moved her finger in a circular motion. A petal of snow lotus flew out and fell into her palm. Then, she placed it on Yun Che’s chest to cover the injured area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">CLANG!!</span></p>

It was because Mu Xuanyin had channeled nearly seventy percent of her profound power in the extremely brief time of an instant. The highest level power in the Primal Chaos blended into the petal of the snow lotus before slowly permeating Yun Che’s body… The snow-white petal at once glowed with incomparably blinding white rays of light. Under the influence of the white rays, Yun Che’s body got wrapped in a brilliantly shining white layer. Subsequently, several streaks of faint white rays started to emanate from his body, which increasingly grew in number and spread throughout his body in no time.</span></p>

Ultimately, they completely disappeared as if they had atomized.</span></p>

As for the white rays originating from within Yun Che’s meridians, that were none other than the rays of light that had permeated his body earlier, they were visibly and gradually connecting his meridians and merging with them…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time the white rays of light fully dissipated without a trace, Yun Che’s thoroughly snapped meridians had perfectly recovered; no damage was left at this point in time… Moreover, if one could see through his body, they would clearly notice that all his meridians were giving off a bizarre icy and magnificent luster.</span></p>
