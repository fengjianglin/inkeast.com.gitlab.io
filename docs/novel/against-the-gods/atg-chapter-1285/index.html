He had taken countless concubines yet he had never made anyone his empress. This continued until that one fateful year. It was about a century ago when he was traipsing through a middle star realm that he met a girl that stole away his heart and his soul at first sight.”</span></p>

He had originally thought that it was just a passing fancy, but the closer he got to that girl, the more deeply he was drawn in and so it was like this as a few days passed… as more than ten days passed… as several months passed… but he was unwilling to leave.”</span></p>

But all that he was had also deeply mesmerized the girl. The two of them had fallen in love with each other, and it was an extremely deep and shared love…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was also from that moment forward that foster father has not taken another concubine… until now.”</span></p>

He stared at side profile of Xia Qingyue’s face, a sight so beautiful that it could take one’s breath away, as he quietly listened to her give her dreamlike recount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had already guessed the identity of the “girl” Xia Qingyue was talking about.</span></p>

Because the two youngest sons of the Moon God Emperor—Yue Huan and Yue Jinxi were already more than one hundred years old. This also meant that not only had the Moon God Emperor not taken any new concubines, it was very likely that he had not even touched any other woman from that moment onwards…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The two of them had stayed together for several decades before they discovered each other’s greatest secret… She found out that foster father was the Moon God Emperor and foster father found out she actually had the ‘Divine Stainless Body’ that would shock the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Yue Wugou after all… Yun Che softly muttered in his heart.</span></p>

Rather, it was only after he had fallen in love with her that he found out about her possessing the Divine Stainless Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After that, foster father brought her back to the Moon God Realm and grandly announced to the entire universe that he would make her his Moon God Empress.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was just that appointing a god empress is far from normal. As the emperor of the Moon God Realm, he could take concubines as he pleased, but the Moon God Empress was not a person that belonged solely to him. It was something that concerned the dignity and prestige of the entire Moon God Realm. If it was just a normal girl from a middle star realm who was forcibly made empress, the entire Moon God Realm would definitely object. So foster father made public the matter regarding her Divine Stainless Body and also gave her the name ‘Yue Wugou’.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che felt his heart wrench… So it turns out that the Moon God Emperor had not announced to the world that he was going to make a girl who possessed the ‘Divine Stainless Body’ his empress because of glory, it was because… he had no choice but to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was not a god emperor that belonged solely to himself, he was the god emperor of the entire Moon God Realm.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che was stunned for a moment but he replied after some consideration, “Could it be that it was not only because… of her Divine Stainless Body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue lightly shook her head, “The world thought that the name ‘Yue Wugou’ was only due to the fact that she possessed the Divine Stainless Body. But they did not know that the word Wugou was foster father telling her that his feelings for her were stainless and pure, and that there was nothing staining or polluting them. He wanted to make her his empress purely because of who she was, and not because of her Divine Stainless Body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che, “...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Foster father’s name is ‘Yue Wuya’, so when the both of them combined their names, it turns into the words ‘stainless and boundless’. It meant that their feelings for each other were not contaminated by anything else and that there would never be a limit to their love.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stainless and boundless… Yun Che’s heart was deeply moved by those words. To think that the Moon God Emperor and Yue Wugou actually shared such a deep love in the past and their union actually had nothing to do with the labels “God Emperor” and “Divine Stainless Body”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in the eyes of the world, the only reason for the Moon God Emperor to make a girl who had been born in a middle star realm his empress, was precisely because of that “Divine Stainless Body”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this was something understandable as well. After all, the people of this world would only be willing to operate on their own perception and understanding of things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just that if this was the case, then the “tragedy” that happened later would definitely have caused far greater harm to the Moon God Emperor than anyone else could imagine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for what happened next, perhaps… you’ve already heard of it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qinyue’s chest lightly rose and fell. All those years ago, it could be said that the “scandal” of the Moon God Realm had engulfed the entire God Realm. Moreover, while the rest of them were gleefully discussing this “scandal”, fully indulging their sense of schadenfreude as they sneered and mocked the Moon God Realm behind its back, they were mocking the pain and despair of her friends, family, and the person she held most dear to her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che nodded his head. But even though he had listened to this point, he still did not understand just why Xia Qingyue wanted to recount such a tale. Furthermore, why she did she know it in such great detail?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Foster father constructed the God Empress Palace for Yue Wugou, he also invited everyone under heaven to the ceremony. All in order to give her the most lavish and grand ceremony to crown her empress. It was… just ten days away from their wedding ceremony that Yue Wugou returned to the star realm she was born in so that she could personally bring her parents to the Moon God Realm, but while they were on their way there, they were despicably ambushed by someone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At that time, in order to protect Yu Wugou thoroughly, foster father had not only dispatched a large amount of moon guards, he had even sent two strong divine moon envoys to accompany her… But those ambushers were far too dreadful, all of the moon guards and even the envoys lost their lives in that attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The divine moon envoys were existences that were only inferior to the Moon Gods themselves. In order to be named a divine moon envoy, one must become a Divine Master first. Within the vast Moon God Realm, there were currently only thirty-six divine moon envoys.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Defeating and killing were two completely different notions altogether. To be able to kill two divine moon envoys in that attack, one had to be at least a powerhouse at the level of a Star God, Moon God, or guardian and it was very possible that there was more than one of them among the assailants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, this could only have been done by a king realm. Moreover, the king realm with the most motivation and reason to do such a thing was the Star God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The clearly irrational and crazed vengeance of the Moon God Emperor that came after that was also directed at the Star God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was for this reason that Jasmine’s mother had died…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They had originally intended to capture Yue Wugou alive, but Yue Wugou had many of the best protective treasures of the Moon God Realm on her person, so she escaped their grasp many times and she had nearly given them the slip a few times. In the end, their intent to capture turned into an intent to kill… But the blow that should have ended her life was blocked by the ‘Moon Heart Plate’ the Moon God Emperor had personally fitted over her chest. Furthermore, within the Moon Heart Plate, was a Void Illusion Stone.”</span></p>

Furthermore, after the “Moon Heart Plate” had been shattered, there was still a Void Illusion Stone that lay within.</span></p>

Otherwise, if it was a normal dimensional stone or dimensional profound device, it would definitely be easy to trace and follow.</span></p>

A slap of her hand would destroy several Mighty Heavenly Sword Regions and Sun Moon Divine Halls. So why had no one heard of such a personage appearing in the Profound Sky Continent?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, she was in such a deep mutual love with the Moon God Emperor at that time that they had coined the term “stainless and boundless” for themselves, so why would she have shacked up with another man and even had children with him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue continued her story, “Even though the Moon Heart Plate saved her life, that villain’s strength was simply far too great. She sustained serious injuries and she had already fainted when she was being sent away by that Void Illusion Stone… In addition to this, she had also lost all of her profound strength and memories.”</span></p>

At that time, Mu Bingyun had also suffered heavy injuries while being afflicted by a virulent poison. She had lost all of her powers and memories and after that she had slowly and steadily recovered, establishing Frozen Cloud Immortal Palace during that period of time.</span></p>

One’s brain could also be shaken so severely that it would cause one’s memories to either be lost or thrown into chaos… Whether it was Mu Bingyun or Yue Wugou, they had both suffered nearly fatal injuries all those years ago, so losing one’s profound strength and memories temporarily did not seem too big a coincidence.</span></p>

One possessed the world-shocking “Heart of Glazed Glass” and “Nine Profound Exquisite Body”, while the other possessed the “Tyrannical Emperor’s Divine Veins”. As it turns out, this was actually because they were the progeny spawned from the “Divine Stainless Body”.</span></p>
