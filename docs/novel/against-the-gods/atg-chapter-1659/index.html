 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Northern Divine Region, the Moon Eaters, Yama Devils, and Witches were existences that were inferior only to the god emperors themselves. They were people that the world could normally only admire from afar and offending them was the same as offending the mighty heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only people who just barely had the right to look down on them were the three emperors of the Northern Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If anyone but the Devil Queen had dared to say such words, if there had been another lesser being foolish enough to speak such nonsense, they would have been cut in two on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Burning Moon God Emperor’s smile vanished swiftly as his eyebrows knitted together slightly. “Why would the Devil Queen say such a thing? Could it be… that you feel that the talent of this king’s foster son is only ordinary?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” A doubtful look crossed Chi Wuyao’s face as she asked, “Could it be that the Burning Moon God Emperor thinks that his foster son’s talent is laudable? Could it be that the Burning Moon God Emperor has not only emptied his body but also his mind on women over the last few years?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao had mocked him in a way that bordered on humiliation, but the Burning Moon God Emperor responded with a hearty laugh instead. He could sense that Chi Wuyao was trying to deliberately provoke him, so… he chose to keep his cool to spite her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even though we haven’t met in years, I’m surprised that the Devil Queen has grown so fond of jokes,” the Burning Moon God Emperor said as he leaned back. His eyes seemed to drift unintentionally toward Witch Chanyi who was quietly standing behind Chi Wuyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Devil Queen’s devilish might is as high as the heavens and I’m afraid that no one in this universe can truly catch your eye. However… Daopian received the Burning Moon divine power at around the same time as your newest Witch, the Ninth Witch. Yet, his cultivation is nearly half a level higher.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If Daopian’s talent is merely ordinary, then this Witch, someone under the Devil Queen’s command, is so talentless that it is hard to watch, no? Is the Devil Queen trying to mock herself with those words?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The calm and collected words of the Burning Moon Devil Emperor instantly quelled the rage in the Moon Eaters’ hearts. The respect and deference in their eyes when they looked at Chi Wuyao had now been partially replaced by a mocking derision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was rumored that the Soul Stealing Devil Queen was as frightful as a demon and there was no one in this universe who did not fear her. But now that she had appeared before them, she had actually smashed her own foot with the rock she was trying to lob at someone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She did not seem like anything special right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao gave a dry chuckle. “When it comes to telling jokes, this queen has no choice but to concede defeat in the presence of the Burning Moon God Emperor. What does cultivation have to do with talent? Even though this queen’s Chanyi would not dare proclaim that her talent is unrivaled, she isn’t someone your newly adopted foster son, who doesn’t even share your surname, can compare to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the Burning Moon God Emperor could even open his mouth, Ji Daopian’s head had already jerked up as he said, “Your Highness, this junior respects you as a senior so I dare not be impolite. However, as one of the Moon Eaters, I won’t allow you to maliciously trample all over our name! Even if you are the Devil Queen!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a Moon Eater ensconced in Burning Moon Royal City, he had the qualifications to confront any opponent, even the Devil Queen herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao indolently looked toward him as her lips curved mockingly. “Maliciously trample all over your name? Do you think you’re even worthy of that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chanyi.” She suddenly gave a command before she continued in a languid voice, “This is the first time you’ve visited the Burning Moon Realm. Since you’ve come all this way, you should take the chance to exchange pointers with this newly-appointed Moon Eater. Teach him exactly what the word ‘talent’ means!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chanyi stepped forward after receiving Chi Wuyao’s command and stood opposite Ji Daopian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere in the main hall thickened and astonished looks appeared in everyone’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the sole exception of Ji Daopian, all of the seven Moon Eaters present were level nine Divine Masters. They could tell with a single glance that this new Witch’s cultivation was in the middle of the eighth level of the Divine Master Realm whereas Ji Daopian’s cultivation was at the latter stages of the eighth level of the Divine Master Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were both eighth level Divine Masters but when one reached the latter stages of the Divine Master Realm, even the difference of half a level was nearly insurmountable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Moon Eaters and Witches were luminaries of the same standing, the devil arts that they cultivated were more or less equal. That was exactly why even a small difference could be described as “nearly insurmountable”. The strength of their darkness profound energy could directly decide between the victor and the vanquished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, if they were to truly fight a duel, Witch Chanyi had practically no chance of winning… So what pointers could she even give Ji Daopian?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Devil Queen… Was she stark raving mad or was she deliberately trying to pick a fight?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Ji Daopian even had a chance to reply, Nanhuang Chanyi had already drawn her golden sword. Black mist spread out all over her body and her devilish might was flaring out at full force. “Please advise me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that she had already drawn her sword, Burning Moon had no choice but to respond in kind. In fact, they would not be able to find a reason to refuse even if they wanted to. Ji Daopian’s eyes narrowed as he turned to look toward the Burning Moon God Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Burning Moon God Emperor rose to his feet and said, “Fine, since the Devil Queen is so eager, Daopian, go and spar with the supremely talented Ninth Witch.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, royal father!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Daopian flung his arm open with a soft, disdainful snort and a huge black halberd appeared out of thin air. It caused a roiling wave of darkness energy to surge out and shake the entire hall. And in the short span of a single breath, it violently tore apart most of Chanyi’s energy field.</span></p>

The excess power generated by the gigantic halberd had been absorbed or resisted by her Witch Domain and she swiftly regained her balance.</span></p>

However, even though he was shocked by the scene that had played out in front of his eyes, he did not allow himself to get flustered. He did not stop his headlong charge and he swept his giant halberd forward, smashing apart the dark lotus in front of him… But just then, the pupils in his eyes fiercely shrank.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of all of the Moon Eaters who had gathered in the main hall today changed dramatically. Even the Burning Moon God Emperor… had subconsciously taken half a step forward when he saw what the Witch Chanyi did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had an even better view of the fight than Ji Daopian did, so they clearly saw Witch Chanyi create three dark lotuses consecutively even though she was off-balance and her power had been blasted aside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The giant black halberd thrust out viciously and devilish light instantly filled the area.

Furthermore, it was also at this moment that Witch Chanyi rushed in front of Ji Daopian. Black and gold clashed as a dark light shone from the golden symbols inscribed on her sword as she suddenly thrust it in his direction</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

This time, it was Ji Daopian, who had not put the full force of his strength into the blow, who felt his body quiver violently. After that, he felt his body flying backwards as a look of shock flashed across his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he had not even been given the chance to catch his breath as another sword beam shot toward him. She had clearly rushed forward to catch up to him, but the might of her blow was actually no weaker than the previous one!</span></p>

A slash of her sword shoved aside Ji Daopian’s giant halberd and a malevolent look flashed across her face as a black lotus heavily smashed into his body, causing the domain around his body to sink in heavily at the point of impact.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang——</span></p>

Instead, her attacks were growing fiercer and fiercer. Her sword strikes were so fast that they resembled a raging storm as they poured down on Ji Daopian. And this was not even the astonishing thing about her attacks...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most astonishing and irregular thing about her attacks was that each blow of her sword contained a tyrannical amount of dark power. It had not receded or grown any weaker despite her constant rain of blows. In fact, her Witch Domain, which had nearly been blasted apart earlier, was now slowly unfurling once more. It grew bigger and bigger as it started to suppress Ji Daopian’s ever-shrinking domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the six Moon Eaters in the audience rose to their feet, mystified and astonished expressions on each and every one of their faces. Even the Burning Moon God Emperor could no longer hide the shock on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Darkness profound energy was an extremely strong but unruly beast.

The speed at which she gathered, released, and withdrew her darkness profound energy was so fast that even he, a god emperor of the northern region, could not understand what was happening… In fact, it was fair to say that he was completely confused by this.</span></p>

She unleashed an unending torrent of attacks, her sword flashed with such alacrity that it resembled a fount of quicksilver flowing out from the ground. Before Ji Daopian could even catch his breath after each clash of arms, Witch Chanyi fiercely assaulted him with yet another wave of dark power.</span></p>

Ji Daopian’s numb right arm was violently smashed aside by Chanyi’s sword. He finally lost all feeling in that arm when his giant black halberd was sent flying from his hand. With her other hand, she forcefully pierced Ji Daopian’s protective domain, which was already on the verge of collapse. A black lotus then mercilessly exploded soon after, striking his chest.</span></p>

He flew through the air in a heap until his back smashed heavily against the barrier. When he fell to the ground, his body gently swayed as he stabilized himself… and forcefully swallowed the mouthful of blood that was surging up his throat.</span></p>
