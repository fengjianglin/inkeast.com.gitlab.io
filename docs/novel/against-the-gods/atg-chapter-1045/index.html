He looked fixedly at the Feathered Ice Spirit Flower for a long while and then actually began to slowly walk forward. He approached the extremely dangerous giant ice armored ape step by step but his eyes were still looking in the direction of the Feathered Ice Spirit Flower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Xuanyin clearly understood his intention when she saw him act in such a manner. She felt angry in her heart, "You scoundrel! You're risking your life for a moment of greed? This brat never learns his lesson!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Especially, why is he behaving like this for a mere Feathered Ice Spirit Flower!? In the Heavenly Netherfrost Lake, you can easily find a variant flower, which would be far better than that one!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che gradually drew closer, making his way ahead at an extreme slow pace. The aura emanating from the giant ape grew increasingly fearsome as he got closer and closer to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he was taking a great risk by doing so, Yun Che was still quite confident in achieving his goal. Using Moon Splitting Cascade to conceal his figure, along with Hidden Flowing Lightning which concealed his aura, he was confident that unless the giant ape released his spirit sense and proactively looked around vigilantly, it'd be very difficult for it to discover his existence, even if he was only around thirty meters away from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, it was currently in slumber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst the ice-cold silence, Yun Che continued to walk forward while maintaining his extremely slow pace and quietly arrived before the Feathered Ice Spirit Flower. He didn't experience any surprises or danger on his way to the flower. Yun Che was only ten meters away from the giant ice armored ape at present. He could faintly sense it letting out a heavy breath in its sleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, there was no unusual change in the giant ice armored ape's aura. It was evident that it hadn't sensed his presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che was even more surprised when he looked at the Feathered Ice Spirit Flower from up close. It was only the size of an adult's palm and its seven petals looked like tail feathers. Each petal was disseminating a distinct aura, as if all of them were independent lifeforms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flower was emitting a cold, white light, giving it a particularly magnificent and beautiful appearance. However, when Yun Che slowly brought his palm closer to it, he didn't feel the chilliness characteristic to the ice-attribute flowers. Instead, he felt a warm and comfortable feeling, that made people feel at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright..." Yun Che lightly touched the Feathered Ice Spirit Flower with utmost carefulness. The Sky Poison Pearl glowed with a faint light, after which the flower was plucked off the stem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Watching the whole process from high above in the sky, Mu Xuanyin frowned slightly, "Let me teach you a lesson!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One should risk their life when it was required to accomplish their objective but it was certainly a great taboo to do so just to satisfy your greed for an unnecessary thing. What made her especially angry was that even though he knew that the Heavenly Netherfrost Lake had countless spirit flowers and all kinds of herbs, he still took the risk of getting closer to a profound beast in the Divine Tribulation Realm in order to obtain a mere Feathered Ice Spirit Flower. His action was totally ridiculous!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She lightly pointed her finger. A blue light burst out at once, with a tip as sharp-looking as a needle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che deeply glanced at the Feathered Ice Spirit Flower while holding it between his palms. Just when he was going to place it inside the Sky Poison Pearl, an abrupt change happened in his surroundings. A sense of fatal danger immediately pricked at the nerves throughout his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"ROAR!!!!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The calm airflow in the place grew intensely agitated like a tsunami. The giant ice armored ape got up and let out a sky-shaking bellow. Yun Che, who was only ten meters away, nearly vomited blood due the shockwaves generated by it. As the giant ape crazily unleashed its power, the ice and snow in the surroundings burst apart because of the impact. Yun Che's figure was also exposed in no time and the eyes of the giant ice armored ape, that were releasing the light of madness and wrath, clearly caught sight of the Feathered Ice Spirit Flower in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"...?!!" Yun Che paled in fright. He quickly stored the flower in the Sky Poison Pearl before dashing away like a thunderbolt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter what creature, all of them would need some time to fully sober up after awakening from their sleep. Therefore, even though the giant ice armored ape woke up the moment he plucked off the Feathered Ice Spirit Flower, he was confident in safely leaving the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, the giant ice armored ape seemed so violent, as if it had been firmly stabbed with a knife. It was in deep slumber just a moment ago, releasing an incomparably calm aura. And now, it appeared to have gone completely berserk, right after awakening from its sleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Damn it... Yun Che gnashed his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How did things turn out this way? Could it also be a characteristic of the violent profound beasts living in Mist End Valley?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was naturally no coincidence that the giant ice armored ape was sleeping in the vicinity of the Feathered Ice Spirit Flower. It chose the location because the aura of the flower had an extremely strong attraction power to it. Even if it wasn't awakened in such a startling way, it'd have soon woken up on its own due to the absence of the aura from the Feathered Ice Spirit Flower—though Yun Che would have safely left by that time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, not only was it awakened in such a crude and startling manner, it also saw the Feathered Ice Spirit Flower falling into Yun Che's hands. As such, its initial berserk aura immediately became even more turbulent, like a volcano erupting two times in a row. The giant ape leapt high into the air as it pounced towards Yun Che and firmly smashed down his huge fist in burning rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As though the air had been shaken by a sudden clap of thunder, the entire area several kilometers ahead was enshrouded by the terrifying might of the fist attack launched by the giant ice armored ape. All the ice stones, huge trees, and glaciers broke and were destroyed in an instant, causing the layer of snow to cave in at an astonishing speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing a fatal, oppressive feeling from behind, Yun Che, who had no means to evade the attack, immediately activated "Rumbling Heaven," and unleashed Sealing Cloud Locking Sun with all his might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM——</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As though he had been struck by a heavy hammer, Yun Che suffered a hard fall, which again produced a very loud sound in the surroundings. A huge pit, with a depth of tens of meters, appeared around the place he had fallen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Sss..." Yun Che quickly got to his feet inside the huge pit. His whole body was feeling intense pain as well as numbness. The moment he got up, blood flowed out of the corner of his mouth, his nostrils and ears—if not for the fact that he had immediately activated Rumbling Heaven and opened the Heretic God barrier, he would be as good as dead, even if he survived the attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was the might of a being in the Divine Tribulation Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he somehow resisted the attack, it didn't mean that he was out of danger. On the contrary, he didn't even have the time to pant. Before he could calm down his agitated profound energy, he found himself enveloped in a scarlet, eye-piercing light that was being released by the other party's eyes. The thick and heavy arm of the giant ice armored ape again moved down to attack from above his head, bringing along the might of death and instantly shrouded his field of vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che instantaneously moved at an extremely fast speed, before opening the Heretic God barrier once more with all he had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground split apart and sank down and even all the small mountains several kilometers away crumbled and collapsed. As if he had been struck by a heavy hammer again, Yun Che was sent flying high into the sky. Despite the fact that he was only hit by the remnant shockwaves of the attack, the Heretic God barrier shattered into pieces after persevering for a brief while. However, he did succeed in barely escaping the great danger due to its help.</span></p>

He spit out a mouthful of blood and gnashed his teeth so hard that they almost broke apart…</span></p>

It had locked onto Yun Che's aura, effectively rendering him unable to evade its attack. The giant ape whirled its arm, preparing to shroud the surroundings with the might of the Divine Tribulation Realm.</span></p>

Instead, he took the initiative to charge toward the giant ice armored ape. Just when it was about to strike down with its huge arm, a blue figure flashed over his body and let out a world-shaking dragon roar.</span></p>

The berserk look in its eyes quickly turned into that of fear and his movements also came to a halt. Not intending to hold back anything, Yun Che unleashed all his profound energy at this moment, as he directly aimed for the head of the giant ice armored ape.</span></p>

At this moment, the remaining half had been sprinkled on the Cloud Butterfly Blade.</span></p>

But the giant ice armored ape not only had an incomparably thick ice-armor, its body was also being protected by the power of its Divine Tribulation Realm cultivation. Even if he had the Cloud Butterfly Blade and was also using the Rumbling Heaven to its ultimate extent, he didn't have absolute confidence in breaking open the ice-armor of his foe and stabbing right into its body.</span></p>

Moving like a shooting star, he shot a formless blade of light that was a foot long in length and pierced right through his opponent's head...</span></p>

But unexpected, the sound issuing from it getting torn was similar to a tough and tensile rock being cut apart.</span></p>

A muffled sound escaped from Yun Che's mouth as he got sent flying into the distance from the shock. The next instant, his vision turned dark all of as sudden. Amidst the pain and rage it was feeling due to the destroyed right eye, the giant ice armored ape swung around his huge arm in a disordered manner, which just happened to hit his body.</span></p>

His completely dulled consciousness had finally started to recover, ruthlessly exposing him to more and more intense pain that he could feel from every part of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the previous two attacks he received, he was using the Heretic God barrier with all his might in the Rumbling Heaven state, which was his ultimate defensive state. Besides, he only had to withstand the remnant shockwaves. However, he still suffered internal injuries despite it all.</span></p>

Yun Che slowly opened his eyes and faintly moved the fingers of his right hand. Then, he lifted his arm with difficulty and brought it behind him in order to grab a broken ice stones. He seemed to have the intention to get up to his feet. But upon lifting his arm to some extent, he noticed that his whole arm was dyed with fresh blood...</span></p>

There was nothing except severe pain left in his body and it was difficult to move even a bit. Not only his left arm, he also felt that his left rib cage and breastbone were mostly broken. His internal organs had dislocated by a great margin and there were countless cracks all over them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Aooo...wooo!!"</span></p>

In the midst of his blurred line of sight, he saw a huge figure crazily writhing around and struggling, while covering its right eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starting from the pierced right eye, a bizarre layer of crimson hue began to quickly spread across its thick ice-armor. In the blink of an eye, the entire body of the giant ape got covered in the layer, after which the crimson color deepened at an extremely fast rate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, the ice-white body of the giant ape turned crimson. Its roars and struggling movements became increasingly powerless before it fell heavily on the ground, wiggling and twitching in despair.</span></p>

Lying paralyzed on the ground, Yun Che laughed despite being extremely injured. He had actually killed a Divine Tribulation Realm existence once again, after having done the same to Mu Hanyi three months ago. Although he relied on the Dragon God Domain and horned dragon poison both times, it was definitely a miracle only he was capable of creating.</span></p>

If it was any other profound practitioner, including the ones at the Divine Soul Realm, they would have instantly been smashed to a pulp. Let alone being on their last breath, even their bones wouldn't be left intact.</span></p>

He hadn't been injured to such an extent even when he had a fierce battle with Xuanyuan Wentian in the past.</span></p>

He was still in Mist End Valley, after all. A brutal profound beast could appear before him at any instant. Forget about hiding himself, he was unable to stand up at present. Even a Winterfrost Direwolf, the weakest profound beast in the valley, could easily put him to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was at this time that a profound light started to glimmer around his chest all of a sudden. The profound light swiftly activated a small-sized profound formation, which released enough rays of light to cover his entire body within them. Soon after, he instantly disappeared from the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, exactly seventy-two hours had passed since he entered Mist End Valley. Hence, the spatial profound formation, which Mu Xuanyin had left on him, was triggered because the condition had been met. And thus, the severe punishment given to him by Mu Xuanyin had finally come to an end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"He truly is a lucky fellow," Mu Xuanyin mumbled, as she stood high in the sky, far-off from Yun Che's location. Afterwards, she turned around and vanished without making a sound.</span></p>
