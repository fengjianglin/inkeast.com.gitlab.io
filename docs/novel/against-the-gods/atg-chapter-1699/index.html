 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These invitation cards were personally delivered by people from one of three king realms and they were sent to all the realm kings and core sects of the upper and middle star realms. There were even a few invitation cards sent to the most important lower star realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, an invitation card from a king realm had never merely been just an invitation. It was, in reality, an imperial decree that could not be defied!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they refused an invitation from another star realm, it would, at worst, mean that they were not showing them any face. But none of them would dare to reject an “invitation” sent to them by one of the king realms, unless they were tired of living of course.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was quite common for a king realm of the Northern Divine Region to send out so many invitations. They would do so every time a new emperor was being crowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this invitation card had been sent out in the name of all three king realms!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The words “We invite all kings to come and greet our new ruler” contained a transcendent might that shook them to the core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The meaning contained behind those words was even more shocking than the might that emanated from them. They caused huge waves to crash about in the hearts of all the realm kings of the Northern Divine Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three king realms were jointly declaring that they had a “new ruler”?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three king realms were jointly appointing a new ruler?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A new ruler who stood above the three king realms!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was something unprecedented in the Northern Divine Region, a notion that had never crossed any of their minds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che. This name had swiftly spread through the upper echelons of the Northern Divine Region ever since he had appeared in the Heavenly Sovereign Assembly hosted by the Imperial Heaven Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Burning Moon Realm had fallen within the span of a single day. The news that Yun Che had inherited the legacy of a Devil Emperor and could release the power of a True God shot through the Northern Divine Region like a bolt of heavenly lightning… and Chi Wuyao was naturally also the one who was orchestrating everything behind the scenes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao had already started campaigning for Yun Che from the very beginning, causing his “name”, which was quite new to the Northern Divine Region, to crash into the minds of all the powerhouses of the Northern Divine Region. But this “invitation” and “grand ceremony” were still far too sudden, far too shocking. So much so that all of these wise and experienced overlords were left dumbfounded by the news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst their shock, all of these rulers began to sense that something incredible was afoot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The event was to be held a month from now. The location? The Soul Stealing Realm Sacred Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ————</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Burning Moon Realm had initially submitted for three reasons. The divine might Yun Che had displayed when he had obliterated Fen Daojun in a single instant, the devilish and seductive words of Chi Wuyao, and the transformation of the Witches.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But there was no doubt that this intimidation and Chi Wuyao’s persuasion would slowly erode with the passage of time, so she would have to continue to suppress any dangerous ideas the Burning Moon Realm might have.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, once the Burning Moon Realm saw that the Yama Realm had capitulated as well, they lost all desire to rebel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, once Yun Che had bestowed his dark blessing upon them, the remaining Moon Eaters felt their bodies go through a miraculous transformation, one that they had never dared to dream of. All of them were filled with wild joy and were overflowing with gratitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no such thing as unearned loyalty in this world. It was just like the concepts behind “the carrot and the stick”... He had shown enough of his&nbsp;stick and he had given them many bites of the carrot. In fact, even their legacies and lifelines were held in his hands—whether it was the Burning Moon or the Yama Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s grand coronation ceremony was already being prepared with much fanfare within the Soul Stealing Sacred Region. The Yama Realm and the Burning Moon Realm were also involved. When Yun Che had selected the Soul Stealing Sacred Region as the venue, it had sent a loud and clear signal to the other two realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these turbulent times for the Northern Divine Region, ironically, the man responsible for it all was currently unoccupied and relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er’s strength had not been the only thing that had been greatly boosted by the second Untamed World Pellet. Her fusion with the Devil Emperor blood had also progressed greatly. To Yun Che, she had now become an even more excellent dual cultivation incubator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he had pulled Qianye Ying’er into the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness, he borrowed the primordial devil energy to tirelessly dual cultivate with her day and night. In the short span of half a month, Qianye Ying’er’s profound strength, which had undergone a complete transformation, was much more solid and stable. Yun Che’s mastery of the Eternal Calamity of Darkness had also taken a great leap forward during this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he still remained in the middle stages of mastering it, his ability to control and use it had gone up several markers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, he would still need to concentrate a little when he was helping the dark profound practitioners undergo their dark rebirth. If an external force or internal resistance interfered with the process, it would cause him to fail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he could basically perform this dark blessing with a single thought now. However, the most important thing… was that it was much easier for him to transform large amounts of people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness was undoubtedly the best place for both Yun Che and Qianye Ying’er to cultivate. The level of the primordial yin energy in that place was extremely high and the energy itself was extremely dense. No other place in this universe could compare to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the Soul Stealing Realm’s sacred region, on the Soul Sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che sat on the ground cross-legged. His eyes were closed and no auras radiated from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had been spending the last few weeks dual cultivating with Qianye Ying’er inside the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness, so his cultivation and his mastery of the Eternal Calamity of Darkness had grown by leaps and bounds. Even so, no matter how hard he tried, he was not able to access the next level of the Law of Nothingness.</span></p>

Hah!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che slowly lifted his head towards the sky. Black clouds roiled in the heavens above as he spoke, “The Northern Divine Region. In this barren and vicious land of darkness, I thought that only boundless trials and malice awaited me. However… even though the road to becoming the messiah was fraught with peril and death, the journey to devildom, this descent into darkness, seems to have been guided by the very hand of destiny.”</span></p>

I was never supposed to be some sort of saint who would save the world! I was always destined to be a devil lord who would bring calamity!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But right now, what I really want to know is…” He started chuckling and his lips curved into a cold and wicked smile. The devilish light in his eyes grew even more sinister as he said, “Who in the three divine regions is going to be the ‘hero’ who finally slays me and saves the world in the end?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh.” Qianye Ying’er snorted at those words contemptuously. “A devil lord who brings calamity? Even if you saved the world ten times over, there would still be countless men in the God Realm who would drool at the thought of cutting you to pieces. Just because you slept with both the Dragon Queen and Goddess!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che shot a glance toward her. The cold wind had pressed her clothes against her body, revealing her enchantingly beautiful curves. He chuckled mockingly. “You were the ones who presented yourselves to me, yet I am the great sinner here? What a joke!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then you deserve to be ripped apart all the mo…” Qianye Ying’er’s voice halted and her golden eyes swivelled towards him. “So Shen Xi also presented herself to you?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che was stunned by that riposte.</span></p>

Chi Wuyao descended from the sky and no black mist covered her body this time, fully revealing her beautiful face and devilish figure. The small smile that played across her lips was so enthralling that it could bewitch a man a thousand times over and her exquisite body seemed to have been carved by the universe’s most skilled and lascivious sculptor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her arrival caused Yun Che to scramble to his feet as if by instinct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Qianye Ying’er’s brow crinkled.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao had only taken a single graceful step forward, but her ample bosom already started to jiggle in an alluring and provocative fashion… Qianye Ying’er’s brows twitched violently as she swiveled her head toward Chi Wuyao. She said with a cold snort, “I’m not lending him to you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bewitching and delicate fragrance assaulted their nostrils as Chi Wuyao appeared at Yun Che’s side. She gave him a flirtatious smile as she said, “You clearly said that you wanted to make this queen Yun Che’s empress, but you’re stuck to him twenty-four seven. You’re not even willing to give this queen a little bit of him. The nine children beside me, and even this queen herself, keep grumbling about the situation as we anxiously wait for a resolution on your end.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Her warm and gentle breath caressed Yun Che’s neck. Yun Che did not flinch but he felt his body heating up quickly as his blood started to boil uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Yun Che, Chi Wuyao’s most frightening aspect was not her Devil Emperor soul. Rather… it was the demonic seductiveness she exuded with every breath she took, something that the heavens had blessed her with from the very beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, she had used Mu Xuanyin’s icy and beautiful face, and her goddess-like body, a cold beauty which resembled a proud and lofty ice lotus, to push him over the edge. The effect was only amplified now that she approached him as the bewitching Devil Queen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao’s words made Qianye Ying’er swivel in her direction. As she stared at those devilish curves which even caused a woman’s heart to flutter, a bland smile crossed her face as she said, “Chi Wuyao, I keep endorsing you to be made Yun Che’s empress and this is also one of the conditions of our alliance and sincerity toward each other. However, the only person who can sleep with him is me. Those are two seperate things. Do you get what I’m saying?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che: “...???”</span></p>

A multitude of enchanting ripples danced in her eyes and even Qianye Ying’er was forced to swiftly avert her gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How can I help you?” Yun Che asked as he quietly exhaled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was doing his best to control his actions, he still tried to avoid her gaze in a rather unnatural manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He still hadn’t truly figured out how he should interact with Chi Wuyao.</span></p>

Your grand coronation ceremony will be held in seven days and all of the heroes of the Northern Divine Region will have gathered to witness it, but you still haven’t decided on your title as god emperor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As the very first ‘Devil Master’ of the Northern Divine Region, your imperial title happens to be very important indeed.”</span></p>
