 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A god emperor was an existence that stood at the pinnacle of this universe. All those who ascended the throne either did it for power or to pursue the peak of the profound way. They had risen above all other living creatures and lorded over all creation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Yun Che only wanted revenge. To him, his imperial title was of absolutely no importance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you brought this up, you must already have something in mind,” Yun Che pointedly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I actually have two titles in mind,” Chi Wuyao replied languidly. “The first one has to do with the fact that you’ve inherited the devil blood and devil art of the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor. You are her sole successor. So it is entirely reasonable for you to inherit the name ‘Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor’ as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This imperial title would carry unsurpassed authority in the Northern Divine Region.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s brow furrowed slightly as he asked, “What about the second?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heretic Emperor.” Chi Wuyao continued in a captivating voice, “Your fate turned the moment you inherited the Heretic God’s legacy. For you, who has the Heretic God’s powers running through your veins, it would not be inappropriate to take his title either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In addition, the word ‘Heretic’ is neither good nor evil. It includes lack of restraint and disdain which very much agrees with the turn your fate and frame of mind have taken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao finished speaking. However, she did not ask Yun Che for his opinion. Her beautiful eyes turned to look at Qianye Ying’er. “So, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er replied with a cold, stern expression, “He is neither the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor, nor is he the Heretic God. He is… unique and unmatched. He is Yun Che, someone who has no need for any other person’s prestige or titles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Chi Wuyao gave a small smirk as her gaze lowered slightly. “It looks like you… already have a title in mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Devil Master of the North—Emperor Yun!” Qianye Ying’er announced with a fierce glare. “Clouds have covered the blue dome of heaven since time immemorial and they’ve overlooked all of creation since the very beginning. His clouds will descend and engulf the entire world, they will overturn the earth and seas and his wrath will be like the thunder of the nine heavens themselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, that is his surname. Since he is crowned emperor, the word ‘Yun’ shall be ingrained in the hearts of all of creation!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er had just finished her sentence but her lips moved lightly. Her brow furrowed slightly as she directed her words toward Chi Wuyao using sound transmission, “This is also the eternal glory that he can bestow upon his family and clan members!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason she had said those words was because she wanted the word “Yun” to rise above everything else, so that he would be able to wipe away some of the deep guilt that he felt toward his family. This way, he would be able to bestow eternal glory upon his family and his clan… He would immortalize them in this manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to Qianye Ying’er’s hostility toward her, something which had clearly increased drastically from before, Chi Wuyao did not show the slightest intention to “engage” her. She gave Qianye Ying’er a small smile instead as she inclined her head and praised her words. “Very good. Devil Master Emperor Yun. It is decided then.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er, “...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che raised his head, “I haven’t even given my answer yet...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The second matter is regarding that lass from the Eastern Divine Region’s Glazed Light Realm,” Chi Wuyao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che was startled for a moment. He violently turned around, “Shui Meiyin? What’s happened to her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao had never interacted with Shui Meiyin in her true form before, but as “Mu Xuanyin”, she had met her more than once. Back then, she had single-handedly facilitated Yun Che and Shui Meiyin’s marriage… Although her efforts had all gone to waste in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Approximately two years ago,” Chi Wuyao replied languidly, “news that the Glazed Light Realm provided refuge to you was made known and they were punished by the Moon God Emperor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three words, “Moon God Emperor” simultaneously pricked the nerves of Yun Che and Qianye Ying’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s core shook violently as he growled in a low voice, “What... do you mean by punished?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao’s devilish voice was gentle and unhurried as she replied, “It was rumored that Glazed Light Realm King Shui Qianheng assumed responsibility for the whole matter. The Moon God Emperor wanted to execute him on the spot, but luckily for him, the Eternal Heaven God Emperor managed to intervene in the nick of time… He pleaded their case and asked the Moon God Emperor for mercy, so Shui Qianheng was crippled instead. But at the same time, Shui Meiyin was also sentenced to be imprisoned in the Moon God Realm for a thousand years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che neither spoke nor moved, but a dark malice appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Yun Che’s heart, there was only one other pure land in the Eastern Divine Region besides the Snow Song Realm. There was only one other girl who still chose to hug him as her tears stained his back, even after his darkness had been exposed to the world and it had become his enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On that day, a day so cold that it seemed like he had been plunged into a hell of ice, it was… his only source of warmth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After Shui Qianheng was crippled, he stepped down from his position as realm king and Shui Yingyue has been the Glazed Light Realm King ever since. As for Shui Meiyin, there has not been any news of her ever since she was imprisoned in the Moon God Realm. The Glazed Light Realm tried to visit her many times, but they were always chased away when they did.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che gripped his fists so tightly that his bones nearly shifted out of position as he ground his teeth in anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, he had left the Glazed Light Realm the instant he awoke. Moreover, he had tried his best to cut off all relations with them and erase any evidence involving them. But in the end, they had still been implicated to such a great extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No matter how the world sees you, you’ll always be the best… best person to ever exist in my heart.
