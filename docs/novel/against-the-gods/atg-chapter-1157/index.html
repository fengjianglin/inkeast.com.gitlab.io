Those great individuals that were mythical existences were present before his eyes and looking closely at him. He felt an unprecedented level of excitement, and was in no mood to pay attention to others. It was only just now that he discovered the familiar aura of Yun Che from some distance to his right. The two of them were separated by less than ten people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first reaction of Huo Poyun was, undoubtedly, disbelief at what he was seeing.</span></p>

It wasn't only Huo Poyun who noticed Yun Che. There was also another person, who harbored deep hatred for him—Jun Xilei. Catching sight of Yun Che, she stared him blankly for three breaths, "Impossible... How could he worm his way in here?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What's happening here? How can there be someone among us who is only at the Divine Tribulation Realm...? Wait a moment. This person is..." The eyes of Shui Yingyue stopped moving for a second, as she suddenly recalled the time when she had seen him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hehehe." If there was anyone who was not surprised at all, besides Wu Guike, it was only Shui Meiyin. Unlike the others, she had been sneakily looking at Yun Che from the very beginning. Now that he had become the focus of the entire Conferred God Stage, light circled around within her eyes too. Her tender face had a big smile on it. "So the Profound God Convention can actually be such a fun event."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This was bound to happen." Wu Guike started to feel uneasy.</span></p>

No matter what, it's impossible to enter the ranks of the ‘heaven chosen children' with such a cultivation, right?"</span></p>

I didn't think that someone would dare cheat in the Profound God Convention! Furthermore, he forced his way into the top thousand. Is he looking for death or what!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How exactly did he pull it off?"</span></p>

Once they discovered this different kind of existence among the top thousand, first surprise and then disbelief surfaced in their eyes. Afterwards, the looks in their eyes turned into that of disdain and pity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an extremely tremendous achievement to be one of the top thousand at the Profound God Convention. For a person in the first level of Divine Tribulation Realm to make it into the top thousand was so ridiculous that even a three year old child wouldn't believe it. Cheating itself wasn't that bad, as no matter what means was employed, it was in itself a kind of ability to be able to cheat. They could have overlooked such a thing if the cheating was done to rise in the ranks and not to dare to improperly become one of the top thousand in the overall ranking, which lead him to be clearly exposed to the eyes of the four great god emperors of the Eastern Divine Region, and countless realm kings of other star realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would be an understatement to say he was looking for death. He was simply stupid beyond imagination.</span></p>

Even the Eternal Heaven God Emperor, who was the most gentle and calm among them, had a frown on his face. He was just about to say something when a wanton, crazy laugh reached his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hahahaha, hahahahahaha..." The upper-half of God Emperor Cang Shitian's body was bent backward, as he laughed aloud while clapping. "Interesting, so very interesting! A person with a meager profound strength of the first level of the Divine Tribulation Realm was actually able to make his way into the top thousand youngsters of the Eastern Divine Region, huh. It has really broadened this king’s horizons, hahahaha."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no doubt that God Emperor Cang Shitian was ridiculing the Eastern Divine Region with his loud laugh, which further darkened the expressions of the four great god emperors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even a profound practitioner of the first level of the Divine Tribulation Realm was able to enter the ranks of the top thousand, which effectively pulled down the threshold to make it into the top thousand of the Eastern Divine Region to the first level of the Divine Tribulation Realm. How could they not be ridiculed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were to spread, there was no doubt the entire convention would become a gargantuan joke.</span></p>

"Qu Hui!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following his two indifferently uttered words, the whole place became quiet.</span></p>

His stateliness, that seemed to be suppressing the heaven and earth, made all profound practitioners feel a chilling sensation all of a sudden, as they kept quiet out of fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes moved a bit as his gaze, which appeared sharper than a sword forged with the standards of the divine way, fell straight on Yun Che. An indescribable chill made all the young profound practitioners beside Yun Che frightened in their hearts, and they swifty and carefully distanced themselves from him. A wide space had opened in the midst of the thousand people, with Yun Che at its center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You there, come out."</span></p>

The tone of his voice was extremely indifferent. Although there was not the slightest profound strength emitting from him, a coercion swept down from some unknown place as it weighed down the bodies of others like extremely heavy iron plates. It caused all of these topnotch young experts to hold their breath, without exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, this should look very funny to others, allowing them to enjoy the misfortune of the other party, and even vent their hatred for him. However, because of Honorable Qu Hui’s frightening fame, they were incomparably nervous, and felt pity for Yun Che rather than despising or hating him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because in front of Honorable Qu Hui, no matter how great one’s origin was, even if they were the illegitimate child of the Heavenly King, they would be done for.</span></p>

Even Luo Changsheng was unable to have such a "special honor."</span></p>

Where are you from?" Honorable Qu Hui asked. There wasn’t the slightest emotion in his tone.</span></p>

In the God Realm, even the lower star realms, which were of the lowest level in the God Realm, disdained the profound practitioners from the lower realm, and viewed them as "inferior existences."</span></p>

So, if he was truly from the mere lower realm... there was no doubt that he would be punished without the slightest chance of being forgiven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Brother... Yun..." Huo Poyun swayed a bit, as his entire body felt uneasiness. However, he didn't dare to recklessly take any action or say something.</span></p>

Wh-Wh... What should we do?" all the hairs on Mu Huanzhi's body stood on end and he was in an extremely panicked state. Yun Che was the direct disciple of Mu Xuanyin. If something were to happen to him, they would have no explanations for Mu Xuanyin when they returned to their star realm. Moreover, how could this matter be an issue for Yun Che alone...? It was extremely likely that their Snow Song Realm would also be implicated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was, after all, the Profound God Convention, where all the four emperors, as well as the Dragon Monarch and God Emperor Shitian had arrived!</span></p>

So... how did his brain suddenly become full of shit!?" Huo Rulie was also alarmed and restless with anxiety, as he rained curses in fury.</span></p>

In the area allocated to the Star God Realm, the Heavenly Poison Star God Moonflower, who had been fiddling with her fingers this whole time, and not showing the slightest interest in anything that happened, narrowed her eyes, as a light moan came from her sensual and seductive lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What is it?"

I just suddenly thought of someone." The voice of Moonflower was lovely, soft, and sluggish, similar to a charming beauty speaking by a man's ear in a low tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don't know who had such bad luck and a short life to actually be remembered by a female devil like you," the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Strength</span> God Shenhu said.</span></p>

Moonflower gently caressed and stroked her long and thin fingers that had too strong a fragrance of flowers coming from them. She narrowed her eyes, "This little brother who is seeking death, not only looks like him, his name is the same as well. Isn't that quite interesting?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The face of Honorable Qu Hui seemed even stiffer than fine iron, as if no expression would ever appear on it. But, a wisp of strange light flashed through the depths of his pupils as he looked straight at Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not only the case with Honorable Qu Hui. Slight change had happened in the gazes of the Dragon Monarch, Brahma Heaven God Emperor, Eternal Heaven God Emperor, Star God Emperor, and Moon God Emperor. Especially, God Emperor Shitian, who had been laughing crazily for a long while, he revealed an expression of interest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because Yun Che was too calm.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Yun Che... didn't move in the least as he stood without any changes in his expression. Even his aura was like still water where no waves surfaced. He was behaving simply like a bystander that had nothing to do with the matter at hand... No, he was even calmer than a bystander.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze was continuously drifting around... It wasn't due to being so utterly afraid that his gaze was wandering aimlessly, instead, he was actually looking around him in a seemingly absent-minded state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che was certainly not afraid in the least. On the contrary, he was eager for such a thing to happen. However, he really wasn't as calm in his heart as he looked from the outside. At least, his heart had been beating crazily this whole time... though not because of the punishment he was about to receive.</span></p>

During the eight years he and Jasmine had been together, it was absolutely not just them spending time from morning to night with each other, but also "coexisting in the same body." He believed that if Jasmine was in his vicinity, he would surely be able to perceive her.</span></p>

No! It’s definitely because there are so many powerful auras mixed at this place that I’m not able to locate her in a short time. If she’s here, she must have seen me by now.</span></p>
