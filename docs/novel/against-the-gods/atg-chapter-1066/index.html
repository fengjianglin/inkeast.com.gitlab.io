Mu Bingyun had always been feeling uneasy in her mind and found it difficult to calm herself down. Usually, her mind would be devoid of worldly things and she harbored very few desires, so it was extremely rare for her to be feeling such emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this day, she spent nearly an hour but still failed to enter into meditation. Her heart suddenly felt a severe prickling for a second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She opened her cold eyes and informed Mu Xiaolan of her going out for a while. Then, she flew away from Ice Phoenix Palace and headed straight to the Ice Phoenix Divine Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great Elder, does the dimension formation for going to the Flame God Realm still contain energy?” Mu Bingyun found Mu Huanzhi and immediately inquired with knitted brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want to go to the Flame God Realm? What happened?” Mu Huanzhi promptly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Bingyun said with a frown, “Since the sect master left for the Flame God Realm, I have been feeling uneasy this whole time. Last night, I even awoke from an ominous dream. I’m worried whether something has happened to the sect master in the Flame God Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Huanzhi was startled, before he said with a smile, “Hoho, no need to be anxious. The Flame God Realm doesn’t possess anything that could threaten the safety of the sect master. As for that ancient horned dragon, Sect Master has fought it many times before. So, even if she fails to slaughter it, there’s absolutely no possibility of her getting hurt by it. Besides, the dragon fault of that horned dragon was already been injured by Sect Master a thousand years ago, which makes it even more impossible for it to be a threat to her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Bingyun lightly shook her head. “I have never felt this way and it’s even more odd to constantly feel so during these past few days. Vainly mulling over it would be useless… I must make a trip to the Flame God Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Huanzhi pondered for a short while and then nodded his head, “If that’s the case, you might as well go and confirm the situation yourself. However, the dimension formation for going to the Flame God Realm has not been activated for almost a thousand years and hence, the power within it should have been dissipated by now. I’ll immediately order some people to once again activate the dimension formation with profound crystals.” He paused for a moment before continuing, “Tomorrow, I’ll accompany you to the Flame God Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he firmly believed that nothing would happen to Mu Xuanyin, given the formidable strength she possessed, Mu Bingyun and her were sisters from the same father and mother. Therefore, it wasn’t right to completely ignore what Mu Bingyun was feeling, which might have arisen due to the interaction between their souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The world inside the Primordial Profound Ark.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ruler of the vast Snow Song Realm and the most revered Divine Master, who was standing at the zenith of the entire God Realm, was lying in Yun Che’s arms while trembling and breathing heavily, like a delicate girl that had been ravaged for a long period of time. She stayed that way until closing her charming eyes and sluggishly falling into slumber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the corners of her eyes, there were still a few tear stains that had yet to dry completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che lightly got off Mu Xuanyin’s body, after which his reason fully awakened and he sat blankly in place. He had no idea what to make of the current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The air was filled with the particularly strong smell of bodily releases and the dried-up grassy area around him looked thoroughly ruined, as if it had been wrecked by storm and heavy rain. Mu Xuanyin’s long hair was a mess and her jade-like body, that was even more shockingly beautiful and alluring than a fairy, was covered in glittering beads of sweat. Furthermore, faint red marks could be clearly seen on her snow-white skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blankly looking at her, sometimes Yun Che’s heart would beat crazily and at other times it would stop abruptly. His mind was in complete disorder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had already gone so far with her… It was to save Mu Xuanyin’s life but at this time, he couldn’t even dare to believe that he had truly done such a thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What level of existence was Mu Xuanyin…? She was a person at the Divine Master Realm, the closest one could reach to the realm of god. Once someone became a Divine Master, they would be standing at the peak of the Primal Chaos and become a god among among all people in the boundless universe. Just one word from her could decide the fate of any living being in the Snow Song Realm and a flick of her finger could exterminate an entire dynasty. Even the strongest person of the Flame God Realm would absolutely not dare to act rashly before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Given her strength, she had reached such heights that, let alone blaspheming her, there was almost no one that would show the least bit of disrespect to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, he was from a lower realm planet that the people of the God Realm disdained to even think about. It had only been a very short while since he entered the divine way and was no more than a minuscule existence in the vast God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His greatest achievement after arriving at the God Realm was to become her direct disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, he’d actually…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was absolutely the craziest… and the most frightening thing he had done in his two lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s really over for me this time,” Yun Che mumbled to himself. “Master is going to definitely kill me… If this matter were to spread around, all the inhabitants of the Snow Song Realm would want to swallow me alive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Yun Che was about to get up after spacing out for a good while, his lower abdomen severely throbbed all of a sudden. Soon after, an incomparable cold energy burst out and instantly spread throughout his body, from the inside to the outside. Afterwards, it rapidly gathered together once again, as it rushed into his profound meridians.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Yun Che could react to it, dense frosty mist began to rise from all over his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s… this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt as though countless hurricanes were swirling within his body, that frenziedly gushed into his profound veins after travelling through his normal meridians. The profound energy in his Heretic God’s Profound Veins began to move like a whirlpool due to the influence of the hurricanes, swirling at an extremely fast speed, as well as expanding at a rapid rate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, Yun Che was only surprised to see the considerable expansion of the whirlpool but soon he felt panicked in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is Master’s ice phoenix vital yin!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he came to that realization, he immediately crouched down on the ground, unable to think any further. He did his utmost to exercise restraint on his mind and gave his all to attempt guiding the frost aura that was running amok throughout his body… But, the aura was of such a high level that it was basically impossible for Yun Che to deal with it. Even though it was coursing through his body, he had no control over the aura and it continued to flow on its own towards his profound veins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, when a person was invaded by the aura of an energy that even they were unable to understand, the only outcome waiting for them would be death from bodily explosion. However, this cold energy actually blended with Yun Che’s body, as if it had perfect affinity with him.

Earlier, Yun Che relied on the power of the Heavenly Netherfrost Lake and spent three months to break through to the second level of the Divine Origin Realm. Such a cultivation speed could already be considered extremely amazing in the God Realm.</span></p>

His profound strength amplified at a completely absurd rate, leaving him unable to think straight for a long period of time.</span></p>

He thought back to what Mu Xuanyin had told him in a flirtatious and playful manner after he somehow resisted the desire to snatch away Mu Feixue’s ice phoenix vital yin. She had said that if he could get her ice phoenix vital yin, he would be able to raise his cultivation realm by leaps and bounds in an evening’s time.</span></p>

Later, he also spent several hours dealing with the poison in Mu Xuanyin’s body, which lead to his body feeling incomparably heavy to him.</span></p>

It was as if he was bathing in a breeze in the midst of a bamboo forest, feeling so contented that he almost wanted to float in the air.</span></p>

He didn’t release his spirit sense to specifically perceive the things around but as if it had been extended to some space crack, the way he perceived the world was poles apart from before.</span></p>

It still had the shape of a nebula but now countless obscure and silky lines could be seen all over it, like one would find on cotton batting.</span></p>

Once a person succeeded in reaching the Divine Soul Realm, their soul would transform from ordinary level to divine. Such a transformation would be extremely obvious to other profound practitioners, as their spirit sense, mental strength and perception power would increase dramatically. Furthermore, it was extremely difficult to execute a soul searching technique on a soul that had entered the divine way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the case when he was in the Divine Origin Realm, due to the fact that Yun Che’s soul had already transcended the ordinary level, he didn’t experience that big of a change. He only felt his mental strength becoming even stronger and didn’t feel anywhere close to the “transformation” upon ascending to a completely new realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After remaining in an astounded state for a long while, he discovered, to his surprise, that Mu Xuanyin’s vital yin was still on the move inside his body, spurring on the rapid increase of his profound energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The breakthrough… hasn’t ended yet!?</span></p>

However, it was natural that it would be even more difficult to break through than when he was in the Divine Origin Realm. The profound energy grew several times slower than earlier but still didn’t show any signs of stagnation. It constantly increased bit by bit… and finally reached the limit of the realm.</span></p>

On the other hand, Mu Xuanyin…</span></p>

Immediately, he turned in Mu Xuanyin’s direction to discover her beautiful eyes slightly open, with an unclear and glazed expression in them. She looked the epitome of beauty and there was an unusual reddish glow on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che promptly went over and placed his hand on her chest… He instantly felt a soft and scorching sensation in his hand.
