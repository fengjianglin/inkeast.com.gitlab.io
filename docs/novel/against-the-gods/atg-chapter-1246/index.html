It was enough to suppress Divine Kings and Divine Sovereigns to the point where their bodies and souls would collapse. Forget about struggling or resisting, even lifting a finger would be extremely difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet Yun Che had actually made an instantaneous reaction, and that counterattack… seemed to have been made without any suppression at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this was Luo Guxie’s power he was dealing with, so his counter seemed to be as pathetic and powerless as a leaf caught in a tornado.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lightning dragon’s cry resounded through space as it met the tornado head on. The moment the two powers came into contact with each other, the space in that area exploded and fractured in an exaggerated fashion. Following that, an extremely shocking event was reflected in everybody’s eyes… The lightning dragon had torn apart the tornado as it ripped through it in a single pass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wha… What!?” This scene caused the jaws of countless profound practitioners to fiercely hit the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a windstorm generated by the power of a Divine Master. Furthermore, this was no ordinary Divine Master, it was a late stage Divine Master who stood at the very peak of the profound way. Moreover, in order to not hurt Luo Changsheng, the radius of this attack had been compressed to its very limit, but its penetration and killing power were definitely capable of piercing straight through a small star.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet this attack had actually been torn apart… by the lightning dragon Yun Che had flung out!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was even more dreadful than that was the fact that the tornado did not split into two seperate explosions and engulf the surrounding area. Instead, after it was ripped apart and passed through by that pale white lightning dragon, it had begun to dissipate and fall apart. Before the pale white lightning dragon could be&nbsp;torn apart, the tornado which came from Luo Guxie vanished without a trace, with not a single a shred of its power remaining.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eternal Heaven God Emperor and the Dragon Monarch who had been hurtling forward with all their might both came to a simultaneous halt as their faces colored with a hard to come by shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pale white lightning dragon which tore apart that storm force astonishingly did not look like it had weakened at all. It was still as swift as lightning as it hurtled towards Luo Guxie… The latter had attacked in rage and she originally believed that Yun Che was already deader than dead. She could never have imagined that things would unfold the way they did and was thus caught completely unprepared by this turn of events. She simply stared at the onrushing attack with a dumbstruck look on her face, as she was struck in the chest by the white lightning dragon…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sizzzz!</span></p>

A Divine Master’s protective profound energy was the pinnacle of defensive power in this world, but it instantly wilted away in the face of that attack. The pale white lightning dragon passed through her body and soared toward the heavens, disappearing from everyone’s view in the next instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOOOOM——————————</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distant sky above, an enormous lightning domain exploded, and under the white light, which filled the sky, an incomparably huge dimensional black hole appeared. The entire Eternal Heaven God Realm started to shake violently… It shook for many breaths before the white lightning and the dimensional black hole in the sky disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene was just like when that heavenly might had descended into this world… and that pale white lightning had also been composed of that most dreadful heavenly might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hole around half an inch wide appeared in Luo Guxie’s chest. Her face stiffened into a mask, and her eyes were dark and gloomy as she lowered her gaze to stare fixedly at the enormous hole in her chest. It was as if her soul had left her body…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone’s eyes were glued to that hole as well… The entire world was cloaked in a deathly, terrifying silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pffffff!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood suddenly spurted out wildly from that wound like a geyser, and in the blink of an eye, Luo Guxie’s upper body was dyed in blood. Luo Guxie’s eyes lost their color as she plummeted to the ground below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Gu… Guxie!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if Luo Shangchen had suddenly roused himself from a nightmare as he soared towards her plummeting figure… The distinguished Holy Eaves Realm King nearly stumbling in his haste to go over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How… how... how can this be…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fairy Guxie… actually… was actually…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Shangchen grabbed ahold of the falling Luo Guxie as he released all of the profound energy in his body and sent it surging into her body. At the same time, he also used his profound energy to cover up that incomparably dreadful wound in the most careful manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Guxie’s eyes held a slackness that Luo Shangchen had never seen before. It seemed like she had descended into the most absurd and dreadful nightmare as her aura flowed around her entire body in a frenzied manner...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chang… sheng…” She muttered in a lost and dispirited voice before her body shuddered and she fainted dead away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mas… Master!” Luo Changsheng let out a painful wail as he struggled to his knees on the barrier that made up the Profound God Stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dreadful silence lingered around the Conferred God Stage. The impact of all the events that had just unfolded, in front of their eyes, was nearly as great as the impact of that world-shocking nine stage lightning tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Guxie, who stood at the peak of the Eastern Divine Region, had suddenly made an attack against Yun Che—a junior who had just broken into the Divine Spirit Realm, who had not even reached the age of thirty. Yet the lightning dragon counterattack Yun Che launched had actually torn apart the tornado Luo Guxie threw at him and even dealt her a severe blow afterwards…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the most ridiculous and inexplicable things that they had seen in their entire lives added up together still would not equal that one instance in which all of these events unfolded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That was the power of the heavenly law… it was the heavenly might that assailed us just now!” Head of the Heavenly Mystery Three Elders, Mo Yu, said in a trembling voice. “He actually… gained mastery over the heavenly might which appeared previously!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The power that Yun Che had used to severely wound Luo Guxie was definitely not his own. It was actually a small remnant of the tribulation lightning sent down by the heavenly law that Yun Che had forcefully retained before it dissipated like it was supposed to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Master Mo Yu said was true and his words were not the least bit exaggerated. Even though it had only been for a very short span of time, Yun Che did indeed control the power of heavenly law. Furthermore, that power belonged to the highest levels produced by the heavenly law.</span></p>

The pale white lightning that covered his body had completely disappeared and the aura which had caused a formless dread to grip the hearts of the gathered god emperors vanished along with it.</span></p>

At this moment, everyone present was very clear on one fact, and that was the fact that Yun Che was a freak who could not be explained using common sense. But at this moment, the profound aura that he was displaying still caused everyone present to gasp in astonishment.</span></p>
