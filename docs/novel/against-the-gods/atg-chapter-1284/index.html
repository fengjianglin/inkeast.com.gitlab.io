Xia Qingyue had suddenly grabbed ahold of Yun Che’s hand, stunning everyone in the area, but before they even had time to react, the two people had already fled far away using the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace.</span></p>

In just a single instant, it had already crossed over to the horizon that was extremely far away, and even its shadow had vanished completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the Moon God Emperor and the Moon God Empress’ wedding ceremony, but the Moon God Empress had used the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace to run away with Yun Che…</span></p>

It felt as if they were suddenly completely shaken, turned inside out by the innumerable lightning bolts and angry tidal waves that were raging around in their hearts...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The impact this scene had on them was absolutely no less than the impact they had felt when witnessing the nine stage heavenly tribulation at the Conferred God Stage!</span></p>

The profound practitioners of the Eastern Divine Region, the moon god envoys, the gathered realm kings, the god emperors… including the Star God Emperor who had been eager to start all of this trouble, and even Qianye Ying’er, who had remained hidden in the clouds above. Each and every one of them had been completely and utterly shocked and stupefied by this turn of events.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Moon God Emperor simply stood there with a blank stare on his face. But gradually, the features on his face started to twist and his body started to quake. His originally tranquil and dignified face started going a dreadful ghastly pale and his features were swiftly contorting into a face that resembled a sinister demon’s visage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He extended an arm that shuddered so violently that it seemed like it was going to fall apart and pointed in the direction that Xia Qingyue had left, before he roared in what was perhaps the most hoarse voice he had ever let out in his life, “Go… and capture… them! Go and capture them!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he let out that hoarse scream, the Moon God Emperor’s vision went black and his entire body swayed. He had actually nearly fallen to the ground.</span></p>

Divine Moon City was immediately thrown into great chaos as a large number of people soared into the sky and rushed in the direction the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace had fled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, among those who had taken action, there was a golden figure that suddenly flashed across the sky like a comet, instantly leaving all the other figures in the dust… The speed that golden figure displayed was actually nearly no less than the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace that had already fled into the distance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine Moon City was in a complete uproar, everyone looked at each other only to discover that the other person was completely and utterly shocked as well. It was as if nobody dared to believe the events that had just taken place before their very eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could… this… sort of thing happen?” Mu Huanzhi asked in a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh no…” Mu Bingyun sighed quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh heh heh,” the Star God Emperor put away his shock and amazement while giving a bland laugh. “Marvelous, this is absolutely marvelous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Star God Emperor and the Moon God Emperor were very near one another. So his words had undoubtedly splashed hot oil into a raging fire. The Moon God Emperor’s eyes turned scarlet as if they had been stained with fresh blood. He pointed at the Star God Emperor, the profound energy in front of that finger rioting wildly, “You! Get out of here right now… OUT!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“GET OUT!! EVERYONE GET OUT!!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fury of a god emperor could shake the very heavens and earth. Under the power of his extremely hoarse and furious howl, all of the jade bottles and jade cups shattered as space itself began to faintly tremble. A majority of the young profound practitioners vomited fresh blood amid furious coughing, their internal organs suffering heavy wounds. There were also some profound practitioners who saw black, then and there, as they fainted dead away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who would still dare to linger near the berserk fury of a god emperor? The various big star realms did their utmost to protect their young profound practitioners as they fled towards the outskirts of Divine Moon City in a panic. In an instant, Divine Moon City, which was being graced by the light of a bright moon, was thrown into complete and utter chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go… quickly!” Mu Huanzhi swiftly rallied all the Snow Song Realm disciples and fled towards the outskirts with the greatest speed possible… If the Moon God Emperor decided to vent his anger on the Snow Song Realm, they would not make it in time if they tarried any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine Moon City suddenly looked as if a swarm of locusts had descended upon it. Disturbances sprung up all over the city as its denizens reeled about in panic and alarm. Not a single one of the moon guards assigned to the various districts rushed out to maintain order as even they were at a complete loss at what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This grand wedding celebration was originally an event of great joy for the Moon God Realm. It was supposed to have wiped away the shame the Moon God Emperor suffered all those years ago and more significantly, it was supposed to have grandly announced to the entire world that from this day forward, the Moon God Realm would be like the Eternal Heaven Realm of all those years ago, receiving the blessing of a woman of Glazed Glass.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But before the wedding ceremony could even begin, it had already become like this…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The god empress who was about to be wed left on her own, and she had even taken another man with her before running away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only did this not wash away the shame inflicted by what happened to Yue Wugou all those years ago, it instead piled humiliation upon humiliation…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the four god emperors of the Eastern Divine Region, the realm king of the Moon God Realm, had actually completely and utterly become the greatest laughingstock under all of heaven...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Moon God Emperor was lost in his berserk fury and he resembled a crazed wild beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But how could he not be enraged… Even if he was a god emperor, this matter was even more humiliating and enraging because he was a god emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s leave.” In the clouds high above, Qianye Ying’er turned around, her gaze, astonishingly enough, directed towards where the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace had fled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Zhu did not reply, but neither did he need to question or give a response. The figures of the two people slowly receded into the clouds before they vanished in the air above Divine Moon City. Perhaps, no one knew that they had even been there in the first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To think that such a thing actually happened…” The Eternal Heaven God Emperor shook his head. In this world, there were far too few things that could astonish him, but the events that had unfolded before his very eyes were too far outside of his calculations, so it caused him to feel an unfathomable shock as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Brahma Heaven God Emperor, however, held him back as he spoke while shaking his head, “The Moon God Emperor is truly enraged, and deservedly so. No consolation or advice will have any use at this moment. On the contrary, it might even cause him to go completely wild. We should spend our efforts protecting the gathered profound practitioners. Let’s wait for him to calm down after a few days before we try to discuss anything with him.”</span></p>
