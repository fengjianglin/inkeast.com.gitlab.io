 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But his death and the death of a Star Guard were completely different notions. His death was a huge event that could shake the entire Eastern Divine Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because Xing Mingzi was a genuine Divine Master!</span></p>

In a world with no more True Gods, they were considered supreme and exalted divinities, they were existences that had been crowned with the title “World Rulers”.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As strong as the Star God Realm was, besides the unique Star God legacies, there were only thirty-seven Divine Masters in this generation and it would take an average of an entire millennia for a new one to appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an upper star realm, it would take on average ten thousand years or even tens of thousands of years before a Divine Master would appear.</span></p>

Their ultimate conclusion was basically dying of old age. Even though Xing Mingzi was the least of the Star God Realm’s thirty-seven elders, he was a true and genuine Divine Master. His death was the same as the death of an higher realm king, it was an event that was enough to shake every piece of ground in every corner of the Eastern Divine Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he had not died at the hands of another king realm or another Divine Master. He had been buried by Yun Che, had died at the hands of a junior who had just become a Divine King, a junior who had not even reached thirty years of age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if he died within his own Star God Realm, surrounded by all the gathered Star Guards...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was this peerlessly ridiculous and absurd event that had bloodily played out before their very eyes.</span></p>

In order to guarantee the highest success rate, they could not be distracted during the entire process of this ceremony...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their eyes and their thoughts had been entirely filled with that human figure that was covered in blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scattering flames still continued to burn violently and in the blink of an eye, Xing Mingzi’s body had completely burned up and not even a bit of ash remained. It was at this moment that the flames on Yun Che’s body and sword finally began to gutter out. In the air above, the Golden Crow Manifest God began to fade out of existence. The Heaven Smiting Sword heavily slammed into the ground: and his body also sank to its knees as his head dipped… and there was no more movement from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A very light breeze blew across the area, but it was able to carry away most of the blood stench and malicious energy lingering in the air. That dreadful oppressive might had disappeared, and the only things that were left were an icy-coldness and dread that would sink into their bones for the rest of their lives, a coldness and dread that caused all the Star Guards to shake uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is he… dead?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; “……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet another light breeze blew across the area, causing the malicious energy and blood stench to grow even milder. Yun Che still did not move even a single muscle. His right arm was a shattered stump, his entire body was covered in wounds, but no blood pooled below his body… Perhaps all the blood in his body had run dry a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dead… He’s dead!!” An excited shout rang out in the air but the person’s voice was shaking as they said those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just that even though they faced a completely motionless Yun Che, a Yun Che whose aura and lifeforce seemed to have completely evaporated, a Yun Che who was very likely already dead, not a single one of these Star Guards made a move to advance towards him, even after a very long time had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you waiting for! Hurry up and finish him off!” Heavenly Origin Star God Tumi said in a deep voice as he looked at these Star Guards who had clearly been scared witless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Star Guards had been so pathetic in any other situation, he would have been thoroughly disappointed with them and he would have felt a deep shame. But right now, however, he did not feel the least bit angry. Because even he and even the Star God Emperor himself felt an uncontrollable feeling of alarm and fear stir in their hearts, much less these Star Guards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He once again rejoiced. He rejoiced with an incomparable intensity, he rejoiced that Yun Che was still young and full of youthful vigor, so much so that he was willing to stupidly rush to his death for Jasmine’s sake. If not… if not… if he could have endured it just a little longer, in the not too distant future, the Star God Realm would have been struck by a huge and incredibly dreadful catastrophe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, if he had these thoughts and was filled with such rejoicing, then would the Star God Emperor and the other Star Gods be any different?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite the Heavenly Origin Star God’s orders, the world still remained quiet for several more breaths. Following that, the twelve Star Guards that were in the most advanced position finally rose up together as they rushed towards Yun Che in unison, the profound light on their bodies shone the brightest it could in the shortest amount of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing this “dead man” who no longer moved and whose aura and lifeforce had completely dissipated, all twelve of these Star Guards unleashed their full power and not a single one of them held back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They&nbsp;could have only been scared witless by Yun Che!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che still remained motionless and in the end, that managed to erase the deep and heavy fear and shadow in these Star Guards’ hearts… But, just as the power of these twelve Star Guards came into contact with Yun Che, the head which had sagged downwards for the longest time suddenly jerked up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gaze which seemed as solid as fresh blood fiercely pierced into the eyes of all twelve Star Guards. In the blink of an eye, the now easily frightened and already jittery Star Guards all felt as if their souls had flown straight to heaven and the Divine Sovereign power that neared Yun Che no longer pressed down fiercely. Instead, it was being retracted in panic and fear… It was a completely unconscious and involuntary attempt to retract their power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che did not rise. Instead, he flung out his left arm as the howl of Heavenly Wolf pierced the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sword blow did not contain any fire because the Golden Crow divine blood and the Phoenix divine blood had been burned up at the same time, but the might contained within the blow was still peerlessly tyrannical. It forcefully dispersed the power of the twelve Star Guards, a power which had become extremely unstable due to their shock and fear. After that, the aftershock of that attack swept across their bodies, sending them flying into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the Star Guards who were in the back let out strange cries, it was as if they had personally witnessed a slumbering devil god being roused. Most of the Star Guards started to retreat in panic, their legs shaking as they did so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BANG!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heaven Smiting Sword once again smashed into the ground as Yun Che also sank to his knees heavily and went motionless yet again. The twelve Star Guards who had been blasted away got to their feet as they trembled. Once they had regained some of their composure, they realized… that their bodies were entirely whole. The Star Guard Armor they were wearing was not even scratched and they had not sustained any injuries whatsoever!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The miserable states of those Star Guards… including the Star Guard commanders Xing Ling and Xing Lou when they had died were still vivid in their minds. Yet they had actually come out completely unscathed despite being hit by the might of Yun Che’s sword. Once they had recovered from their shock and fear, the wild joy of having survived crazily surged up in their hearts, and the fear and dread that also lay within were now greatly diminished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s done… He’s already done!” The Star Guards in the middle roared with excitement, “Advance… All of us, advance!”</span></p>

With that one command, many Star Guards pushed forward together, as if they could not wait to rip him apart with their bare hands, and avenge themselves and their previous humiliation in one fell swoop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if he could sense them surging forward as the Yun Che, who knelt on the ground, started to move once again. This time, he did not stand, he only raised the arm that was holding a sword. It was as if he found even handling the Heaven Smiting Sword exceptionally challenging with his remaining strength. His actions were incomparably slow, and it was only when most of the Star Guards had rushed to within three hundred meters of him that he finally raised his arm up and pointed his sword at the blue sky.</span></p>

The shock produced by this clap of thunder very nearly shocked all the Star Guards off their feet. Amidst this heaven-shaking thunderclap, a deep purple lightning bolt, that came out of nowhere, struck the sword in Yun Che’s hand. Following that, it coursed through the body of the sword and entered Yun Che’s body as violent flashes and crackles of lightning appeared around him.</span></p>

Their bodies also suddenly and fiercely froze as they stared straight at the Heaven Smiting Sword that was slowly falling after being pointed to the sky. The movement was very slow and every angle of its trajectory could be seen with incomparable clarity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The instant the body of the sword touched the ground, a purple-colored curtain of lightning suddenly spread over the sky before their very eyes. This curtain of light explosively expanded at a speed which did not allow them to react at all, engulfing them within it. The sound of thunder was now belatedly exploding in their ears.</span></p>

Furthermore, every single strand of electricity, every single bolt of lightning was made up of the true and genuine power of the heavenly law. Within the roiling and seething sea of lightning, space had already become completely distorted as the very earth itself was being shattered, layer by layer. Moreover, the Star Guards who were buried within were being shredded apart. Their protective profound energy was being shredded, their Star Guard Armor was being shredded, their bodies and internal organs were being shredded, until the point where they were completely shredded into countless fragments which were getting tinier and more broken with each passing instant...</span></p>
