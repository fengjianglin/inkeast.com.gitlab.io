 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because this would be Yun Che’s final match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the most eye catching dark horse of this year’s Conferred God Battle and the man who utterly shook the entire Eastern Divine Region, it was only natural that everyone wanted to witness his final performance. This was especially true for the profound practitioners of middle and lower star realms. They all thought of Yun Che as their pride and glory, so there was no way they were going to miss his final battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were almost no empty marked seats in the spectator stands of the Conferred God Stage. It was obvious that the youngsters weren’t the only ones who wanted to see Yun Che. Those peak experts that stood at the top of the Eastern Divine Region would never admit it in the open but in their subconscious, they all thought that Yun Che was someone they must pay attention to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Sovereign and Jun Xilei had arrived a long time ago, but not Yun Che. It wasn’t until the last minute that a heat wave approached from afar, Huo Rulie flying through the air with great speed while holding Yun Che. They both landed in the middle of the spectator stands, the trail of fire Huo Rulie left behind not dissipating for a very long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wah!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A crisp, joyful and absolutely melodious cry reached nearly everyone’s ears as Shui Meiyin jumped into the air. “It’s Big Brother Yun Che, Big Brother Yun Che is here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless profound cultivators twirled their eyes and shot Shui Meiyin an odd look at the same time. Sweat poured down Shui Qianheng’s head as he scolded her in a small voice, “Don’t shout, that’s very impolite!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yun Che’s profound strength… is at the ninth stage of the Divine Tribulation Realm?” Shui Yingyue frowned slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! The boy didn’t show up for your fight against Luo Changsheng, and he wasn’t heard from at all for the past few days. That means he had to be cultivating in secret for today’s battle. I didn’t think he would actually make a breakthrough though.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Qianheng continued in a disapproving tone, “It’s only been a few days, so he must have used the Time Wheel Pearl. Still, if he thinks he’s a match for Jun Xilei just because his realm went up a small stage, then I must say that he’s too naive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Daddy, you’re totally wrong.” Shui Meiyin pressed her lips together in dissatisfaction, but her eyes quickly turned sparkly a second later, “I have a feeling that my Big Brother Yun Che has become a lot stronger… As expected of my Big Brother Yun Che.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Y-y-you!” Shui Qianheng’s face distorted when he saw his precious daughter staring at Yun Che like a love-struck fool, but what could he do? Scold her? Beat her? In the end, he had no choice but to glare piercingly at Yun Che. “That brat… if we weren’t entering the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm soon, I’d ha… Hmph…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...Daddy, what did you mutter just now?” Shui Meiyin looked sideways and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...I didn’t say anything. Your ears must be fooling you,” Shui Qianheng turned his head away and answered innocently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s arrival had attracted everyone’s attention, so of course they noticed his improvement as well. However, it was just a minor surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Yun Che and Jun Xilei’s overall strength were close, a small increase in level could definitely tip the balance in his favor. However, the gap between Yun Che and Jun Xilei couldn’t be bridged by something that minor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Congratulations for your breakthrough, Brother Yun!” Huo Poyun said cheerfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s all thanks to Sect Master Huo’s aid and the Time Wheel Pearls you gave me,” Yun Che replied with a smile. He then looked around the Conferred God Stage and allowed his gaze to sweep past Jun Xilei’s figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Juehai and Mu Bingyun both stared at Yun Che with odd looks on their faces. They were the ones standing closest to Yun Che, so they could sense that an increase in profound strength was not the only thing that had changed about Yun Che. A sense of heaviness was radiating from Yun Che’s body… something they had never felt before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The seventh match of the Conferred God Battle Losers Group will be Yun Che from the Snow Song Realm versus Jun Xilei, the Sword Sovereign’s successor. Both participants, please enter the Conferred God Stage now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che immediately got up and grew focused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But just as he was about to leap into the stage, Mu Bingyun suddenly caught his arm and said, “Yun Che, Jun Xilei holds a serious grudge against you so it’s very likely that she’ll try to wound you severely on purpose… be very, very careful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che turned around and shot her a “don’t worry” look. He even gripped the back of her hand slightly in reassurance. Before Mu Bingyun could recover from her surprise, Yun Che had already jumped into the air and landed on the Conferred God Stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Bingyun, “...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jun Wuming stared at Yun Che for a long time before his pale white eyebrows furrowed slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lei’er… please promise me two things before you fight Yun Che.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please instruct me, master.” Jun Xilei bowed her head respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“First, you must not underestimate your enemy!” Jun Wuming said seriously, “It has only been a few days, but this boy feels a lot different than he did before. You must be careful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Jun Xilei promised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Second,” Jun Wuming paused for a moment before continuing, “You may beat him, but you musn’t wound him severely on purpose!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words held far more weight this time. There was a reason behind this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His recent trip to the Snow Song Realm had made him invariably wary of Mu Xuanyin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He himself was about to run out of lifespan, so he didn’t care if Mu Xuanyin might threaten his life. However, he was afraid that Jun Xilei might perish at Mu Xuanyin’s hands. It wasn’t her unnaturally powerful profound strength that he was afraid of, but her temper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back in the Snow Song Realm, Mu Xuanyin had bowed and acted differentially to him in the way a junior would to a senior. But after Jun Xilei had offended Yun Che, Mu Xuanyin had immediately turned hostile, gave him a harsh scolding, and slapped Jun Xilei in the face. She even kicked them out of the Snow Song Realm at the very end, as if the title “Sword Sovereign”—a title that awed and bowed the heads of upper star realms—meant less than a speck of dust to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was probably impossible to find another person like her in the entire God Realm.</span></p>

That was how protective she was over Yun Che. The consequences were unimaginable if that really were to happen.</span></p>

Her gaze was calm and chilly, and an invisible sword was raging across the stage even before she used her profound energy. In an instant, it was as if ten thousand invisible swords were pointing towards Yun Che at once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Sovereign’s successor’s sword intent was nothing to scoffed at. At first, Yun Che looked completely calm as he stubbornly matched gazes with Jun Xilei. However, his eyes began to roam, and his complexion gradually turned pale just a few breaths later. In the end, his breathing had become completely erratic, and his body wobbled non-stop as if he was about to fall over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Neither combatant had summoned their profound energy or engaged each other in combat yet; it was just a clash of auras and nothing more. But Yun Che was still the clear loser of this clash, and many were shaking their heads, sighing from the spectator stands. Yet no one was surprised by this result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She truly is the Sword Sovereign’s succesor. To think that her sword intent would be this powerful despite her young age,” Mu Huanzhi sighed. “It will be very… difficult for Yun Che to do anything against her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She’s oppressing Brother Yun with her sword intent before the match has even started! She’s clearly trying to embarrass Brother Yun!” Huo Poyun said angrily.</span></p>

She was aware of the grudge between Yun Che and Jun Xilei, and she knew that she should be impressed that Yun Che had managed to hold out this far. If the one on the stage was someone else, they might have surrendered in fear before the match even began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Honorable Qi Hui frowned slightly. He had plenty of life experience, and he could clearly see the hate Jun Xilei harbored against Yun Che. It was no small hatred either.</span></p>

Finally, he waved a hand and declared, “Begin!”</span></p>

Misty Light exited its sheath, and a pale white beam instantly appeared between Yun Che and Jun Xilei.</span></p>

Although the horizontal flash was half an instant slower than the sword beam, the burst of divine might had suddenly clenched around everyone’s heart like an invisible hand.</span></p>

They vomited blood in midair again and again before they finally crashed against the ground several hundred meters away. The terrible sword might that had caused this continued to envelop more than half of the Conferred God Stage like an undying fog.</span></p>

Even now, blood was pouring out of her pale white lips like a water tap. It was clear to everyone that she had suffered extremely serious internal injuries, and her eyes had completely lost their previous sharpness and chill. There was only murky emptiness in her eyes; a kind of look one might have if they had suddenly fallen into the abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che was leaning backwards with a bloody hole in his chest area. However, his chest wasn’t completely pierced through. He slowly bent forward and stood straight once more. He didn’t take a step backwards despite the piercing blow, almost as if someone had nailed his feet to the ground with a pair of actual nails. His chest had also stopped bleeding on its own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pretense that he was suppressed by Jun Xilei’s invisible sword intent was completely gone. Right now, Yun Che was staring down on the heavily wounded Jun Xilei, coldly and loftily, like a ten-thousand year old pine tree. The huge vermillion sword he was holding didn’t burn brightly with power, but it felt like a giant abyss creature that had completely awakened from its deep slumber all the same. It was as if the entire Conferred God Stage was trapped inside its terrible maw right now.</span></p>

The entire Eastern Divine Region might be rioting due to that instantaneous exchange, however, Yun Che wore a calm look on his face. Not only did he not try to press home the attack, he was holding the Heaven Smiting Sword and staring at the absent-minded Jun Xilei’s figure coolly. The corners of his lips turned up indiscernibly.</span></p>

It didn’t take a genius to figure out that she would only act worse when her opponent was him.</span></p>

If she could beat him just like the day she took down Huo Poyun, with one strike, she could instantly turn him into “the laughingstock who was taken down instantly by the Sword Sovereign’s disciple”, no matter how famous he had gotten earlier.</span></p>

He also assumed that she would use a technique that was far crueler and more merciless than the one she used against Huo Poyun.</span></p>

Even if Jun Xilei did catch him off guard, there was no guarantee that she could take him down in a single strike. That was why she had unleashed her sword intent and tried to terrify him even before the fight began… Sword intent was a forcefield that appeared naturally to someone who practiced the way of the sword. Since it was not connected to profound energy, it didn’t count as a breach of the rules.</span></p>

The moment Honorable Qu Hui declared the start of the match, Jun Xilei had immediately injected the highest amount of profound energy and sword intent she could muster into her Misty Light Sword and fired a sword beam at Yun Che.</span></p>
