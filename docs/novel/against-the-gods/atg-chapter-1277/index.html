She was born in the Moon God Realm and was even chosen to serve the future god empress. Her status was definitely far above the majority of the profound practitioners who lived in the Moon God Realm. At the very least, she would not be a timid person who was prone to losing her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in front of Yun Che, she could not shake this feeling of unease and nervousness that had dogged her since the start of the conversation, and she especially did not dare to meet his gaze directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jin Yue will be taking her leave.” Yun Che did not know whether she had remembered his instructions as he watched her hurriedly leave the area.</span></p>

Just what is going on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Yun Che and Mu Bingyun did not reply.</span></p>

After she had reached God Realm, Xia Qingyue would naturally gradually become aware of the fact that the Frozen End Divine Art that she had cultivated in Frozen Cloud Immortal Palace was actually the Snow Song Realm’s Ice Phoenix God Investiture Canon.</span></p>

He immediately tried to wipe himself clean in a fluster before he stammered out a response, “I… I… I… I… I didn’t hear anything just now, nothing at all…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As if he was afraid Huo Poyun would run his mouth and ask stupid questions, he disregarded his pathetic appearance and grabbed Huo Poyun as he said, “Poyun, your master still has many important things to talk to you about. After you enter the Eternal Heaven Pearl… Blah blah….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The marriage contract between her and I…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was some f*cking bolt out of the blue. In fact Huo Rulie, Yan Juehai, and Mu Huanzhi, three great Divine Sovereigns, had all been blasted so hard that they were rendered completely dumbfounded right there and then. The news was so big that they felt as if they were drowning in a boundless and endless tidal wave…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I… will go take a look at our disciples.” Mu Huanzhi’s forehead was filled with sweat and when he stood up, he staggered as he tripped over his chair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cough… I will go as well.” Yan Juehai, who was normally as calm and steady as a mountain, seemed to almost be running away as he left the scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So it looks like you don’t believe what that maidservant told you just now?” Mu Bingyun said as she looked at Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, I do believe her,” Yun Che said impassively. “She must not have seen the profound images that captured the Profound God Convention, nor does she know that I am alive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why do you say that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Because I understand her.” Yun Che lightly closed his eyes as he was recalling some unknown memory, “She is really a person who possesses an extremely retiring and passive personality, she has been like that since she was a child. The profound way has always been her only pursuit, and she was completely indifferent to anything besides that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Bingyun, “...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even though she did not see the profound images that captured the Profound God Convention, she definitely did hear of my name. It’s just that…” Yun Che said as he gave a self-deprecating chuckle, “It was not possible for her to link me with the ‘Yun Che’ that she had heard about.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just like when he had first heard the Moon God Emperor say the name “Qingyue”, he had definitely never thought that she would be Xia Qingyue, he did not even think there was the slightest possibility it would be her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because it was impossible for him to connect Xia Qingyue with the “Moon God Empress”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Likewise, it was even less likely for her to link the “Number One in the Conferred God Battle” to him… To say nothing of someone whom she thought was already dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Mu Bingyun looked at Yun Che in silence. Yun Che’s words told her that in Xia Qingyue’s world, “Yun Che” was her ex-husband who had died many years ago. So it was completely up to her whether she wanted to marry someone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words were spoken for Mu Bingyun’s benefit, or perhaps, they were spoken to console himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since she is someone with a retiring and passive temperament, she naturally will not covet the title of ‘Moon God Empress’. So perhaps, she is being forced to do so, or there are some difficult circumstances behind her choice?” Mu Bingyun said as she tried to console Yun Che. “After all, if the Moon God Emperor wants someone to become his god empress, it would be impossible for that person to reject him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No,” Yun Che said with a shake of his head, “she is indeed someone who will not covet the title of ‘god empress’ but she is also someone who will not be coerced by anyone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Bingyun, “...?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Palace Master Bingyun, when I got married to her twelve years ago, she was already being pursued by countless admirers. Furthermore, she had also already been accepted as an official disciple of Frozen Cloud Immortal Palace. However, the me at that time was someone who had a weak body and crippled profound veins, and even the servants within my own family would mock me in secret.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The gap between heaven and earth was not even sufficient to describe the distance between the two of us. Yet she still agreed to get married to me, and it definitely was not because she was forced, nor were there some difficult circumstances compelling her to do so. Rather, it was entirely of her own free will.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Mu Bingyun was left slightly dumbfounded at those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The me at that time was not only grateful to her but adored her as well. On the first day that we were married, I had decided in my heart that no matter what status she had, I would definitely cause her to truly fall in love with me… It was also probably to satisfy that somewhat laughable dignity of mine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought of the few days they had spent together as newlyweds all those years ago, Yun Che could not help but give a quiet chuckle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After that, I had many female soulmates and as I interacted with them, they would gradually include me in their lives and their thoughts. Even Caiyi, who was the Little Demon Empress, was the same. But… only Xia Qingyue…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I bowed to the heavens and earth together with her, I went through trials and tribulations with her and we even survived life and death situations together. There were so many occasions when&nbsp;I had thought that I had finally completely melted her heart of ice… Especially that one time when I had been swallowed together with her by an enormous beast in the Heaven Basin. In order to save me, she transferred all her energy into my body and nearly lost her own life as a result…”</span></p>

Perhaps, it was due to the Heart of Glazed Glass in her body, so she was always subconsciously overlooking every thing and every person in this world. So no one could force her to do anything, it was only whether she agreed to do it or not.”</span></p>
