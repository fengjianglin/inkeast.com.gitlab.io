His ability to control the elements is breathtaking. He is just at the Divine Origin Realm and cultivates ice attribute profound arts, yet he is actually able to stay here for an hour. Even my fellow Flame God disciples at the Divine Origin Realm would not be able to endure for this long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, look at me. I actually forgot about this. Poyun, please take Young Yun and go rest for a while,” Huo Rulie hastily said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is no need.” Yun Che wiped away the sweat on his forehead and then waved his hand as he said, “Brother Poyun, for a matter such as this, if one misses even the slightest bit, it will become something which they will never be able to fill. Moreover, I am merely just moving slightly farther away to rest for a while. It is not some major issue. Why would I need someone to accompany me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Yun Che quickly departed with ragged breaths, “Brother Poyun, I will be back soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah… okay.” Huo Poyun subconsciously stepped forward but after thinking about Yun Che’s words, he decided to remain where he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a clash between two Divine Masters before them, no one wanted to miss even a single instant of what was happening. Thus, as Yun Che left, no one paid him a single glance. Their eyes were all glued to the Vermillion Bird projection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che increased his speed and soon, he was many kilometers away. Afterwards, he stopped behind a tall firestone. Upon confirming that there were indeed no auras locked onto him, he quickly used Hidden Flowing Lightning to hide his own aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, now is the perfect time for me to sneak into the God Burying Inferno Prison,” Yun Che silently thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A land containing five hundred thousand kilometers of relics of the Divine Realm. Perhaps there would be a treasure which would allow him to break directly through to the Divine Tribulation Realm within its depths… it was not unlikely!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che retracted his aura and then began to slowly move eastward for several kilometers before turning towards the edge of the Inferno Prison. When he was only a few kilometers from the edge, he used Moon Splitting Cascade out of caution, causing his figure to momentarily become indiscernible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Using Moon Splitting Cascade along with Hidden Flowing Lightning allowed him to become extremely hidden. Adding on how the three Flame God Sect Masters were all focused on the Vermillion Bird projection… it should be practically impossible for him to to be discovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che took slow steps as he carefully and delicately approached the edge of the sea of flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he predicted, he was able to quickly reach the edge of the Inferno Prison without any mishaps. There wasn’t even a single aura sweeping across the area. Yun Che slightly exhaled in relief as he continued maintaining his retracted aura and silently jumped into the boundless prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s body instantly and completely disappeared into the roiling waves of fire. His state of concealment faded as he became submerged and an extremely high level energy of combustion surged over him from all directions. Afterwards, the energy turned into currents of warm air and gushed into Yun Che’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the sea of fire, Yun Che was able to sense the energy fluctuations from the clash far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon entering the sea of flames, Yun Che’s body quickly sank. In the blink of an eye, he had already fallen three kilometers into its depths… From what Huo Poyun had told him earlier, this was the limit of what Yan Wancang’s mental energy could sense. This meant that after this depth, regardless of how hard the three Flame God Sect Masters used their spirit sense, they would not be able to discover him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the same with the Heavenly Netherfrost Lake. The deeper one went, the more horrifying the blaze energy of the God Burying Inferno Prison became. Upon reaching a depth of three kilometers, the flames had already reached a level which completely surpassed his imagination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just a single cluster of the flames here is probably enough to evaporate an entire sea in a lower realm,” Yun Che thought to himself. “This is only three kilometers in, yet it has already become so terrifying. It’s even more impossible to imagine what it’ll be like even further down. Such a terrifying place. Not only does this cover five hundred thousand kilometers, it has also continuously burned for hundreds of thousands of years without weakening in the slightest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The origin of all this energy is the flame vein… sigh,” Yun Che gently sighed. The flame vein was something left over from the Primordial Era of True Gods. The Era of True Gods who were even able to control the Primal Chaos. To the beings of today, the True Gods were truly a group of unimaginable and incomprehensible beings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the ability to control the power of the Primal Chaos emerged again—in the face of the power of True Gods, Divine Master Realm experts were only insignificant bugs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che stopped sighing to himself as he felt the blaze aura surge up towards him from below. He stopped thinking about this matter as he circulated his profound energy and descended into the depths of the world of fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Six kilometers…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine kilometers…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Twelve kilometers…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fifteen kilometers!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a streak of crimson red light suddenly arced through the sky in the distance, catching Yun Che’s eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this place where the flames had already become so hot that they couldn’t be described by any mortal words; any color was completely obstructed by the glow of flames. Yet the crimson red light was extremely clear as it arced through the distance. Even in this purgatory like world, it remained clear and dazzling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s figure slowly came to a stop at this moment… because his profound energy was no longer able to extend down any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Below his feet was the end of the God Burying Inferno Prison!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s two feet stood on some sturdy and flat solid surface. It felt like a rock but there were no rocks in Yun Che’s consciousness, not even some miraculous ageless rock, which would not immediately melt upon contact with the flames here. Perhaps the “rocks” at the bottom of the Inferno Prison were also remnants from the True God Era.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spirit energy of fire was like a hurricane as it surged into his body. However, the rate of absorption had reached its limit since the depth of three thousand meters. The only change after one thousand meters was… the exact same change which had occurred after one thousand meters in the Heavenly Netherfrost Lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the depth of this God Burying Inferno Prison was very similar to the depth of the Heavenly Netherfrost Lake, about fifteen kilometers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The extreme pureness of the energy here was also comparable to the energy in the depths of the Heavenly Netherfrost Lake. The world here was a terrifying hell which no one could possibly imagine. Yun Che remained here for a long while as the notion that he was “able to survive here” emerged into his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Remembering his initial goal for coming here, Yun Che once again began to quickly move forward. The flames at the bottom of the God Burying Inferno Prison were indeed unable to block his five sense or reduce his speed. They only became a source of strength for him. However, the God Burying Inferno Prison extended over five hundred thousand kilometers. Searching for treasures, relics, and other such things here was the same as trying to find a needle in a haystack. But when Yun Che made the decision to enter this place, he had already decided to try his luck. Moreover, he wasn’t just choosing some random direction, but the direction in which there was the arcing crimson red light in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was extremely likely that the arcing streak of crimson red light was the primordial flame vein which was supporting the God Burying Inferno Prison!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Yun Che moved towards the arcing crimson red light, he directly passed through cluster after cluster of flames as he moved in a straight line. Although he moved quickly, the scene around him seemed to remain the same. His feet landed upon the same strange rock and he was still completely surrounded by flames. The temperature and aura were also completely unchanged. Compared to the Heavenly Netherfrost Lake, it was the opposite kind of pure but it was just too many times larger.</span></p>

He had now been moving in the same direction for over four hours, yet he had not found a single treasure or relic and there had not been the slightest change in aura. The only difference was that the arcing crimson red light in his vision had grown much larger.</span></p>

It was as if some kind of ancient sound had heavily rapped against his heart and soul for a moment.</span></p>

However, he had just moved a couple tens of meters before a huge shadow abruptly appeared before him. Abruptly, a faint change occurred in the aura around him.</span></p>

It seemed like every time the dragon appeared to shed its scales, it would always deliberately move very far south because it was afraid of destroying its lair during battle.</span></p>

There was nothing except the thick aura of a horned dragon!</span></p>

Then, he was startled.</span></p>

In fact, it wasn’t just similar, but basically identical than the one he was in earlier.</span></p>

Not only did it build two lairs for itself, they even looked exactly the same. What was the point of having two lairs then?</span></p>

They didn’t affect Yun Che in the slightest, however. Although the lair also had a horned dragon’s aura, Yun Che’s spiritual perception was exceptionally acute. He had just gotten out of the first lair, so he remembered the dragon’s aura very clearly. However, a sense of disharmony had arisen in his mind when he came to this lair.</span></p>

A moment later, he swiftly returned and entered the second lair. Then, he went back again into the first lair.</span></p>

Because the two ancient horned dragons had an extremely similar aura to one another and they always appeared in turns every one thousand years, no one was able to distinguish the difference. Worse, their auras were completely undetectable when they hid inside the God Burying Inferno Prison.</span></p>
