 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course,” he said with a bland laugh, “it is also very possible that this crack in the Wall of Primal Chaos is nothing more than a crimson illusion. So, you also don’t need to give yourselves too much pressure, and there is even less need for your hearts and minds to become disordered by this. Dutifully improve yourselves within the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm. Do not squander this sort of opportunity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please do not worry, Eternal Heaven God Emperor,” Lu Lengchuan spoke up. “As the sons and daughters of the Eastern Divine Region, if a calamity truly does break out in the future, even if we did not have this opportunity, that was bestowed upon us by the Eternal Heaven Realm, we would also devote all our strength in stopping this calamity, even if it costs us our lives.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If someone else had said the words that Lu Lengchuan had just said, it might very well be a very passionate form of flattery, but every word that came out of his mouth was as resolute and solid as iron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eternal Heaven God Emperor glanced at Lu Lengchuan, he gave a small nod and a faint smile as a look of admiration appeared on his face. After that, he said, “After you have entered the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm, you will have a small independent world to yourselves and unless you yourselves allow it, no one else will be able to enter the small worlds of the others. Whether you want to focus on your cultivation independently or whether you want to join your forces and cultivate together, it is up to your own wishes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, once the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm closes, it will only open up three years later. As such, during the ‘three thousand years’ that you are inside the realm, there will be no way for you to get out. So if any incidents happen, there will also be no one who can help you. So if there is anyone who feels repulsed or terrified of these upcoming ‘three thousand years’, you can bow out, there is no one who will force you to undertake this task.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one replied to him… Because there would not be anyone who would reject such an unprecedented and enormous opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good.” After that the Eternal Heaven God Emperor gave a brief nod of his head. With a small wave of his arm, the world around them immediately lit up with a dense white glow, “The Eternal Heaven Divine Realm has been opened. Once you enter, it will mean three thousand years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In three years' time, I hope that the young and tender youths who have gathered here today will be able to become yet another power for the Eastern Divine Region that can reach the heavens.” Every single word that the Eternal Heaven God Emperor said carried a deep hope, “Go on in then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait a minute!” Just as the Eternal Heaven God Emperor’s voice had fallen, four anxious voices rang out in the air simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Lengchuan, Huo Poyun, and Shui Meiyin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Astonishingly enough, the other person was actually Luo Changsheng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Poyun took a step forward as he spoke in an anxious voice, “Brother Yun Che, he…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eternal Heaven God Emperor raised a hand before giving a slow shake of his head, “Actually, all of you should have entered the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm this morning. But now, it is already evening. Sigh, such is the will of heaven.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che, the divine child that had radiated such heaven-shaking brilliance on that Conferred God Stage. There was no doubt that the Eternal Heaven God Emperor was more disappointed and disconsolate than anyone else at the fact that Yun Che was not able to enter the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were the young people who had all demonstrated their extraordinary skills and talents during the Profound God Convention, and all of them were so young that they were below sixty years of age. So for Yun Che not to enter the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm meant that there would be a whole three thousand year gap between them and him once they had emerged!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the level of the aura in the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm was not only exceptionally high, but it also allowed any profound practitioner who cultivated there to be truly free of all distractions. So the three thousand years within this realm was comparable to six thousand years in the outside world… and even if one were to say it was the equivalent of ten thousand years, it would not be deemed as unwarranted or excessive talk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This also meant that after three years, the Yun Che who had originally reigned above them all would become as tiny as a speck in front of them. Even the weakest among them would far exceed Yun Che in strength and level once these three years had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They would become the cornerstones of the Eastern Divine Region while Yun Che, who had not entered the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm would remain a “god child” from the younger generation… and nothing more than that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The time has come, put aside all thoughts which may distract you. From today onwards, all of the profound practitioners in the Eastern Divine Region will eagerly anticipate the moment all of you emerge from the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm. I hope that three years from now, every single one of you will be able to radiate a light that will illuminate the entire Eastern Divine Region.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eternal Heaven God Emperor gave a push of his hand as a pure wind, that could not be resisted, immediately swept all of the young profound practitioners into the white light behind them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The world behind them immediately glowed with a strong white light. Several breaths later, after the white light had dissipated, the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm had slowly sealed itself, and the young profound practitioners who had been sent into that place would only be able to emerge after three years had passed. Moreover, after spending three thousand years in the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm, each and every one of them would undergo incredibly enormous changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was especially true for those young profound practitioners who had high hopes placed on them, the ones who possessed extraordinary talent. It was very likely that they would go from being excellent and famous people from the younger generation to personages who would be able to reach the highest level in the Eastern Divine Region, or perhaps even the highest level in the entire Realm of the Gods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet Yun Che, the one who had the greatest expectations placed upon him, just had to be the person who had missed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eternal Heaven Divine Emperor himself actually had the unique right to freely enter and exit the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm. But since Yun Che was not among those who had entered, his interest had waned and he no longer entertained this idea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the heaven chosen children had entered the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm, yet the Eternal Heaven God Emperor had not left the place yet. He looked at the empty world in front of him before he suddenly gave a heavy sigh of lament, “Oh Ancestor, if he arrives here afterwards, is there truly no way for us to reopen the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm for him? This child’s performance and the strange state of his body were something that you personally witnessed yourself. &nbsp;Even though it is hard to completely believe the words regarding him ‘becoming a True God’, given his ceiling, he might just be able to truly break through all the known limits and ceilings at this point. As such, if the crimson calamity truly erupts in the future, he would have become our greatest and most brilliant hope at that time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the king realms, they always desired to become ever stronger, but at the same time, they definitely did not want anyone to become stronger than them. Yun Che’s “nine stage lightning tribulation”, “child of the heavens” and “True God Prophecy”... every single one of them had fiercely plucked at the nerves of all the great king realms, causing them to shake from shock and covet his powers… to the point where they envied or even feared him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of them wanted to know the secrets behind Yun Che’s aptitude and natural endowments. If they could, none of them would spare anything to steal him for themselves… if they were not able to, when Yun Che truly started to display strength which surpassed all understanding, they would definitely start plotting to wipe him from the face of this earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the peak existences within this Primal Chaos Dimension, the king realms would definitely not allow anything stronger than them to emerge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only exception to this rule was the Eternal Heaven God Realm—this was a king realm that had followed the righteous path since the advent of its existence, a king realm that was revered by all the profound practitioners in the Eastern Divine Region. As the realm king of the Eternal Heaven Realm, the Eternal Heaven God Emperor truly admired the freak that was Yun Che, and he also truly wished to see him become strong and become the glorious light of the Eastern Divine Region, so that he could also become the strongest power that could oppose that calamity in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he had never envied or coveted Yun Che, and he had definitely not thought of killing him.</span></p>

Even Jasmine had emphasized one thing to Yun Che. She had stressed to him that he should not leave the Eternal Heaven Realm at all before entering the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm, because the Eternal Heaven God Emperor definitely would not harm him.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To be able to open it once for that period of three thousand years is already the utmost limit of the Eternal Heaven Pearl’s power. Given the aura of primal chaos which grows more turbid with each passing day, I do not know how many years it will take for it to recover to the point where it could open up once more.”</span></p>

I’m worried that someone has already taken the opportunity to make a move against him in secret… The people who can actually mount a pursuit of the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace can be counted on one hand. However, each and every one of those people just so happen to be the ones who would most likely covet him the most. Sigh.”</span></p>

There are very few who believe, and there is only you who has no choice but to believe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eternal Heaven God Emperor could hear a dense heaviness that was far heavier than it was before in that distant voice. He furrowed his brows as he said, “Could it be that it has grown heavier yet again?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” The empty space remained silent for a long period of time.</span></p>

But it was at this moment, the voice which sounded as if it was coming from the ancient past once again rang out in the air, “Now that it reached this point, it is also time for me to tell you about ‘that matter’.”</span></p>

Instead it slowly said, “In the Ancient Era of the Gods, there were seven great Heavenly Profound Treasures—the Heaven Punishing Ancestral Sword, the Evil Infant's Wheel of Myriad Tribulations, the Primordial Seal of Life and Death, the Eternal Heaven Pearl, the Sky Poison Pearl, the World Piercer, and the Mirror of Samsara. Four of these belonged to the god race, the other two belonged to the devil race and the final one fell into the lower realms.”</span></p>

After that, he froze for a long while before he gave heavy gasp and asked, “Why would the World Piercer be outside of the Primal Chaos Dimension? And just why would it… cause the Eternal Heaven Pearl to feel dread?”</span></p>

His entire body convulsed as his complexion instantly turned as pale as a ghost. Following that, his arms, legs, beard, and even his entire body started to tremble uncontrollably, “Could it… Could it… Could it be that… that… No… It’s not possible! It’s not possible that such an absurd thing could possibly happen!”</span></p>
