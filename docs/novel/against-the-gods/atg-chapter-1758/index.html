His entire body was drenched in blood and his face was unrecognizable. However, the golden clothes that this man wore were the world-renowned symbol of the Brahma Heaven God Emperor, something unique to him alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shock, fright, disbelief… flooded their hearts as the last bits of hope they were holding onto, the last bit of fighting spirit, completely and utterly collapsed.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The projections soon disappeared, plunging the Eastern Divine Region into a long period of deathly silence. One profound practitioner after the other sank to their knees limply, their beliefs and convictions completely destroyed.</span></p>

Once even the king realms had suffered such fates and made such choices, their continued resistance could only be seen as incomparably weak and laughable.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -----------------</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even so, just the Ninth Brahma King alone, someone whose cultivation had reached the ninth level of the Divine Master Realm, and the thirty-six Divine Masters that made up the ranks of the Brahma Monarch Elders constituted a huge amount of power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In their current depleted state, the Brahma Monarch God Realm was still far stronger than the Northern Divine Region’s Burning Moon Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, they even had Gu Zhu and the two Brahma Monarch Ancestors who had been forced out of their seclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they could gain control of all of these people, it would undoubtedly give them another absurdly strong fighting force.</span></p>

Even though her power had changed, she would never be able to change the Brahma Monarch blood which ran through her veins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Brahma Monarch blood also allowed her to gain complete control over the Brahma Soul Bell, and the person who controlled the Brahma Soul Bell also controlled the Brahma Monarch God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er looked completely calm on the surface, but her heart was thumping violently in her chest as her chaotic and restless emotions continued to surface in her trembling eyes. For the past few years, she firmly believed that she would do her best to kill Qianye Fantian the moment she saw him, that she would feel no hesitation or mercy toward him… At the same time, she would destroy everything that he treasured before his very eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, Qianye Fantian had finally died in front of her… and she had known exactly what he was trying to accomplish with his actions and words before he died. Yet, she had ended up choosing to go along with his plans in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though her personality had undergone a huge change during those few years she had spent in the Northern Divine Region, Qianye Fantian was still the person who understood her the best.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As her gaze coolly swept past the kneeling Brahma Kings and Brahma Monarch Elders, she gave her very first order. “Return to the Brahma Monarch God Realm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” The Third Brahma King took the lead as they all stood up and bowed towards Qianye Ying’er. However, not a single one of them dared to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Brahma Monarch God Realm had become both Yun Che’s and Qianye Ying’ers and there seemed to be no real difference between the two. However, the people of the Brahma Monarch God Realm would be able to swallow being ruled by the latter far easier than being ruled by the former.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Qianye Ying’er clearly had no intention to pass the Brahma Soul Bell to Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er flew into the air and boarded the Brahma Heaven Warship. Yun Che arrived at her side without saying a single word. Neither of them spoke as Qianye Ying’er rather dazedly stared towards the south. She did not move for a very long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only then that the Brahma Kings and Brahma Monarch Elders started to board the Brahma Heaven Warship… If Qianye Ying’er did not issue a command, they would not dare to make any unnecessary movements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, this was the best case scenario, something that Qianye Fantian had sacrificed everything for, including his own life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Brahma Heaven Warship started to hum, but just as it was about to shoot off into the air, Qianye Ying’er suddenly said, “Bring his body aboard as well, let’s not dirty more people’s eyes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the Brahma Kings shuddered before they tearfully replied, “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third and Fourth Brahma Kings personally went down to retrieve Qianye Fantian’s body. They arrived at his side… and just as they lifted the body up into the air, Qianye Ying’er’s eyes subtly darted toward him as she took one last look at Qianye Fantian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it lasted for only an incredibly short instant.</span></p>

However, she turned away slightly even as she uttered those cold words. Her eyes weren’t filled with coldness and hatred at this moment; a look of deeply-hidden complexity flashed through them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che stared into the distance before suddenly saying, “When the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor returned to the universe, he was the first to bend his knee and swear an oath of fervent loyalty. However, the moment the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor and Jasmine left my side, he was the first person who moved to kill me. When you could be exchanged for the greater good of the Brahma Monarch God Realm, he didn’t hesitate to throw you away, even though you were the apple of his eye, the daughter who had not hesitated to sacrifice her own life to save him.”</span></p>

Instead, he chose a most shameful and humiliating manner, all so he could preserve the Brahma Monarch God Realm and secretly pass the foundation he had protected all of his life to someone else.”</span></p>

However, I am very curious to know what exactly Qianye Fantian said to you at the very end which made you suddenly change your mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er turned away in a rather conspicuous manner as she replied in a bland voice, “If someone wants to give me a bunch of loyal dogs which will be at my every beck and call, why would I have any reason to reject them!?”</span></p>

As for the areas outside the Brahma Monarch Capital which had been struck by the Heaven Wounding Thought Severing Poison, not a single being had survived. In fact, not even their corpses remained.</span></p>

His pale face was twisting and grimacing due to the pain of the Sky Poison, but he still smiled gently at Qianye Ying’er as he repeated the words he used to say to her all the time. “Miss, you’ve returned.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The frigid coldness in Qianye Ying’er’s eyes instantly evaporated the moment she looked at Gu Zhu. She gave a gentle nod of her head as she said, “Yun Che, cure Uncle Gu of your poison.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che did not waste any time speaking.

He started to plead with them before he even bothered to regulate his breathing. “Could Miss and the Devil Master please show mercy and cure the ancestors of this poison? They will definitely become a huge strength for Miss and the Devil Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Strength?” Yun Che gave a chilling laugh. “I am the person who kicked your Brahma Monarch God Realm into hell with just a single action. Those two old men definitely hate me to the bone, so why should I save them!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Wugu and Qianye Bingzhu both stared deeply at Yun Che. They had only seen his visage through a projection before, this was the first time they had truly seen Yun Che… The young man who had dramatically transformed both the fate of the Eastern Divine Region and the Brahma Monarch God Realm in a stunningly short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no resentment or killing intent in their eyes. Instead, these two old men simply looked as if they had long grown weary of the comings and goings of this mortal world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If the Sky Poison isn’t cleansed, the Brahma Monarch Realm will certainly perish. This current situation can already be considered a gift from the heavens.” Qianye Wugu started to speak. “The two of us do not have many lingering desires, and we lost all of our hatred and ambition a long time ago. Now that Ying’er has become emperor, we will use all of our remaining life to assist her. The Devil Master need not worry about us.”</span></p>

Every single ray of that dazzling golden light was filled with a soul-penetrating cold. It was clear that this profound formation would unleash an incredible destructive force on anyone who even dared to approach it, much less touch it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er took out the Brahma Soul Bell and gave it a gentle shake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden profound formation immediately started to split apart as a pocket of space was slowly revealed below it. Another golden light shone from within the pocket of space, but it was entirely different from the light radiating from the golden profound formation. Not only did it lack offensive power, it was even as gentle as the rays of a setting sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go!” Qianye Ying’er grabbed Yun Che’s arm with a hand as she descended inside.</span></p>

This profound formation was only around twenty meters long but it very nearly filled up this tiny underground space.&nbsp;</span></p>

Instead, his eyes were fixed on the jade stone which was shining with a mild white light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked like a lustrous white jade disc about as wide as someone's palm. Bizarre divine runes were irregularly etched along its border and a piece of lustrous crystalline jade floated above it. It looked like a drop of water quietly floating in the air, a crystalline teardrop that had fallen from a beautiful woman’s eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no energy causing it to float and he could not sense the existence of any energy field either, yet this “drop of water” continued to quietly and bizarrely hover in the air.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che did not say anything. Instead, he slowly stepped into the center of the profound formation. It was such a tiny space that he only needed a few steps to reach his destination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Primordial Seal of Life and Death, the Heavenly Profound Treasure which was ranked third amongst them. It was also the Heavenly Profound Treasure that had driven the most people insane with desire… and it had been that way even during the Primordial Era.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because the one who obtained the Primordial Seal of Life and Death would also obtain eternal life.</span></p>
