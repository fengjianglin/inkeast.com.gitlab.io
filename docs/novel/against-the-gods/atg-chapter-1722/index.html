Fear and panic started to appear in their eyes, and it was as if all of them had been plunged into a nightmare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master!

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These one hundred and forty-three realm kings had responded to the call of the Eternal Heaven God Realm, and they had even brought all of their realm’s elite forces together with them!</span></p>

However, devil people had now appeared in the southern territories and started to attack their undefended homes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were stunned by these developments. Blood started draining from their faces as their bodies trembled violently… They could not believe what was happening. Why and how had the devils appeared in the southern territories?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the news, all their senses, told them that the devils had been running wild in the northern territories. Furthermore, the number of devil people far exceeded their wildest estimations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just how many devil people had the Northern Divine Region mobilized! Just how had they appeared in the southern territories!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Xuzi’s entire body went cold. He stared at Chi Wuyao and his voice trembled as he spoke. “What a great Devil Queen! What a great Northern Divine Region!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eternal Heaven God Emperor!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Zhou Xuzi had even finished speaking, a higher realm king yelled at him in a hoarse voice. He had practically scrambled to Zhou Xuzi and his face was warped as he yelled at him in a hoarse voice, “Hurry! The grand teleportation formation… Hurry up and activate the grand teleportation formation! My sect is under siege and I need to go back! I NEED TO GO BACK!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His hoarse, deafening roar startled and roused everyone, as if waking them up from a dream. None of the higher realm kings could even be bothered with the Devil Queen of the North at this moment. All of them rushed towards Zhou Xuzi as their eyes bulged out in extreme shock and fear. They started to yell and beg Zhou Xuzi in extremely hoarse voices.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hurry! The teleportation formation… Where is the teleportation formation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I don’t go back now, my sect is finished! The leader of the devils who are attacking my sect is very likely a level five Divine Master or stronger! Eternal Heaven God Emperor! ETERNAL HEAVEN GOD EMPEROR!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An energy wave exploded outwards. Under the power of the Guardians, all of the higher realm kings that were rushing toward Zhou Xuzi were fiercely shoved backwards. Zhou Xuzi sucked in a deep breath as he strove to compose himself. His voice was heavy and laced with pain as he said, “The grand dimensional formation’s foundation in the Eternal Heaven God Realm has been destroyed. We… were tricked by these devils.”</span></p>

Even if Zhou Xuzi and the six Guardians who had accompanied him had the power to traverse the heavens, there was no way they could build a dimensional formation that could connect the north and the south of the Eastern Divine Region in such a short amount of time.</span></p>

Even the dignified authority of the Eternal Heaven God Realm was completely useless under such circumstances. Zhou Qingfeng was also urging his father anxiously. “Royal father, we need to get back as fast as possible. Those invading devil people seem to be far more fearsome than we have even dreamed of.

But it was now also a face that seemed extremely unfamiliar to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His black eyes were like two dark abysses, his smile was practically demonic, and the moment his face appeared on that screen, the atmosphere in the entire Eastern Divine Region suddenly grew hushed and stifling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old dog Eternal Heaven.” His lips curled into a sinister smile as his voice reverberated in everyone’s ears like the curses of a bloodthirsty demon. “It’s been a long time. Are you satisfied with this greeting gift that I’ve sent you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Zhou Xuzi’s mouth gaped open. At some point in time, his eyes had turned scarlet red and his throat started moving up and down in a warped manner. A long time passed before he finally managed to whisper in a voice that sounded as dry and withered as a desiccated tree branch, “Yun… Che…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The last time we met in the Northern Divine Region, I casually squished one of your sons like a bug.” Yun Che gave a deep chuckle as he stretched out his hand and made the same crushing action he had made when he had obliterated Zhou Qingchen. “But since we’re meeting again under such splendid circumstances in the Eastern Divine Region, how can my greeting gift… be any lighter than that!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thrust a palm backwards and a beam of black light suddenly shot out from it… Zhou Xuzi’s pupils violently contracted as a tiny world hidden in the heart of the Eternal Heaven God Realm collapsed with a bang, flinging out its occupants. Several hundred people immediately appeared on the screen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment these figures were flung out of the tiny world, Zhou Xuzi immediately started howling like a wild beast… In the Eternal Heaven God Realm, the dazed Honorable Tai Yu spasmed as if thousands of swords had pierced his soul. He let out a furious roar that was as loud as thunder, “Run! Hurry up and run!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That tiny world that had just been destroyed had been created by their grand ancestor with the Great Void Cauldron. It was used as a hideaway when the Eternal Heaven God Realm was in great peril, and it was basically impossible to detect from the outside.</span></p>

His face was extremely ugly and his body was as dried and withered as a skeleton, but when his eyes turned toward the projection profound formation, the wild and sinister black light that flashed in those ancient eyes sent a chill down the spine of countless profound practitioners.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan One, the strongest Yama Ancestor.</span></p>
