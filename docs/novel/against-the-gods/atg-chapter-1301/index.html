Following that, he once again fell into that nightmarish abyss, and besides his hoarse cries of pain and his furious struggling, he did not say another complete word.</span></p>

To her, it seemed as if He Lin was the one who was painfully struggling and thrashing about in front of her. It caused pain to instantly pierce through her heart. Her body whirled around furiously as she cried out in a teary voice, “Master, I beg you, please save him… He’s Lin’er… He is my younger brother Lin’er… please save him, please!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Xia Qingyue stared dumbfoundedly at the weeping wood spirit girl. She was begging for Yun Che’s life with nearly the exact same vigor that she did previously.</span></p>

Thus, robbing a wood spirit of their Wood Spirit Orb was the most heinous of crimes, and it would also make that person the wood spirit race’s mortal enemy.</span></p>

Moreover, for a perfect Royal Wood Spirit Orb to appear within a human’s body, the only possibility was that this Royal Wood Spirit had entrusted it to that person wholeheartedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the purest living beings in the world, woods spirits had an innate ability to sense good and evil. As a royal wood spirit, to be willing to sacrifice his own life and pass his own Wood Spirit Orb to a human, it would mean that he either owed him a huge debt of gratitude that could never be repaid, or it meant that this human was someone whom he was willing to leave everything to.</span></p>

Her greatest desire, and what one could even describe as the greatest motivation for her to continue living on, was to find her younger brother He Lin… It was just as He Lin himself had most desired to find her as well, because that was her closest family and also the last hope of the wood spirit royal family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But today, He Lin’s Wood Spirit Orb had appeared in the body of a human, which meant that He Lin was dead.</span></p>

He was like that final straw… or perhaps he could be considered the final consolation.</span></p>

But fortunately for her, Shen Xi saved her life and brought her to this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She served Shen Xi at her side, and her only request was to beg Shen Xi to help her find He Lin.</span></p>

All those years ago, when I brought you back, I had already promised that I’d help you find your royal brother. Since I have promised you this, I will naturally not go back on my word. Ling’er, please get up… I will save him.”</span></p>

Even though she had only accompanied Shen Xi for three short years, she was deeply aware of what those words meant to her… This kind of heavenly favor was a debt of gratitude that would be hard for her to repay even if she had all eternity to do so.</span></p>

She grabbed his spasming hands, and consoled him in a teary voice, “Did you hear that, Master said that she was willing to save you. You’ll be fine in no time at all… you’ll get better very soon…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” It was as if a huge boulder had been lifted off her shoulders, but just as Xia Qingyue’s heart was about to rejoice, she suddenly felt a deep exhaustion assault her. She glanced at He Ling and made a small bow to the empty space in front of her, “The great favor that Senior Shen Xi has shown today, Xia Qingyue will never ever forget it.”</span></p>

Since he also has a Royal Wood Spirit Orb, it will not stain this place either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue faintly shook her head, “Senior is willing to save him and that is the favor of heaven in and of itself. Once the Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark afflicting him has been lifted, whatever Senior desires me to do, Xia Qingyue… will… definitely… obey.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A divine sense lightly swept over Xia QIngyue’s body and it seemed that the celestial figure within the mist was only now truly taking a measure of her, “What an obstinate and stubborn girl, have you always been this way?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue, “...”</span></p>

During those fifty years, he needs to remain in this place and he cannot take a single step out of it. Furthermore, I will need to seal his memories, so for the fifty years that he is here, he will not remember anything of his past, and once he leaves fifty years later, he will also not remember anything that has happened in this place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is fine, I thank Senior for fulfilling my wish,” Xia Qingyue did not find the words that rang in her ears the least bit surprising, “This junior will entrust this matter to someone to pick him up from this place once fifty years have gone by.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” The celestial voice expressed a bit of surprise, “Why won’t you be the one to receive him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Xia Qingyue did not respond, instead she deftly changed the subject by asking, “Can I ask Senior Shen Xi, during these fifty years, before the Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark on his body is completely expunged, is there any way to lessen his pain?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry,” the voice very quickly became incomparably gentle as she replied her, “even though I am unable to get rid of the Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark in a short amount of time, I can make it so that his curse gradually does not flare up. And even if it does flare up, it will not be to the point where it is unbearable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the celestial voice rang in her ears, a white light that was so pure that it was inconceivable floated down from the mists and shrouded Yun Che’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the white light neared her body, Xia Qingyue’s beautiful eyes immediately focused… She felt as if her body, blood, profound veins, and soul… had all been gently cleaned by exceedingly pure spring water. The pain from the wounds that Yun Che had gouged on her body lessened and the pain and panic in her heart were also softly being eased, even her five sense had become exceptionally clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So this was the… “power” that foster father spoke of?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white light softly engulfed Yun Che’s body and his contortions and spasms immediately grew much less tortured. The distortion of his muscles and blood vessels, and his hoarse screaming, lessened as time went by. It was as if his entire body had been fished out of a blood pond from hell, and bathed in a warm spring, as every cell and every pore of his body was being soothed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few motes of clarity appeared in those disordered eyes at this time and he slowly raised a trembling hand… He had, astonishingly enough, recovered some control over his body. He also managed to gasp out two words rather clearly, “Qing…yue…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alleviating his pain was in the end a help, but it was not a cure. Yun Che still felt unbearable pain run through his entire body, but it had been lowered to the point where his will was able to forcible withstand it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that the greatest worry in her heart had dissipated, Xia Qingyue once again made a deep bow towards the empty space in front of her. After that, she spoke to Yun Che softly, “It’s simply too great… Senior Shen Xi has already promised to save you, so you don’t need to suffer from so much pain anymore. It’s already… no longer a problem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even though fifty years are very long, remaining in this place at Senior Shen Xi’s side means that no one will be able to hurt you again. If you are able to gain Senior Shen Xi’s admiration or fondness, it will also be… an extremely big opportunity for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then during these fifty years, you can stay here without any reservations and forget about everything in the outside world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark afflicting him, Yun Che would no longer be able to enter the Eternal Heaven Pearl. This meant that he had lost the extremely large opportunity to cultivate for three thousand years in the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm. But, given that he had been targeted by Qianye Ying’er, there was already no safe space for Yun Che to rest his head in this world. Staying in this place would undoubtedly guarantee fifty years of absolute safety for Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because even Qianye Ying’er would not dare to force her way into this forbidden ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since I have promised that he could stay, then there is nothing for you to worry about,” Shen Xi’s voice rang out slowly yet again, “You possess the Heart of Glazed Glass, and you are a woman who has received the protection of heaven. Since I am allowing him to stay, why don’t you stay as well and accompany him during these fifty years?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Shen Xi, this was also another exception that she was making… because Xia Qingyue possessed the Heart of Glazed Glass that was rare for her to see even over the hundreds of thousands of years that she had lived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After lowering Yun Che gently to the ground, Xia Qingyue slowly stood up and said, “I thank Senior Shen Xi for your good intentions. Since he is staying with Senior in this place, Qingyue really does not need to worry about him at all anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qingyue has already disturbed Senior for quite a while, so it is time for me to leave and go to the place that I must return to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Shen Xi expressed quite some astonishment at this reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She took one last long and deep look at Yun Che before closing her eyes and turning around, and she steeled herself with determined resoluteness as she prepared to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, the edge of her skirt was firmly grabbed by a trembling hand. Yun Che’s entire body shuddered and his face started to contort once again, but the hand that was grabbing the hem of Xia Qingyue’s skirt was holding on very tightly, “Qingyue… where… are… you going…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his pain had lessened by a great degree, he had also regained a bit of clarity and conscious thought. Where else would Xia Qingyue go… but the Moon God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But after what had happened at the wedding celebration in the Moon God Realm, she had already become a sinner in the eyes of the entire Moon God Realm. Even if the Moon God Emperor was truly as she had said, and treated her like his very own daughter, and would forgive her even if she had made a worse mistake… besides him, there would still be the wrath of the entire Moon God Realm waiting for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, no one would be able to bring themselves to believe that the wrath of the Moon God Emperor had actually completely subsided… So the Moon God Realm would likely imprison her, exile her, cripple her profound strength… or maybe even execute her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Xia Qingyue’s footsteps halted but she did not turn back, “Don’t worry, I’ll be fine… This is something that I need to face.”</span></p>
