 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire area was filled with meteoroids and space dust. The dispersing Purple Pylon divine power and Yun Che’s elemental energy gleamed with brilliant light as they devoured everything that approached them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che stood proud and tall within a field of meteorites. The wound on his chest was horrific and sinister-looking, but he seemed to pay it no mind. His gloomy eyes were fixed on the red figure in the distance. Her aura was extremely weak and frail, causing his lips to curl into a cold and cruel smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er’s wounds were heavy but none of them were life-threatening. Her body blurred as she arrived at Yun Che’s side. Her eyes were pointed in the same direction as Yun Che as she said in a cool and indifferent voice, “To think that you would actually burn your own life force to open up this Purple Pylon Divine Domain. Your desire to kill both Yun Che and I is so strong that it’s rather puzzling. In fact, I don’t quite know whether to praise you for your ruthlessness or mock you for your stupidity!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue slowly rose to her feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Drip...</span></p>

They slowly but inexorably dripped from her lips as each dot dyed her red robes an even deeper shade of scarlet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Moon God Emperor, there was nearly no power in this world that could truly push her into a desperate situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che had sworn to kill her himself but he knew all too well that it was utter foolishness to believe that he could kill a Xia Qingyue whose power had already surpassed Yue Wuya with just him and Qianye Ying’er alone. They would definitely be forced to use a trump card, no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now though, it seemed that there was no need for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Purple Pylon Divine Domain was incomparably strong and when they hadn’t been able to break it, it was strong enough to cause them to despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its strength truly had exceeded the limits of the current universe. But she had to pay an enormous price just to use it, even though she already possessed the Nine Profound Exquisite Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had to burn her own life force to use it so the nature of her domain was actually quite similar to the most terrible of the Heretic God’s divine powers—Other Shore Asura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, if this divine domain which was connected to her life, which she had to sacrifice her own life to use, was forcefully ripped apart, the backlash would far exceed the backlash of the cruelest domains in the current universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her vitality and her body had sustained heavy damage and her profound energy was swiftly dissipating. It was as if she was unable to gather any of it. This was supposed to be a long and drawn-out battle, a bitter and vicious struggle to the end, but it had been brought to a swift close because she had opened the Purple Pylon Divine Domain… In her current state, she was nothing more than a lamb waiting to be slaughtered by Yun Che and Qianye Ying’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had already calculated that the odds of this happening were very high due to Yun Che’s presence. However, she still had not hesitated to use it… Because this was her final gamble and it was the only gamble she could make.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her purple hair fell to her shoulders messily as it&nbsp;instantly turned as black as ink, providing a sharp contrast to her increasingly pale face. She stared at Yun Che and Qianye Ying’er as she softly whispered to herself, “In the end, I still… wasn’t able to… accomplish anything…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, you did well! You did very well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che slowly advanced and compared to Xia Qingyue’s soft and fevered whisper, his voice was cuttingly cold. “You very… very successfully forced me to become a monster!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He slowly raised the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor Sword. He pointed it at the distant Xia Qingyue, the tip of his sword flashing with a gloomy black light. “And now, it is time for you… to pay back your debts!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Drip...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet another drop of blood gently fell from her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For some odd reason, Yun Che felt a wrenching pain in his heart as he gazed at those hazy eyes filled with pain. It was as if countless needles were deeply stabbing into his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the cruel image of the Blue Pole Star disintegrating under that purple light immediately flashed into his mind, wracking his heart with a different pain that was just as intense. He gritted his teeth as hatred and killing intent violently surged into his sword… However, even as he tightly clenched his teeth together in rage, he found that he was unable to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Given Xia Qingyue’s frail and utterly messed up aura, he could kill her in more ways than he could count.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His father, his mother, Wuxin, Yuechan, Lingxi, Caiyi, Xue’er, Yuanba...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These faces slowly floated up in his mind. His hands were gently trembling. In fact, even now, he still found it quite hard to accept that Xia Qingyue had actually been able to so ruthlessly deal that vicious blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the Blue Pole Star had been surrounded by god emperors, even though its fate had already been sealed, she still shouldn’t have personally...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could she bear to personally...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But her expression suddenly changed after she finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A curtain of light abruptly spread open in front of them and a small and beautiful palace appeared within that curtain of light, a strange white glow the color of moonlight radiating from it… In the next instant, a wild storm instantly appeared around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, Xia Qingyue’s figure had disappeared into a distant star region.</span></p>

A black light suddenly flashed through his eyes as he thrust his arm forward.

Soon, a cosmic hurricane that could destroy moons and shatter stars started to form.</span></p>

However, once the news had been confirmed, a cold and cutting sensation began to spread through her body, a sensation that the god emperor who reigned supreme over ice and snow was not even supposed to be able to feel.</span></p>
