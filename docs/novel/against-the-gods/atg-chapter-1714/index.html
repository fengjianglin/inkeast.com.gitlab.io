 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eastern Divine Region, Eternal Heaven God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Xuzi and Honorable Tai Yu were sitting across from one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Xuzi’s eyes were closed and his expression was calm. But Honorable Tai Yu’s face was dark, and simmering anger could be seen in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What exactly is the Northern Divine Region trying to do!?” Honorable Tai Yu said in a somber voice. “The Great Void Cauldron had fallen in Yun Che’s hands back in the God Realm of Absolute Beginning! It is very likely that they destroyed those three star realms themselves before framing our Eternal Heaven!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So they mean to…” Zhou Xuzi spoke in a low voice. He was calculating the various possibilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They wanted to use the Great Void Cauldron to frame the Eternal Heaven God Realm, and they were even willing to destroy three of their own star realms to accomplish it. Was it to destroy the Eternal Heaven’s reputation?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this had happened in the Western or Southern Divine Region, it would certainly be the case. If they were “discovered” to have destroyed a vast star realm because of their own personal grudges, it would definitely arouse the anger of the God Realm against them and harm the Eternal Heaven’s prestige and reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it had happened in the Northern Divine Region! Even if the Eternal Heaven God Realm had acted a thousand times more viciously, it still would not be seen as a crime. On the contrary, it would be seen as a shining achievement that would be admired through the ages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ai.” Zhou Xuzi let out a soft sigh. His old eyes stretched open as he said slowly, “I was as cautious and prudent as I could be while preparing for that trip into the Northern Region. However, I never imagined that I not only fell into the foul trap of Yun Che and the Devil Queen, but our entire exchange was also being recorded in secret. It looks like I’ve become more useless with age.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how high the grade of a Profound Imagery Stone, it would still send out profound energy vibrations while it was recording images.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stronger a person was, the easier it was to conceal these profound energy vibrations. But Zhou Xuzi was not just any old person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time his image had ever been recorded without him noticing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point in time, a person from the Northern Divine Region flashed into his mind… It was a Witch from the Soul Stealing Realm, the one whose ability to hide and disguise herself was said to be transcendent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seventh Witch Hua Jin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was rumored that no one would be able to detect her existence once she hid herself in the darkness. In fact, her ability to conceal herself was so strong that it could be compared to any of the Heavenly Slaughter Star Gods who had reached the peak of their powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Honorable Tai Yu replied, “We were in the Northern Divine Region after all. The darkness energy that pervades that region will interfere with our spiritual senses, and they definitely came fully prepared. It isn’t strange that my lord did not detect it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m worried… that they may have recorded far more than this.” The Eternal Heaven God Emperor’s expression grew solemn. “Qingchen has already passed on, but the thing I’m most afraid of is that his transformation into a devil will be revealed to the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My lord, rumors are flying wildly in the Eastern Divine Region right now. How should we deal with them?” Tai Yu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Xuzi shook his head. “There’s no need to pay any attention to them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because there was no use trying to explain themselves. In fact, there was no way they could even prove their innocence. It was a fact that he had brought Zhou Qingchen into the Northern Divine Region, that he had made a furious vow when he left. It was also undeniable that the Great Void Cauldron had been involved in this incident. It was extremely hard to deny their involvement… because no one would believe that the Eternal Heaven God Realm’s Great Void Cauldron would actually fall into Yun Che’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He slowly got to his feet, his broad white robes suddenly flaring up. His god emperor might suddenly erupted from his body as he stood in the center of this sacred hall. “On the contrary, I am actually extremely anxious to find out what they are trying to do right now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If… Yun Che is going to force a meeting by threatening us with compromising images of Qingchen, it could not go any better!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one in the Eastern Divine Region had even considered the possibility of the Northern Divine Region crossing the border to attack them so the god emperors, who had the best understanding of the state and overall strength of the Northern Divine Region, would never think of it either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While they were helpless to deal with the devils when they were holed up in the Northern Region, they would simply be digging their own graves if they tried to force their way out of those dark lands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of this, even when they were faced with these meticulously constructed false charges, false charges they could not poke a hole in, the Eternal Heaven God Realm’s reaction was exceptionally calm and composed. In fact, they even found these trumped up charges rather ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no one in the Eternal Heaven God Realm, including Zhou Xuzi himself would imagine that this pile of shit that had been dumped on their heads would plunge their realm into a terrible nightmare in the near future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ————</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Western Divine Region, Dragon God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon God Realm was incredibly vast. It was not only the strongest king realm in existence, but also the largest star realm in the entire God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every year, countless profound practitioners would make a pilgrimage to this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The aura in the Dragon God Realm was exceptionally primal and dense, it was somewhat similar to the aura of the God Realm of Absolute Beginning. In the heart of the Dragon God Realm, the holy land known as the “Dragon God Region”, the aura was at its thickest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless profound practitioners would come from very distant lands to visit the Dragon God Realm and peer at the vast Dragon God Region from a distance. It was not that they did not want to approach this holy land, but that the might coming from the Dragon God Region was simply far too dreadful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They did not even dare come within five hundred kilometers of these sacred grounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dreadful might that belonged solely to the Dragon God Region was known as draconic aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Nine Dragon Gods, forty-three Dragon Sovereigns, three hundred and eight Master Dragons dwelled there along with the supreme and unmatched Dragon Monarch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Dragon God Realm… The most exalted existence in the four divine regions, in the entire Primal Chaos Dimension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A realm that was unrivaled, an existence that could not be shaken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most important reason for the strength of the king realms was the indestructible legacy of divine power that they passed down through the generations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the Dragon God Realm was not the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They relied solely on the strength passed down from one’s bloodline!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They possessed their draconic bodies which stood at the peak of creation. They had extremely long lifespans, and a trace amount of divine blood that they had inherited from the primordial dragon gods still flowed in their veins. Thus, even though they did not possess an indestructible inheritance of divine power, the dragons were still a supreme race that could crush all the other races, all the other king realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dragon stood supreme among all living creatures, this was a fact undisputed since time immemorial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The draconic aura in the center of the Dragon God Region was so dense and thick that it could easily shatter the mind of any other living creature. If a person did not possess a sufficiently strong cultivation or spirit, they would not even be able to crawl through this place, much less walk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a large, tall man descended from the sky and slowly began to make his way to the great hall in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was over two meters tall and he had a head of long bluish-gray hair.

His face was extraordinarily handsome but it also instilled fear in the hearts of anyone who gazed upon it. This was especially true when it came to this man’s eyes.

Why would the Eternal Heaven God Emperor, someone who abhors the darkness, secretly venture into the Northern Divine Region with his son. Could it be that the rumors were true and that his son was truly transformed into a devil a few years ago?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Monarch glanced at him before speaking. “You didn’t cut your expedition in the God Realm of Absolute Beginning short and rush back home just because of trivial things that don’t concern our realm, correct?”</span></p>

Energy waves rippled out, causing the vision of the Dragon Guards, who were stationed far away from the great hall, to go blurry. Their bodies violently swayed as they very nearly fell unconscious.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Monarch lost his composure for only that moment. In the next instant, his aura went back to normal and he calmly spoke, “That’s impossible. My Dragon Queen has been secluding herself within the Forbidden Land of Samsara for the past few years, and she needs to remain in seclusion for at least a thousand years… Perhaps even ten thousand years. How could her aura appear in the God Realm of Absolute Beginning?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The barrier broke and a clump of grayish-white dirt appeared on top of his palm. Anyone who had been to the God Realm of Absolute Beginning would be able to easily tell that this was ancient dirt from that place. Every grain of sand vibrated with its unique primordial aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there were a few traces of light profound energy… that was clearly mixed in with this primordial aura!</span></p>
