 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er was enshrouded in incomparably dense profound light. The aura of her profound energy was extremely pure and clean but it had also formed an exceptionally violent vortex around her. A vortex of energy which engulfed the space five kilometers around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che sensed the changes in Qianye Ying’er’s aura. She had refined nearly half of the second Untamed World Pellet. This was going much faster than it had the last time, when she had taken a full half a year to refine the first pellet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this speed was something that Yun Che had already predicted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within half a month’s time, Qianye Ying’er would successfully refine the second Untamed World Pellet. Once that happened, she would undoubtedly become his greatest strength. Even if he counted the Yama Ancestors and the Yama Devils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not disturb Qianye Ying’er. Instead, Yun Che held He Ling’s hand as he brought her to another area of the Primordial Profound Ark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The world within the Primordial Profound Ark was sparse and barren. It was very rare to see plants and flowers, and the occasional profound beast that appeared would always be a low-grade one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order to reduce the Primordial Profound Ark’s energy consumption, Yun Che had never tried to create a more fertile environment. Instead, he had just been maintaining it in a state where it would not collapse. He was naturally saving the rest of the energy for dimensional jumps in case they were caught in a bad situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He Ling,” Yun Che gently said as he looked straight ahead, “you must think that I’ve become very frightening now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” He Ling’s lips parted slightly but she was lost in her own thoughts, so she did not reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I used to respect every life. Use to value the destiny of every living person. But right now, I only view them as one of two things. They are either useful tools or useless trash.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even when I faced off against my hated enemies in the past, I never killed them in a cruel manner or tortured them to death. Neither did I allow myself to lose my humanity when I fought my foes. But today, I can torture the Three Yama Ancestors in the cruelest of ways without even blinking an eye. Three people who I didn't even have a single grievance against. I tortured them in ways that made them long for death for six straight days, but there wasn’t a single trace of reluctance in my heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I once viewed saving the God Realm and the universe as a duty that I had to fulfill. And I had hoped that it would become the glory of my household, something that would protect us forever. But now, I thirst to see the God Realm wailing in pain and despair.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yet I don’t even feel the least bit frightened by what I’ve become, and perhaps that’s the most frightening thing of all.” Yun Che slowly closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His talent was singular and he had an immeasurable future, one that was bound to break through all the limits of the current era. Yet he was missing one crucial component. He lacked the ambition to go with his talent, something that he sorely needed… Shen Xi had said the same thing to him years ago, and so had Xia Qingyue. Even the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor had said those words to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He understood what they were trying to tell him, but a person’s desires and aspirations were not so easily changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, if the Eternal Heaven God Emperor had not gone back on his word after the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor left and the three divine regions had not acted against him out of fear, then it would have been a “happily-ever-after” for everyone involved. Yun Che would have returned to the Blue Pole Star with Jasmine and even if he did return to the God Realm, it would only be to visit the Snow Song Realm or Shen Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if Yun Che truly did break through the limits of this current age and surpassed the Evil Infant, the worries of all the powerhouses in the God Realm would never have come to pass… Because that was Yun Che’s true nature, his greatest wish and desire, and it would never have changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, their fear toward the Evil Infant and Yun Che’s future growth caused them to bare their cruel fangs at the messiah who had just fulfilled his “duty”...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had never in their wildest dreams imagined that when Yun Che was forced to pursue strength, he would become such a dreadful monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master,” He Ling said as she looked at him. Her green pupils trembled and her gentle voice was as light and airy as the wind. “This isn’t your fault. None of it is. Even if you end up destroying the three divine regions in the future, you are merely withdrawing the mercy you had shown to them previously.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps no one would believe that these words would come out from the mouth of a wood spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che suddenly turned to look at her. He smiled as he gazed upon He Ling’s beautiful face. Her expression was slightly dazed as he whispered to her, “Actually, you don’t need to worry about me. Because you, Hong’er, and You’er still exist in my world, I will never abandon the last vestiges of my humanity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” His words had plucked at the flustered strings of her heart. He Ling’s lips parted slightly as an ethereal mist descended upon those beautiful emerald eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Ling had borne witness to the changes that had occured within Yun Che over the last few years. The current him oozed a terrifyingly dark and oppressive might. To the point where even people like Yan Tianxiao would tread very carefully around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only when he was speaking to Hong’er, You’er, or her that he was still as gentle as she remembered… Perhaps, this was the only bit of gentleness and warmth that still remained within him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes and the smile that Yun Che showed her were not dark or gloomy at all. In fact, they did not even contain a hint of coldness. “Let’s dual cultivate. Your pure wood spirit aura will definitely help with my comprehension of the Law of Nothingness. At the same time, it will also aid the growth of your spiritual strength. In fact, it might help the Sky Poison Pearl recover its poison power quicker.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” He Ling looked down, flustered, she did not dare to meet his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It will speed up the process of our revenge. However, you will never become a tool to me, you will always be a part of my life. This was set the moment our lives were connected, and it will never change, not until the day we die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gentle ripples spread throughout her heart without ceasing and it soundlessly carried away all of her worries, fears, and misgivings. She raised her delicate head and looked straight into Yun Che’s eyes, her beautiful eyes shining brightly, as if all the stars in the universe were gathered in them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She really liked it when Yun Che said these sort of words to her. It was a joy… that could not be described with words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che suddenly stretched out an arm and sacred white light seemed to intermingle with viridian light as it shone from his fingers.

Furthermore, her beauty was different from all the other women Yun Che had been with. She was beautiful in a gentle and fragile manner, just like the first bloom of spring, like the newly-formed wings of a butterfly which had just crawled out of its cocoon.</span></p>
