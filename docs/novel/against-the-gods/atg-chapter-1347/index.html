When the Evil Infant Wheel of Myriad Tribulations flew back into Jasmine’s hands, Tumi’s head had also dropped to the ground and it rolled a very far distance on the ground of the Star God Realm that had been stained black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes were still roundly staring, his bulging eyeballs and dilated pupils were proof of just how much despair and terror he had felt right before he died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the imperial tutor and sage of the Star God Realm, he had never imagined that this would be his fate. He had used so much effort to scheme and plot and perfectly control everything from start to finish, but what he had obtained was not the success of the “ceremony” and the brilliant glory of the Star God Realm. Instead he had birthed a dreadful devil god… a devil god that would very likely destroy the Star God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the very end of his life, he did not know if he felt more discontent, fear, or regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tumi had been someone who had influenced the Star God Emperor for his entire life, he had been his teacher in the profound way, his teacher in the ways of society, and he had also been the person who had guided and helped Xing Juekong to become the Star God Emperor even though he was the Heavenly Chief Star God. After becoming the Star God Emperor, he still continued to treat Tumi with extreme respect and he was fine with being viewed on equal footing with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So one could say that seeing Tumi die a miserable death in front of him had dealt an extremely huge blow to the Star God Emperor. His entire body trembled as he pointed his sword towards Jasmine, “Jasmine, you… you clearly still possess your awareness… Could it be that you truly want… to destroy the Star God Realm!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Riiipp!!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">CLANG!!</span></p>

Both of the Star God Emperor’s eyes were completely bloodshot and his body flickered as he blinked forward, his sword piercing towards the devil wheel. Twelve points of starlight flew out of the sword as it surrounded the devil wheel and formed a destructive star formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">CRASH————</span></p>

Explosively flashing starlight completely blocked out the sun and the skies the next instant, practically dispelling all of the darkness enshrouding the Star God Realm, making it hard for even all the Star God elders to open their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black light that radiated from the Evil Infant Wheel of Myriad Tribulations was completely dispersed as it was sent flying downwards. In the blue skies above, the devilish infant’s face within the black clouds immediately contorted as it let out a wail that was several times more shrill and mournful than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the might of a god emperor, the highest level of power in this current world!&nbsp;</span></p>

The Moon God Emperor could not help but crow excitedly, “Great! It looks like the Evil Infant isn’t invincible after all!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Due to the influence of the aura within the Primal Chaos, the Heavenly Profound Treasures in this current era simply cannot be compared to what they were during the Era of Gods, my Eternal Heaven Realm’s Eternal Heaven Pearl is the same,” the Eternal Heaven God Emperor said slowly. “Furthermore, according to what the Eternal Heaven divine spirit said, when the Evil Infant Wheel of Myriad Tribulations destroyed all of the gods and devils all those years ago, it had completely exhausted all of its power. Only a short million years have passed since then. This coupled with the fact of the Primal Chaos aura growing muddy and turbid means that even though the Evil Infant may have awakened, it definitely would not have been able to recover too much of its power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eternal Heaven God Emperor’s words, coupled with the fact that Evil Infant Wheel of Myriad Tribulations’ devilish light had been scattered by the Star God Emperor, caused the dark gloom in the hearts of the three god emperors to be immediately dispelled. But in the very next instant, their expressions once again changed due to shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst the starlight which had broken and destroyed the darkness, Jasmine’s figure blurred as she once again snatched up the Evil Infant Wheel of Myriad Tribulations. A pair of long and narrow black devilish eyes shockingly opened up on the pitch-black wheel. In a single instant, the black light that had been extinguished for a short moment once more flared to life with a fierce intensity. It rebounded to swallow all of the starlight that had been emitted by the Star God Emperor, and in the blink of an eye it covered the heavens and blocked out the sun once more, as it devoured all of the light in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a moment, the entire Star God City was left completely lightless. It returned to complete darkness and one would not even be able to see their fingers if they stretched their hand out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The darkness had devoured the light, sealing away one’s sight and even completely cutting off their spiritual perception. The Twelve Heavenly Star Formation was finally formed while everyone was panicking, but they had immediately lost all contact with the other Star Gods within the darkness. So just as the Twelve Heavenly Star Formation was formed, it was immediately dispersed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The previously linked auras were cut off from each other and the auras of the six Star Gods, all of whom had already sustained very serious internal injuries, were thrown into utter chaos as even the spiritual senses of the Star Gods had been completely sealed by this darkness. Jasmine’s body had already flashed to the side of the six Star Gods by the time the Evil Infant Wheel of Myriad Tribulations in her hand let out a dark and gloomy devilish hiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOOM!!</span></p>

Amidst the trembling firelight, Jasmine held that devil wheel in her hand. Soon, her black eyes, eyes that released a black light that threatened to bury the world, eyes that contained a hatred that could fill the skies, were only a few feet away from them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The already skittish and panicked six Star Gods were all greatly startled. They were still, however, Star Gods, so even though their hearts were thrown into chaos by the shock, their power had already been released before their minds could react. Six great Star Gods and six different Star God powers attacked Jasmine in unison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The six Star Gods had released their powers simultaneously and in that instant, all sound had been extinguished. The entire world had descended into a dreadful silence for several instants. The only sound that remained was the wailing laughter of the Evil Infant image in the air, a sound that made one’s blood run cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because, after a million years of hibernation, its power had finally been awakened, it had finally been given new life!</span></p>

Moreover, her counterattack had arrived nearly instantaneously, as a pitch-black ring of energy fiercely exploded forth with her body at the center.</span></p>

Rather, it was as if their souls were being pulled into a black abyss as their vision, and the world of their hearts and souls grew pitch-black...</span></p>

It cruelly ruptured the flesh, bones, and internal organs across half of his body while also extinguishing the firelight that had reignited not too long ago.</span></p>

Jasmine’s pitch-black eyes were still firmly locked onto the six great Star Gods as she prepared to deliver them the finishing blow. But at this time, great roars shook the heaven as they surged up. The bodies of all thirty-six Star God elders shone with dazzling starlight as their feet formed a star formation which firmly surrounded Jasmine.</span></p>

His face was dreadfully dark and the sword in his hand once more glowed with the light of twelve stars. He completely disregarded his own worsening injuries and for the first time ever, the Heavenly Chief divine power was being crazily focused and accumulated without a care for the consequences.</span></p>

Her red hair had turned black and her blood-red eyes had turned black as well, while lines of pitch-black light wound around her snow-white skin. Yet nothing could cover up her extreme and flawless beauty. On the contrary, all of this had made her even more strangely beguiling and bewitching as several elements of danger and fear enhanced her appearance.</span></p>

With the devil domain at its center, countless black marks swiftly shot out as they filled the entire star formation. Before looks of terror and shock could even appear on the faces of the thirty-six elders, the vast star formation was torn to shreds as it was completely and utterly crushed...</span></p>

Even the sealing barrier that had connected and focused all of the power of the Star Gods, the Star God elders, and a countless amount of profound crystals had been torn apart by her, so the star formation that they had laid down with all of their might was no stronger than a thin piece of paper in front of Jasmine.</span></p>

Before the swiftly-formed star formation they had created had even done anything, it had been torn to pieces by Jasmine and the ensuing backlash that struck them again threw the profound auras of all thirty-six Star God elders into complete and utter chaos. Their blood and energy flowed in reverse but Jasmine had already generated a pitch-black scar of light as the bloodthirsty and ruthless demon wheel cruelly spun downwards.&nbsp;</span></p>

Jasmine did not turn around but a large pitch-black hand suddenly shot out from the darkness, grabbing up that Star God elder. A heart-rending and terrifying wail of misery rang in the air, but his struggles did not even last for a single breath before he was completely pulped and mashed by that hand of darkness.</span></p>

In the air above them, the Evil Infant Wheel of Myriad Tribulations carried a black light that could span the sky as it pressed down, as if it were a devil god that was opening a huge and abyssal mouth… A peal of terrified and shocked cries of misery rang out in the air as four Star God elders were completely swallowed up by the darkness. Once the darkness had faded away, they had already been transformed into four sets of completely rotted and withered skeletons.</span></p>
