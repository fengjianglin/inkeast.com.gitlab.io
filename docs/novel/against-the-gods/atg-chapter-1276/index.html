A wave of cold energy instantly suppressed his agitated aura, “Yun Che, calm down. That’s not necessarily her.”</span></p>

Furthermore, their status and level were separated by an uncountable distance.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon seeing her again, he should have felt a big burden lifted off his shoulders, he should have broken out into wild and rapturous joy. But why in the world was she the god empress that the Moon God Emperor was about to marry!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His aura had been suppressed by Mu Bingyun but Yun Che’s heart was still in complete chaos. He tried to get himself to calm down, but all of the blood in his body was rushing to his head at a crazy rate, and no matter what he did, he could not suppress it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Yun, you...”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Rulie, Yan Juehai, Mu Huanzhi, and the rest did not say a word, and the only thing that lingered in their hearts was a deep shock. Yun Che definitely was not the kind of person who lost control of his emotions easily. On the contrary, he was able to face the might of Honorable Qu Hui without changing expression, and he was even able to deliver a stern rebuke to him. No matter how serious his injuries were on the Conferred God Stage, he was as calm and composed as a demon. Even when he faced all the inducements of the realm kings, he could still reject each and every one of them with immeasurable calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet at this very moment, it seemed as if the spirit of this man was being seized by a demon. His entire body was shaking. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were unable to imagine what kind of provocation could cause Yun Che, who could even calmly reject realm kings, to lose control to such an extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not only limited to Yun Che either. It was clear that the aura of Mu Bingyun, who stood beside him, had also been thrown into disorder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this had happened after the Moon God Empress had shown herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They did not dare speculate or make any wild guesses, but there was at least one thing that was clear: This was definitely not a matter that outsiders could butt into or interfere with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yun Che, don’t be impulsive!” Mu Binyun said once again in a low voice, a voice that was laced with a profound powerlessness. The others had been astounded due to the god empress’ Heart of Glazed Glass, but she had been deeply shocked for a different reason, shocked to the point where she simply could not bring herself to believe that this was actually Xia Qingyue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She kept her hand firmly pressed against Yun Che’s arm, stopping him from making any fast moves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Moon God Realm, an incomparably exalted king realm, so who would dare cause any trouble here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Mu Bingyun knew that Yun Che definitely would dare…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was absolutely not because he was presumptuous and foolhardy, or a person who had no appreciation of the weight of things. It was because he had a pride and dignity that was carved into his bones!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could let anything go, he could face anything with a calm tranquility, but he would never ever let anyone cross the bottom line of his dignity. This was a point that Mu Bingyun had seen demonstrated very clearly from the first day that she brought him to the Snow Song Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he had first arrived in the Snow Song Realm, he mercilessly dealt a serious wound to the nephew of the hall master of Freezing Snow Hall, Mu Fengshu. When he was at the Heavenly Netherfrost Lake, he had not hesitated to go against Mu Xuanyin because of injustice. When he had reached the Profound God Convention, he had demonstrated this point to its extreme…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was something that was carved into his very bones, something that could not be changed for as long as he lived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Xia Qingyue was not just some close female friend, or just some lover who had promised her future to him. She was his officially wedded wife!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet she was going to become the Moon God Empress.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The humiliation of having your wife stolen from you was an enormous disgrace that any normal man would not be able to accept. In fact, one could even call it the greatest humiliation…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Let alone Yun Che!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Bingyun gave a silent sigh as her jade finger traced in the air, and after that, an Ice Phoenix aura engulfed Yun Che’s entire body. In a split second, it seemed as if someone had dumped cold water all over Yun Che. His entire body shuddered and his wild and disordered eyes finally regained some of their clarity.</span></p>

Someone who possessed that contained a little world within their profound veins, could break through realms and transcend the laws of the universe. It was publicly acknowledged as the best dual cultivation incubator in the universe. As one’s profound strength grew stronger, the existence of the Exquisite World would become harder and harder for people to detect, but it still could not escape the turbid and dreadful eyes of Gu Zhu.</span></p>

Could it be that all of these have been born from the coming calamity?”</span></p>

The Star Gods were so strong that they had more often than not died in their beds rather than in battle, but in the recent years, the Star God Realm had suffered one unfortunate incident after another. In the short span of a few decades, both the Heavenly Wolf Star God and the Heavenly Slaughter Star God had fallen one after the other. The good thing was that the Heavenly Slaughter had returned afterwards and the Heavenly Wolf had found a new successor… But after that, the Heavenly Poison Star God had been exterminated by a single knife stroke of the Heavenly Slaughter Star God.</span></p>

From very long ago, Jasmine had told him that Xia Qingyue possessed the “Heart of Glazed Glass”, so she had the protection of heaven. In the Snow Song Realm, Mu Xuanyin had also gave him a simple explanation regarding the “Heart of Glazed Glass”. Just based on the fragments of knowledge he had obtained from Jasmine and Mu Xuanyin, it was basically impossible for him to understand exactly what having a “Heart of Glazed Glass” entailed.</span></p>
