Puzzled, he frowned a little before asking, “Your Highness, that lightning tribulation… it’s not a secret really. To tell the truth, I have no idea what is going on here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? You don’t know?” the Brahma Heaven God Emperor narrowed his eyes slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che nodded. “When I was fighting against Luo Changsheng just now, I was grievously injured and barely conscious. I have no idea why I would suddenly achieve a breakthrough and trigger a lightning tribulation. To tell you the truth, my consciousness was already blurry by the time the lightning tribulation descended on me, and I have no idea what was going on at the time. When I finally awoke, I discovered that my wounds were healed, my profound energy and mental strength had been restored, and my cultivation level hadd ascended all the way to the middle stage of the Divine Spirit Realm. After that, the lightning tribulation went away completely… Even now, I have no idea what happened after I passed out. I was just about to check with all of you too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che asked in a surprised tone while frowning deeply, “I’ve never undergone a lightning tribulation before. I’ve only heard a little about it while I was under my master’s tutelage, but that lightning tribulation just now was largely different from what has been described to me by my master. I am young and inexperienced, so I’m not surprised by my lack of understanding of the matter. But… one of you has to know what’s going on, right? My seniors?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che casually threw the question right back into the god emperor’s laps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything he said just now could be summed up in one line: if even you god emperors have no idea what’s going on here, then how would a junior like me know anything about it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s words made the experts of the Eastern Divine Region frown. Some of them looked doubtful, but the majority wore thoughtful looks on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che wasn’t even thirty years old yet, so he definitely was as inexperienced as he claimed to be. Moreover, everyone here had borne witness to how he was crushed and driven to the brink of death by Luo Changsheng just now. If he really was hiding a great secret that could resist even the likes of heavenly tribulation lightning, then why had he failed to protect himself against Luo Changsheng’s Divine King powers?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first nine stage lightning tribulation to ever happen in the history of the God Realm, so of course Yun Che couldn’t have experienced this before. Therefore, Yun Che’s insistence that he knew nothing was… perfectly reasonable, especially now that they had time to think things through. Forget Yun Che, not even the god emperors could figure out how he stayed unharmed under the nine stage lightning tribulation, got healed to peak health, and even ascended all the way to the middle stage of the Divine Spirit Realm...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you… really have no idea at all?” the Brahma Heaven God Emperor stared straight into Yun Che’s eyes while asking in a calm tone. The ghost of a smile flitted across his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A god emperor’s stare was something a realm king would’ve found difficult to endure, much less a profound practitioner as young as Yun Che was. It was obvious that Yun Che was feeling the pressure judging from the fearful expression on his face, but he didn’t hesitate in the slightest when he said, “Yes, senior. I am young and foolish, I have no idea what happened even now. It’d be great if any of you can enlighten me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Xuanyin once warned him strictly not to ascend to the Divine Spirit Realm by himself. It was because she was certain that the lightning tribulation he attracted would be an extraordinary one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had never imagined that he would achieve a breakthrough all of a sudden while he was fighting against Luo Changsheng. He definitely hadn’t thought that he would attract an unprecedented nine stage lightning tribulation during his ascension...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back at the Golden Crow Lightning Flame Valley, when the Golden Crow’s Soul had gifted him the Heretic God’s Lightning Seed, it had told him that not even a heavenly tribulation lightning could harm his body. It was a fact. Not only did the nine stage lightning tribulation fail to do him harm, it even elevated both his cultivation and his Great Way of the Buddha. Unfortunately, this outcome also came with a huge side effect...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And that was a level of shock that no one was immune to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So after he mulled over his options again and again while he was struck by lightning, he decided that his best way out was to insist that he had absolutely no idea what was going on here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Qianye Ying’er’s lips curled slightly as she let out a soft hmph, but she chose not to say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, an old, excited voice rang, “Why Yun Che is unhurt despite being struck by tribulation lightning… I believe I may know the reason!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old voice instantly attracted everyone’s attention… it was none other than the head of the Heavenly Mystery Three Elders himself, Moyu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Mystery Three Elders rarely said anything because they spoke in the language of the heavens. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that their words carried weight beyond imagination. If the same line had come out of another person’s mouth, the god emperors might have chosen to ignore it completely. But since it was the word of Moyu, no one dared to underestimate or treat it carelessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you sure!?” the Eternal Heaven God Emperor exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che frowned slightly as his heart skipped a beat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Mystery Realm was just an upper star realm, but its status was equal to that of a king realm. This showed just how important it was in the Eastern Divine Region. Yun Che had heard some stories about the Heavenly Mystery Realm, and they almost sounded like myths to him...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It couldn’t be… Did they really know something?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moyu slowly nodded in response. The excitement on his face was so intense that it shocked even the god emperors themselves. In fact, Moyu wasn’t the only one who was looking excited. Mozhi and Mowen had the same expression as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Mystery Three Elders had spied on heavenly mysteries for their whole lives, and it was to the point where life and death didn’t weigh heavily on them. As a result, the secular world normally wouldn’t stir even a ripple in their hearts. Right now though, they looked so excited that it was almost as if they had witnessed a True God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Mystery Three Elders stared at Yun Che with shaky eyes. Slowly, Moyu began. “This boy… may very well be… a child of the heavens!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yun Che, “...?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?!” the Eternal Heaven God Emperor’s face turned stiff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Child… Child of the heavens?” They were such shocking words that left every profound practitioner flabbergasted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It makes sense, doesn’t it? Why would a child of the heavens be hurt by heavenly powers!?” Moyu continued, “The dark clouds that covered the world, the nine stage lightning tribulation; it was nothing like we have ever seen before! It was the heaven itself declaring the birth of a child of the heavens!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything he said sounded absolutely ridiculous, but since he was one of the Heavenly Mystery Three Elders, it gave his words a completely different meaning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahahaha!” Cang Shitian looked up and laughed loudly, “What utter nonsense. I’ve lived for tens of thousands of years, and I’ve never heard of a so-called ‘child of the heavens’. I can’t believe that someone like you would spout such hilarious nonsense.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eastern Divine Region might respect the Heavenly Mystery Realm deeply, but that didn’t mean the Southern Divine Region was the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve never heard of this ‘child of the heavens’ either,” Dragon Monarch said indifferently. “However, I’m also aware that the Heavenly Mystery Realm has never told lies. If you are willing, can you tell us what a ‘child of the heavens’ is? And why are you so sure that Yun Che is a ‘child of the heavens’?”</span></p>

Then, he began, “The words ‘child of the heavens’ has been a prophecy from our ancestor dating many years ago. It is also… the last heaven mystery my Great Ancestor, Haotian, deciphered before his passing.”</span></p>

The very first prediction he made was that Eternal Heaven would become a king realm one day.”</span></p>

Even his voice had grown a little gentler, “What is the meaning of the ‘child of the heavens’ mentioned by Great Ancestor Haotian in his final prophecy? Why are you all so certain that this ‘child of the heavens’ is none other than Yun Che?”</span></p>

It was as if they had been pushed into a fog of illusions. No one was more shocked than the god emperors, however. The Brahma Heaven God Emperor, Eternal Heaven God Emperor, Star God Emperor, and Moon God Emperor were frozen as if they had been struck by heavenly lightning—their bodies, their features, their eyes; everything had become frozen at once—even the Dragon Monarch had turned around suddenly, and God Emperor Shitian had jumped to his feet with wide eyes, his sleepy, sloppy posture completely gone in an instant.</span></p>

It was the profound way of humans who had broken through their limits and ascended into godhood… But truthfully, it was ultimately just the divine way of mortals. Although it was a way beyond mortal limitations, and a way that tried its very best to get as close to godhood as possible, it ultimately failed to extend into the realm of the gods.</span></p>

It was common knowledge or even the complete truth to humans, beasts, demons, and spirits; all of the races in which it was no longer possible to become true gods because the aura of Primal Chaos was growing murkier and murkier. These days, the words “True God” were just a distant myth.</span></p>

Is this really the ‘heavenly mysteries’ the Eastern Divine Region regard so highly? The Era of Gods has long since perished, and it is neither possible for a mortal to become a god, nor is it possible for a True God to be born into this world. This is something even a three year old knows.”</span></p>
