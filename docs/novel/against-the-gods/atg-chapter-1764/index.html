Luo Shangchen jerked his head up to stare at Luo Changsheng as he yelled, “Scram! Hurry up… and leave!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the eyes of the world, this was undoubtedly Luo Shangchen trying to protect Luo Changsheng from enduring any humiliation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the people from the Holy Eaves Realm understood the sorrow and rage in his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahahaha.” Yun Che let out a great laugh before he said, “It looks like your royal father doesn’t appreciate your kindness. But whether he appreciates it or not is his own business, because how could I bear to waste your show of filial piety?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you can’t replace him, then you can do it alongside him. After all, the two of you are ‘father and son’!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He put heavy emphasis on the words “father and son” and his smile was deeply mocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, everyone from the Holy Eaves Realm was struck by the sense that Yun Che knew the whole truth behind their “father and son” relationship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Luo Changsheng did not try to fight for any more favors. He simply gave Yun Che a respectful bow instead as he said, “Thank you for your kindness, Devil Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he quietly flashed over to Luo Shangchen’s side and got on his hands and knees beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Get… lost!” Luo Shangchen violently thrust out a hand toward Luo Changsheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng did not try to defend himself, but Chi Wuyao suddenly raised a hand. She sealed Luo Shangchen’s power away while speaking in a merry voice, “Holy Eaves Realm King, it’s rare for your son to make such a show of filial piety. He’s willing to share all glory and shame together with you. Rejecting him like this is quite unsightly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the Northern Divine Region, Chi Wuyao’s authority was second only to Yun Che’s. Even though a thousand waves were currently crashing about in Luo Shangchen’s heart, he still bit his lip and bore it… He had already suffered so much humiliation, so how could he risk the safety of his sect over a fit of pique?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He kept quiet and simply put his head down, resuming his crawl toward Yun Che once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the number one realm king of the Eastern Divine Region, he had thought of dying gloriously in battle. When the Devil Emperor returned to the world, he had even thought of blindly throwing his life away. However, he had never once imagined that he would actually be willing to endure such humiliation… Because Yun Che knew that this was far harder on him than death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So while Yun Che’s actions were superficially magnanimous, the intentions behind these actions were most cruel. This was the cruelest way he could take revenge on Luo Shangchen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But who exactly was to blame for his present plight? The two other great upper star realms in the Eastern Divine Region, the Glazed Light Realm and the Shrouding Sky Realm, had been left with their bodies and dignities intact. In fact, from now on, their status in the Eastern Divine Region would be far greater than ever before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there was something even more tragic and ironic than this. The main reason he had been the first person to stand up and condemn Yun Che to death, which was also the reason for humiliation today, had been because of Yun Che’s conflicts with Luo Changsheng and Luo Guxie, the two people he now hated the most in his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How ironic and ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng copied his actions as he crawled along behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When two people were being shamed at the same time, the sense of humiliation was subconsciously lessened by more than half. With every step and breath he took, he could clearly sense Luo Changsheng’s aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the events of the past few days had never happened, then this extremely humiliating experience might have become the most precious memory for him with Luo Changsheng’s willing participation. It would be something that he would never forget.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However… all of the cruelest things in the world seemed to be raining down on his head at the same time, making him feel like he was trapped in an unrelenting nightmare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao’s eyes hovered over Luo Changsheng for several breaths before she casually moved her gaze away from him. However, she did not bother to warn Yun Che either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because there was no need to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he finally crawled back to where Yun Che was sitting, Luo Shangchen kowtowed toward him and said, “I am aware that the crime I committed back then is unforgivable, so everyone in my Holy Eaves Realm will definitely carve the Devil Master’s kindness of sparing our lives into our hearts. Our loyalty will never waver.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when he finished swearing that vow of loyalty, he suddenly sensed profound energy erupt behind him. In the next instant, a fatal beam of cold light condensed in the air as it aimed toward Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Shangchen was caught completely off guard, so he was instantly blasted aside by the energy wave. The beam of cold light tore through space itself as it made a beeline for Yun Che’s throat… A pair of vicious eyes which resembled those of a starving wolf stared at him from behind that attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s long hair fluttered in the air, but his body had not moved a single inch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A muffled sound rang in the air as Luo Changsheng leaped forward and thrust a shortsword at the frozen Yun Che. But Yan One’s withered hand flashed out and grabbed the blade of the sword. No blood dripped down Yan One’s arm and Luo Changsheng felt as if all the mountains in the world were pressing down on his shortsword. He couldn’t budge it a single millimeter and the power contained within the sword had started to vanish like a receding tide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What a joke. If the Three Yama Ancestors were to allow even a hair on Yun Che’s head to be harmed in their presence, they wouldn’t be able to live it down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che slowly raised his head to look at Luo Changsheng, who was clenching his teeth in anger. There was some disappointment in his eyes as he said, “That’s it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Two’s ghost claw smashed into Luo Changsheng’s chest. He let out a dull grunt as the shortsword flew from his hand. He was instantly sent flying, but Yan Three’s body bizarrely appeared in the air above him as he stomped down on him with brutal force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM——</span></p>

Luo Changsheng, who had once been incomparably brilliant, had lost all of his dazzle in the presence of such luminaries.</span></p>

Even though he faced the Three Yama Ancestors, people who were powerful enough to suppress any god emperor, he showed no fear whatsoever. He let out a furious roar as he burned every bit of his blood essence to launch his ultimate attack. A storm that could even rend dimensions apart violently erupted from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The earth and space surrounding Luo Changsheng started to slowly disintegrate. A long trail of blood streamed behind him as he forcefully escaped from Yan Three’s suppression. However, he did not take this opportunity to flee. Instead, he drew another shortsword and started to crazily pour all of his energy into it.</span></p>

Blood streamed from all the orifices on his face as more than blood exploded from his body in more than a dozen places. He smashed into the ground like a falling boulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Changsheng!” At this moment, Luo Shangchen finally woke up from his reverie.

At first, the blood that flowed from his mouth had been bright red, but it had slowly begun to turn deep black, a color that matched the complexion of his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not try to regulate his energy and blood or beg for mercy. He raised his head proudly in the air and stared at the grand projection formation. As he faced all of the profound practitioners in the Eastern Divine Region, he roared in a hoarse voice, “You cowards… Why didn’t any… of you fight back…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your realm kings… are being humiliated by these devils like dogs… This is a disgrace that all of you bear… Why don’t you fight back, why do you actually feel at ease instead!?”</span></p>

SHUT UP!” Luo Shangchen roared in a trembling voice. He lunged forward and fell to his knees heavily in front of Yun Che. He spoke in a deeply terrified voice, “Devil Master, I did not teach my son well. Changsheng went through a huge setback recently and he’s lost his wits. For the great offense he committed just now, I… I will personally cripple his cultivation and lock him up in the Holy Eaves Realm for the rest of his life. I promise that he will never take half a step out of the Holy Eaves Sect until the day he dies.”</span></p>

In the blink of an eye, his forehead had turned bloody.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh… I don’t need you… to beg for my life!” Luo Changsheng yelled in a hoarse voice. “I, Luo Changsheng, would… rather die… than capitulate like you bunch… of spineless cowards!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aiyah.” Chi Wuyao sighed before a small smile appeared on her face. She muttered to herself, “He’s trying to use his own death to rouse the fires of rebellion within the hearts of everyone living in the Eastern Divine Region? That’s not a bad idea, but it’s too bad… that he’s still far too naive.”</span></p>

Even an old ghost like me suddenly feels moved to cry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng’s eyes bulged as he slowly fell to the ground.</span></p>

Just as he was about to crush his body to pieces, Chi Wuyao’s devilish figure suddenly flashed to Luo Changsheng’s side. A single palm blasted Yama Two aside as she scooped up Luo Changsheng, her devil soul directly invading his collapsing soul.</span></p>

He was using all of his remaining strength to stretch it out toward Luo Shangchen as he whispered in a voice that was as soft and weak as the chirping of an ant, “Royal father… I’ll… be going on ahead…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Luo Shangchen’s entire body shuddered and he found it hard to speak as he stifled his sobs.</span></p>
