Following behind him were the three sect masters who once ruled the Flame God Realm before pushing Huo Poyun to become the Flame God Realm King, the Vermillion Bird Sect Master Yan Wancang, the Phoenix Sect Master Yan Juehai, and the Golden Crow Sect Master Huo Rulie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The arrival of the four strongest profound practitioners of the Flame God Realm brought a wave of violent heat to the snow region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Huanzhi had been waiting for them, and the moment they arrived he immediately walked up to them and swept a glance at their faces. Then, he asked a question everyone knew the answer to, “Welcome, Flame God Realm King, sect masters. Why have you come to the Snow Song Realm today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one answered his question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Poyun was staring forward with calm eyes, his face devoid of any expression. The three Flame God Realm sect masters wore complicated expressions on their faces, and Huo Rulie stepped forward to speak to Huo Poyun in a low tone, “Poyun, listen to me, this is the last time I’m—”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Save it. I’ve already made up my mind!” Huo Poyun cut him off curtly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Huo Rulie nearly crushed his own teeth right there and then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Rulie was a fierce and stubborn man. Once he made up his mind on something, he would never back down. It was a trait every man and woman in the Flame God Realm and the Snow Song Realm were aware of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Poyun wasn’t as fierce as Huo Rulie was, but he definitely outdid his master in the stubbornness department.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Huanzhi frowned a little before saying, “I’ll inform the sect master right away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No need,” Huo Poyun said seriously while looking up a little. “Here is fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The snow suddenly stopped, and an invisible, soundless pressure pressed down from above. The three sect masters lost their breath as their vision darkened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A pitch-black figure slowly appeared before Huo Poyun’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one knew when he appeared in the sky. His eyes were as black as the night, as his gaze was devoid of any affectionate emotions such as longing or friendliness. There was only coldness and indifference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His face looked the same as ever, but his gaze and aura had changed completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All three Flame God Realm sect masters shrank into themselves unconsciously. Even Huo Rulie, the sect master closest to Yun Che, the one who laughed all day and called him “little brother Yun” had withdrawn his fiery aura almost instinctively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yun Che in the projection was scary enough, but it was far, far worse to meet him in person. It went beyond simple humility and felt more like their throats were being clutched by a devil. All it took was one thought, and he could and would kill them no matter the kind of relationship they shared in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Poyun was the only one looking up at Yun Che and smiling a little. “Long time no see, Yun Che. You look much better than I expected.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, the Witch Chanyi had just arrived. She frowned immediately when she heard his greeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was incredibly rude for a mere higher realm king to address Yun Che so directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was about to step out and teach the man a lesson when Chi Wuyao held an arm in front of her and stopped her. After that, she turned her neck and looked at a patch of snow on the other side of the meeting. There, Mu Feixue was standing and watching everything in silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Huanzhi wisely took his leave from the meeting he had no part in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without changing his posture or behavior in the slightest, Yun Che said, “I’m glad you showed up yourself and saved me some time, Flame God Realm King. As a reward, I promise to make your death swift.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“De… Devil Master!” Huo Rulie hurriedly rushed forward and said, “We have come to apologize to you. Poyun wasn’t trying to disobey you on purpose, he was just on the verge of a breakthrough and couldn’t leave his secluded cultivation in time to meet you. I beg you to recall your friendship and give Poyun… the Flame God Realm a chance to vow their loyalty and devotion to you.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was hoping to address Yun Che as “little brother Yun” and shorten the gap that had appeared between them, but he quickly discovered that he lacked the courage to say it when he was actually facing the man himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Friendship?” Yun Che said indifferently, “Whatever friendship the Flame God Realm King and I shared in the past has been completely buried by his own actions. So pray tell, what friendship are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Huo Rulie’s entire body tensed as bitterness welled in his heart. He had only learned of Huo Poyun’s decision to leak Yun Che’s whereabouts to the Holy Eaves Realm after the fact, and to this day he couldn’t understand why his former disciple had committed such a senseless act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One thing was sure, Yun Che was no longer Huo Poyun’s friend. The fact that Yun Che hadn’t taken revenge on Huo Poyun was the most anyone could expect from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Poyun smiled without fear despite Yun Che’s death threat. He opened his palm and summoned a golden flame, the snow around him melting swiftly because of the heat. “Back then, you and I promised to duel each other after we entered the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm. In the end you didn’t enter the Eternal Heaven Divine Realm, but this looks like as good a time as any to fulfill that promise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Promise?” A scornful smile spread across Yun Che’s lips. “I don’t remember such a thing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It doesn’t matter.” Huo Poyun still looked completely calm. The golden flames in his hand grew thicker and thicker. “I remember, and that’s enough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His entire body burst into flames as he leaped into the air. The golden crow flames in his hand condensing into a flaming sword, he swung the weapon straight at Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Poyun!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All three sect masters turned pale in shock. It was because there was no turning back the second Huo Poyun attacked Yun Che.</span></p>

Huo Poyun easily sent them flying away from him before closing the distance between Yun Che and himself rapidly.</span></p>

So why is he acting like this? Where is this hatred, insanity, and obsession coming from?” Yun Che frowned. “Is Mu Feixue really that important to him? Does he really love her more than the Flame God Realm he spent his whole life dedicating himself to?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Chi Wuyao’s lips curled a little. “Feixue came after you came, and there’s no way Huo Poyun hadn’t noticed her.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The two of you fought, and he lost to you. Your mastery of the elements far exceeded his, and his cultivation far exceeded yours.

Moreover, he was a passionate person, so he valued his friendship with you very, very deeply.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The two of you were ‘equals’ at the time. That’s why the two of you were able to become friends and support each other without any reservations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao paused for a moment before staring at Yun Che’s profile. “So, when do you think this ‘balance’ was broken, and who do you think the culprit behind it was?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che’s pupils narrowed a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao continued, “Jun Xilei defeated him in one strike at the Profound God Convention, and you heavily wounded Jun Xilei in one strike in turn. From your perspective, you were taking revenge for him, when in reality you made him realize the huge gap between you two… and that’s without mentioning the fact that you were the one who showed the might of the Golden Crow flames to the world on the Conferred God Stage, even though he was the true disciple of the Golden Crow Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The ‘balance’ between the two of you was completely shredded. You were completely unaware of this because you were at the top, but he, the one who was left in the dust… for a young man who was only twenty years old or so, especially one who valued his friendship with you to the extent he did, I am sure it was a psychological blow like none other.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At first, all he felt was a sense of loss and frustration, and I’m sure he tried to overcome it. But then, he learned that the woman he fell in love with at first sight… was in love with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao sighed and shook her head. “Disappointment, reluctance, jealousy, indignance, desire, self-pity, and more… all these emotions eventually mingled into something that no one, not even the man tormented by it could say.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You would know this yourself had you thought about it carefully. Huo Poyun and Feixue have barely met each other their whole lives, much less shared any unforgettable or special memories with each other. So how could he possibly be this obsessed with her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“While it is true that he has frequently visited Snow Song Realm to see Mu Feixue after you ‘died’, he has only ever watched her from a distance. Not once has he overstepped his boundaries during this time. Moreover, from my observation of him back when I was still in Snow Song Realm, I knew that he was infatuated with Feixue, but he was nowhere close to being madly in love with her, much less obsessed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, he immediately lost control of himself when he saw you alive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao’s voice became stretched out and soft. “When he saw you and Mu Feixue whispering sweet nothings to each other, he hated that moment so much that he tried to kill you through Luo Guxie. But when he realized that you were about to die in Luo Changsheng’s hands, he risked even his own life to save you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your earlier hunch was correct. Huo Poyun was hoping that you would kill him and learn that he was your savior later. He wanted you to feel a terrible regret that might even accompany you for eternity… and finally beat you for once in his life. But you extinguished his hopes cruelly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was what she said, but Chi Wuyao was the real reason Huo Poyun had failed. Had she not shown Yun Che Luo Changsheng’s memories, the Flame God Realm King would’ve already gotten his wish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is true that he is mindful of Feixue, but he is at least ten times more mindful of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao shot Yun Che one last glance before walking away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che didn’t move for a very long time as the world snowed around him. In the distance, Chanyi’s thoughts were a complete mess as her mouth remained agape for a very long time.</span></p>
