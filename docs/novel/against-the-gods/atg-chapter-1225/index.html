At first, the lotuses only had one layer; a total of nine petals burning as bright as flames. But over time more and more layers of petals added themselves around the lotuses—two layers, three layers, five layers—the lotuses were so suffocatingly beautiful that someone might’ve thought that they had suddenly fallen into a dream.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The instant the thirty-six crimson lotuses bloomed, Luo Changsheng suddenly roared as a thick yellow profound light burst from his body. It was the strongest defensive barrier he could create, and he went on to make a second barrier, a third barrier… a tenth… a twentieth...</span></p>

He didn’t save anything for anything else.</span></p>

Every time a new layer of petals was added to the lotuses, they would become twice as big as before. The spectators watched dumbfoundedly as the fiery lotuses grew to several thousand meters each.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the petals of every lotus came into contact with one another, their fiery auras connected, and a pillar of crimson flame suddenly gushed into the air. The impossibly clear, giant figure of a burning phoenix manifested into existence—it was almost as if the real Phoenix Spirit had descended into the world—and it spread its wings, arched its head and let out a long cry. Every feather on its body was burning with the hottest flames of the Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lotuses actually melted into one another and soundlessly transformed into one giant lotus that was at least several hundred kilometers wide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Juehai’s entire body shook when he saw the beautiful lotus. A hoarse shout escaped his lips, “T-that’s the World Illuminator Red Lotus!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Juehai’s involuntary roar caused everyone around him to widen their eyes even further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blooming red lotus looked beautiful enough to intoxicate a person. It bloomed soundlessly before everyone’s stunned faces and enveloped the entire Conferred God Stage. Its enchanting light gently dyed the surrounding space and sky crimson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But as gentle as it might seem, the giant lotus was a mighty power of the Phoenix that was capable of annihilating seas and burning skies into nothingness!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What… what… what is that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that the legendary… strongest fire lotus of the Phoenix!?” a middle realm king uttered in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che and Luo Changsheng’s figure could no longer be seen on the Conferred God Stage. Everything had been enveloped, no, buried by the silhouette of the gigantic fire lotus. The unimaginably terrifying heat and power caused many souls to shiver all over, even though there was a powerful barrier standing between it and them. They just couldn’t imagine what kind of burning hell existed for the fighters who were right beneath that lotus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect master, is that really… World Illuminator Red Lotus?” a Phoenix Sect disciple stuttered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” But Yan Juehai was staring at the scene blankly. He didn’t react to the question at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master Yan, it’s been a long time since World Illuminator Red Lotus last appeared to the Phoenix Sect, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yan Juehai was breathing heavily. The question finally pulled him back down to earth, but he was still staring at the fire lotus as if he couldn’t bear to look away for even an instant, “It has been ninety thousand years to be exact. Ninety thousand years ago, there was an ancestor in the sect who managed to cultivate World Illuminator Red Lotus. I never thought I’d live to see it bloom once more. Ninety thousand years…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Rulie looked greatly moved by his words. He could understand Yan Juehai’s feelings completely, because it was probably the same as what he had felt when he saw Huo Poyun successfully unleashing Nine Suns Heaven’s Fury for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">World Illuminator Red Lotus was the strongest flame of the World Ode of the Phoenix. It was an ultimate divine flame on the same level as the Golden Crow’s Record of the Burning World’s Nine Suns Heaven’s Fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unlike Nine Suns Heaven’s Fury, it bloomed quietly and prettily when it appeared. But that didn’t stop it from burning its enemy to dust without a sound!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nearly everyone sitting at the Holy Eaves Realm had gotten up to their feet. Even Luo Shangchen&nbsp;and Luo Guxie were keeping Luo Changsheng firmly centered in their spirit perception, a taut expression etched on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One by one, the barriers Luo Changsheng created were devoured by the fire lotus. Every inch of his body was dyed crimson by the fire lotus’ crimson light. Although he was still surrounded by many barriers, he screamed painfully as if he was sinking into the depths of hell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the east side seats, the Brahma Heaven God Emperor’s sent his spirit perception through World Illuminator Red Lotus and onto Luo Changsheng. A moment later, he looked away before snorting quietly and disdainfully, “If Luo Guxie hadn’t warned Luo Changsheng with a sound transmission, he wouldn’t have poured everything he had into defending himself at first notice, and that half a breath’s delay might’ve decided the battle. To think that she would do this in the grand final of the Conferred God Battle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Her actions don’t seem to match her title as the Eastern Divine Region’s number one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the public number one profound practitioner of the Eastern Divine Region, Luo Guxie’s realm was of course very high. No one—not even Honorable Qu Hui—should’ve been able to detect the sound transmission she created. However, that didn’t include the likes of the Brahma Heaven God Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beside him, Qianye Ying’er said indifferently, “If Luo Changsheng was just her nephew or her disciple then yes, she wouldn’t have done what she did. On the other hand, it’s only natural for someone in her ‘position’ to lose her cool in a ‘situation’ like this, no matter how powerful she is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Brahma Heaven God Emperor shot a sideway glance at her. “I don’t understand what you mean.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Earlier today, Uncle Gu had told me something very interesting all of a sudden.” Qianye Ying’er said in a leisurely tone, the corner of her lips tugged into a playful smile. “He told me that Luo Changsheng’s life aura, in a certain ‘way’, is quite similar to Luo Guxie’s.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...What are you trying to say?” Brahma Heaven God Emperor’s eyebrows shot up suddenly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, it’s nothing. It’s just a thought in my mind.” But Qianye Ying’er didn’t reveal the truth, “Auras have never been a reliable thing anyway. I just thought that it was interesting, that’s all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” The Brahma Heaven God Emperor didn’t prod further. He moved his gaze away from her while looking thoughtful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the fire lotus on the Conferred God Stage looked gigantic, it was actually a shrunken version of the real “World Illuminator Red Lotus”. Yun Che’s energy was drained away the instant the fire lotus was unleashed in full, causing him to fall straight toward the ground and the crimson flames around him to die away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he didn’t relax for an instant after the attack was unleashed. He had immediately looked in Luo Changsheng’s general direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng truly is the strongest God Child of the Eastern Divine Region… He immediately constructed his defenses the second I raised the red lotus formation. What an incredible spirit perception and battle instinct… in that case...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Yun Che couldn’t unleash the complete version of World Illuminator Red Lotus, just like he couldn’t summon nine actual suns when he executed Nine Suns Heaven’s Fury. He just didn’t have enough profound energy to manage such a feat.</span></p>

He forcefully reignited the dying flames and pounced toward Luo Changsheng.</span></p>

Before he could even draw one full breath into his lungs, Yun Che had already reached him and sent him flying with his sword. Both the Holy Lightning Sword and the Divine Wind Battleaxe were smacked out of his hands and sent flying in different directions.</span></p>

His arms were screaming, his body was weak, and he was unable to pursue Luo Changsheng further despite the successful strike.</span></p>

He looked like a heavy rock that had been flung into the distance by a hurricane.</span></p>

His white clothes were black and tattered, more than half of his long black hair was burned away, and nearly half his body was completely covered in black marks and scorched holes.</span></p>

He seemed incapable of accepting or believing the reality that had just happened right before him. However, his absent mindedness didn’t last for a very long time.

Every drop of the water could be considered a top tier treasure in the Primal Chaos Dimension. However, Luo Guxie hadn’t used the water on herself after all the trouble she went through to get it. Instead, she had gifted it to Luo Changsheng and even tempered both his body and soul personally. As a result, his body and soul were as tough as a city protected by a wall of metal and a moat of boiling water.</span></p>

The light in her eyes was normally soft and indifferent, but today it was shaking slightly with emotion. She had raised Luo Changsheng singlehandedly since he was a child, and she had never seen him this injured or humiliated until today.</span></p>

Although his facial muscles were still twitching in pain, his pupils were scarily calm.</span></p>
