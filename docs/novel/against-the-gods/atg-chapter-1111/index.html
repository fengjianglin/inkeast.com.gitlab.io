He turned the jade stone around in his palm. Nine gleams of light that shone like stars entered his eyes. For a long while he couldn’t believe his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine Nine Star Buddha Jade… It was what he could only wish for in his dreams… He had been repeatedly told that was extremely difficult to obtain even in the upper star realms. He had “extorted” a vast amount of profound stones from Lei Qianfeng all for the sake of the Divine Nine Star Buddha Jade. In fact, he acknowledged that there was a huge possibility that he would never obtain it, but now… It had landed right in his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if it had just dropped down from heaven and he had simply bent over and picked it up!</span></p>

He grinned from ear to ear, wanting to laugh but his emotions were in such a flux that he temporarily forgot how to laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Qianfeng had been dead for quite a while, and his corpse had started to whiten, however that terrifying and threatening face of his suddenly looked so pleasing to Yun Che’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lei Qianfeng, you committed countless evil deeds while you were alive, but in your death… You’ve done a really big, good deed! If you had handed this thing over to me earlier… I might even have let your sons die a faster and quicker death!” Yun Che started mumbling to Lei Qianfeng. His heart was racing as he put away this piece of jade that had literally “fallen from the heavens”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jasmine,” Yun Che lifted his head and smiled with fond remembrance. “Looks like even the heavens want me to find you once more. All I’m lacking now is the stalk of Immortal Emperor Grass. I will definitely… definitely find you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him, a weak yet familiar aura steadily neared him. Yun Che stopped his fantasizing and turned around. He saw a girl wearing a seven colored dress flying in his direction, her lips letting out a sweet and beautiful tune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Petals of jasmine are white, sprinkles of dahlia are rainbow, rose isn't cute at all, and moonflower’s a big perverted freak... Ah! Brother-in-law!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She suddenly saw Yun Che, as Little Jasmine called out to him she flew over cheerfully laughing, “Hehe, so you’re here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Darkya Realm was huge and yet he always ran into her. Yun Che had already gotten used to it. Although this little girl was an enigma, he was already too lazy to dig further. He replied with a helpless look on his face, “Where did you run off to?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, you still have the sincerity to ask me.” Little Jasmine scrunched her nose and swiped her thumb across it. “You suddenly sat there without moving and ignored me for so long. Of course I decided to go off and play by myself. When I came back, you had disappeared. Did you… Did you leave me behind on purpose!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che was speechless for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah! Brother-in-law, what’s that in your hand? What a pretty light.” Little Jasmine skipped up to him and held his hand up. She revealed a look of disappointment, “It’s only a Profound Imagery Stone, and I wondered what sort of fun toy it was. Eh… you’re holding it in your palm, did you record something fun? I wanna see! I wanna see!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Qianfeng had put these two Profound Imagery Stones together with the Nine Star Buddha Divine Jade. They obviously contained some very important recordings. Yun Che was also pretty curious, so he replied, “Alright, alright, but first you have to promise me. Whatever you see, you must absolutely not tell anyone else about it without my prior approval.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s a given, girls who spread nonsense are detestable,” Little Jasmine replied immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che tilted his lips, inserting a small amount of profound energy into the first Profound Imagery Stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An image projected outward from the center of the Profound Imagery Stone. Yun Che saw Lei Qianfeng’s figure, his official wife Xiao Qingtong was with him. At the side was an outstanding looking young man who exuded an aura of nobility. Behind that young man was a cold and hard looking middle aged man… Although it was an image from the Profound Imagery Stone, he still gave Yun Che a heavy and oppressive feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che raised his eyebrows. He vaguely guessed the identity of these two individuals, however their conversation left him reeling in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh uncle, uncle. Concerning the Royal Wood Spirit, my royal father who rarely gets angry is furious right now…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Guike! You have to help your uncle…”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ………………</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che solemnly watched it to the end. His frowning eyebrows were tensed. As the images vanished, he kept the Profound Imagery Stone tightly held in his hand. Although it was just a Profound Imagery Stone, it suddenly seemed tens of thousands of times heavier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because within this tiny Profound Imagery Stone, were held the recordings, voices which were more than enough to ruin the reputation of the Divine Martial Realm King, and would even cause them to suffer possible sanctions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That young man in question was no doubt the son of the Great Realm King—Wu Guike! And as Ruyan had mentioned, the one who accompanied and protected him was most likely a frightening Divine Sovereign Realm expert. As for this recording, the undulations of the individuals within, the clarity of the images, all of their mannerisms, their gazes and expressions were recorded with utmost clarity. Every expression was perfectly captured and their voices were loud and clear, it was as if it was recorded at a very short distance. And this Wu Guike, who had this Divine Sovereign expert “Chengyan” beside him, actually hadn’t realized at all?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How did Lei Qianfeng accomplish this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So boring. It’s just strange people saying strange stuff. No fun at all,” Little Jasmine grumbled with a disappointed look on her face. However her expression suddenly flashed. She giggled, “However that big sister wearing that green dress looks really pretty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this piece of Profound Imagery Stone in hand, as long as the time was right, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that he now had a hold over the Divine Martial Realm! And this was a relatively major hold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being able to have a hold over an upper star realm, and all the way up to its Great Realm King… what sort of concept was this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che was now filled with curiosity towards the next Profound Imagery Stone, he quickly held it up and inserted some profound energy into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the images started to appear, the heavy breathing of a man and the pleasured cries of a woman rang out. Then appearing within the recording was a couple, a man and a woman, doing “it”. The time was in the middle of the night and the light of the moon shone on their faces making it so that their faces could clearly be seen.</span></p>

On one side of his ears was the voice of an angry young girl screaming at him. Little Jasmine covered her eyes and jumped away, her face a deep shade of red. “You… You… You bad guy, sex fiend, super duper pervert! You’re actually so disgusting. This… This kind of disgusting thing… You you you…!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“~！@#￥%……” Yun Che hurriedly put away the Profound Imagery Stone and held up both his hands in defense, “These are not my things, I just happened to pick them up just now.”</span></p>

You really are a big bad guy!” Little Jasmine cried out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che shrugged his shoulders helplessly. “Alright alright, I’m a despicable super duper pervert, so in future you shouldn’t follow me anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished, he grabbed Lei Qianfeng’s corpse and started flying.</span></p>

Where are you going? Ah!! Wait for meeee!” Little Jasmine brought both little hands down from her eyes as she rushed after him.</span></p>

Who asked you to be my brother-in-law? Even though you’re a big bad degenerate pervert I still have to acknowledge you… wuu… I’m so pitiful.” Little Jasmine’s face was a picture of pity.</span></p>

Yun Che brought Lei Qianfeng’s body with him and flew past Black Soul Mountain, circling around Darkya City, and arrived south of the Darkya City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the destroyed secret realm where the wood spirit race had lived.

He threw Lei Qianfeng onto the ground and then knelt down and closed his eyes.</span></p>

She asked, “Brother-in-law, where is this place. What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che lowered his head softly replying, “This place was once a hidden world. Many wood spirits lived safely in this place. They were very kind to me, but not long ago, all of them were killed because of me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Little Jasmine blinked</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a period of silence, Yun Che opened his eyes and reached out with his palm. A ball of fire landed on Lei Qianfeng’s corpse and started to burn. In a flash ashes started to fly and drifted everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Granny Qing Ye, Senior Qing Mu… Qing He… Fei Yan… Qing Zhu… I owe all of you. Aside from bringing ingyou this evildoer who has harmed your race for countless generations and turn him to ashes as a comfort to your spirits, I can never repay this debt that I owe all of you. From now on, the only thing I can do, and what I will do with all my might, is to protect each and every other wood spirit I meet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He Lin, I’m about to leave the Darkya Realm, but I promise you that I will definitely find your older sister. I swear this. Perhaps the Heavenly Mystery Realm can shed some light on her whereabouts. When I find her, if she agrees, I will bring her back to the planet I was born in. There, she will be safe and not suffer from any bullying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Lei Qianfeng’s ashes had finished scattering, the wind here grew much gentler.</span></p>

Little Jasmine then said, “Brother-in-law, you said just now that you want to go to the Heavenly Mystery Realm, is that true?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course. I have things and people that I need to find. The God Realm is so vast, and I’m alone. Whoever can help me should most likely be in the Heavenly Mystery Realm… I hope that mysterious and secretive realm will not disappoint me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh…” The girl had a conflicted expression on her face. She pressed her nose and hurriedly said, “Brother-in-law, I think it would be best for you not go to the Heavenly Mystery Realm. Even if you go, there’ll be no point.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che glared at her. “How do you know?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che squinted and he lowered his head, “Little girl, you still have yet to tell me, who are you and where are you from? No matter where I go, you’re always able to accurately pinpoint my location… Who are you really? What is your motive for getting close to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s because… You’re my life saving benefactor, and also my brother-in-law!” Little Jasmine looked at him with sincerity.</span></p>

Are you someone… from the Heavenly Mystery Realm?”</span></p>
