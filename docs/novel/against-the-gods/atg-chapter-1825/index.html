They had also very rarely forced someone into compliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because the Dragon God race’s pride and strength caused them to look down on such methods. To them, such things were unnecessary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the command that Long Bai had just given was extremely tyrannical and unyielding. He had even said the words “they can’t blame me for being ruthless”!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eight Dragon Gods themselves were completely and utterly shocked by those words, so they could well imagine what sort of waves it would cause when it reached the ears of the five king realms of the Western Divine Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, once they recovered from their shock, the eight Dragon Gods felt blood rushing through their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ash Dragon God had died a miserable death and the Crimson Destruction Dragon God had been utterly shamed and humiliated, so the proud dragon blood that had lain dormant in the eight Dragon Gods for countless years had been brought to a boil due to their shared wrath and indignation. As a result, Long Bai’s sudden heavy-handedness and ruthless decisiveness stirred them up much more than it had shocked them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Bai only wanted the Divine Masters of the five king realms. This battle was going to be the grandest battle in the history of the God Realm, so he really only did need the Divine Masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anybody who was weaker than a Divine Master would be no more than an ant in the upcoming battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” The Azure Dragon God shouted, but he immediately continued after that, “All of the upper star realms have also prepared for battle, do we…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need,” Long Bai replied in a grave voice. “These upper star realms only have one or two Divine Masters apiece and all of them have their own grievances and petty squabbles, their own habits and idiosyncrasies. They are nothing more than a tray of loose sand. Furthermore, most of them won’t be able to get here within forty-eight hours, so it’s pointless to mobilize them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Also.” Long Bai turned around, the touch of his dark and somber gaze making everyone feel as if a mountain had landed on their shoulders. “Summon back any and all of the Dragon Sovereigns and Master Dragons who are still abroad. This is a matter of extreme importance, so all of them need to rush back within the next forty-eight hours!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Bai’s voice was calm and serious, but it was enough to shake the entire Dragon God Domain. As the hearts and souls of all those who were present trembled, they also noticed that Long Bai’s determination to wipe out the Northern Divine Region far exceeded even their wildest imaginations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Xuzi found it hard to contain the excitement that was blooming on his wizened face. Before this moment, he had feared that the Dragon Monarch would do one of two things. The first was that the Dragon Monarch would completely underestimate the Northern Divine Region and the second was that he would be arrogant enough to disdain making any big moves, instead choosing to wait for Yun Che to come to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, all those worries were for naught. The Dragon Monarch had returned and he had summoned all of the Dragon Gods, Dragon Sovereigns, and Master Dragons back to the Dragon God Realm. He had even forcibly conscripted all of the Divine Masters in the Western Region’s five king realms… The grand scale of this mobilization and the ruthless decisiveness that drove it convinced everyone present that the doom of the devil race was nigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If the Dragon Monarch is going to be this vigilant, the Northern Divine Region is sure to die!” Zhou Xuzi mumbled to himself as he closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Azure, Jade, Pure, White Rainbow, Cyan Abyss, Purple River, Sky.” Long Bai read out the titles of the Dragon Gods one by one. “All of you are to personally see to the order that I just gave. There must be no mistakes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Crimson Destruction, you are to follow me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">————</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Southern Divine Region, Ten Directions Deep Sea Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The jade finger that Chi Wuyao had pressed in the space in between her eyes unconsciously twitched as the black light in her eyes slowly transformed into a boundlessly deep vortex of darkness. A look of unprecedented solemness had also appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What sort of situation would cause a huge power to choose to cut off all methods of retreat and leave no room for error?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had thought only the devil of the Northern Divine Region had the resolve to throw their lives away like this, and this had been due to their million years of hatred and resentment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Long Bai, who stood above the entire universe and controlled the exalted Dragon God Realm in the palm of his hands had used his authority as the Dragon Monarch to give a similar order...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This definitely wasn’t due to the fact that he suddenly viewed the Northern Divine Region as a proper threat… It was clear that there was a dreadfully twisted reason for his actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A warped distortion in his heart induced by extreme hate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao felt a headache gathering at her temples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Monarch loved the Dragon Queen and viewed her as a treasure, this was something the entire God Realm knew about. However, Chi Wuyao knew a very long time ago that the Dragon Monarch’s infatuation with Shen Xi had far exceeded what any normal person could ever imagine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was at this moment that Chi Wuyao realized that she had been mistaken. The Dragon Monarch’s feelings toward Shen Xi could no longer be called simple infatuation. They had evolved into a crazed obsession!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He practically valued her more than the entire Dragon God Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Northern Divine Region had had a huge advantage against the other three divine regions in their previous fights, and that was their resolve to fight to the death. On the other hand, the major powers of the other three divine regions had put their survival first and foremost and none of them were willing to gamble their tens of thousands of years of power in a desperate life-or-death struggle against the devils of the north.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This huge advantage had just vanished into the aether now that they were facing the strongest Dragon God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Monarch, who should have been the most steady and calculative person in the universe, had actually chosen a method that even a common realm king would consider extreme. He had not only chosen to mobilize the entire core of the Dragon God Realm’s power, but he was even forcefully conscripting the core forces of the other five king realms of the Western Divine Region.</span></p>

If that happens, the threat that awaits us in the future will be boundless.”</span></p>
