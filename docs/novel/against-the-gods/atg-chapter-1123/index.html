Within sight were the familiar ice crystal embers. The breath coming from his nose felt that familiar pure and clean chilly air. In front of him, the girl that was all smiles was Mu Xiaolan, who he hadn’t seen in the longest time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was… the Snow Song Realm’s… Thirty-sixth Ice Phoenix Palace.</span></p>

When you arrived you were unconscious. I even thought you were injured, but then I noticed that you were completely fine,” Mu Xiaolan excitedly said, while staring at him with both her bright and clear eyes. “Where did you run off to all this time? Why were you unconscious? Master said that you went travelling outside to train. I thought you’d spend a few more good years before you’d bother to return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Xiaolan was saying quite a lot of stuff. The still dazed Yun Che didn’t register what she was saying. He shook his head, trying to recall the scene before he fainted. He asked listlessly, “Where’s Master?”</span></p>

It was Sect Master’s Saint Dragon that brought you back here.” Looking at Yun Che’s strange expression, Mu Xiaolan hesitated a little but she couldn’t contain her curiosity, “Yun Che, did something happen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che shook his head, unable to answer.</span></p>

Mu Bingyun slowly stepped in, her demeanor and gaze as cold as always.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Although she was curious, Mu Xiaolan still obediently left the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Bingyun walked towards him, her gaze turning complicated as she continued looking at Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che lowered his head, for the first time not daring to meet Mu Bingyun’s eyes. This was because he knew that he had committed a serious sin, she was his benefactor and more importantly, Mu Xuanyin’s younger sister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where did your master find you?” Mu Bingyun asked, her voice familiar and gentle as ever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the east. At the heart of the Illusory Sea Island there’s a secret realm called the Illusory Sea Ancient Realm,” Yun Che replied, head still lowered, his conscience still pricking him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As expected…”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che shook his head, “I don’t know, I just saw Master and then I saw her getting angry… Next thing I know, I woke up here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Mu Bingyun didn’t continue asking, but didn’t look worried. Afterall, with Mu Xuanyin’s power, regardless of where she went, there was no need to worry about her. Her gaze lifted off Yun Che’s body, her chest heaving a little, showing quite obviously that her heart wasn’t at rest. Her soft and gentle voice had an added tinge of coldness to it, “Yun Che, everything that you’ve done in the Flame God Realm… I know about it all… Apart from your master, I’m the only one who knows.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s face darkened. “I know… my sin is unpardonable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re indeed unpardonable.” Mu Bingyun’s voice had some fluctuation to it. She turned around, afraid that if her gaze stayed on Yun Che for too long, her heart that had been icy and cold for a thousand years would lose control. “The sect master isn’t only the Snow Song Realm King or the Divine Ice Phoenix Sect Master. She’s the most powerful person that the Snow Song Realm has ever seen in the last few hundred thousand years. Her status is well respected and she’s the strongest, a fact undisputed from ancient times until now. Even an emperor of a country would not dare to look directly at her, let alone be within a hundred feet of her. If he were to offend her with even half a sentence, he would not be spared the death sentence!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And she’s your master!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yet you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though it was only her back that faced Yun Che, her voice still lost its calm. Her beautiful figure trembled and was only able to recover after a long while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although that incident happened a long while back, she was still unable to accept it and forgive Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if she was the one that Yun Che had “sinned” against half a year ago, she wouldn’t be as disturbed as she was now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s head was still kept down. He didn’t refute her… nor was he able to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The sect master was gravely injured and her body was poisoned by the horned dragon’s blood. There was no way she could save herself but you had already brought her away and fled. You could definitely have borrowed the strength of all three Flame Sect Masters and easily expelled the horned dragon’s blood from her, why did you still have to…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t trust them!” Yun Che lifted his head and shouted, “I was afraid that they would take advantage of Master being injured and hurt her. I also didn’t want to have the possibility of negligence, of them making a mistake…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was resentful of the Yan Wancang trio who had selfishly refused to head out and save her. He hated them so much he even harbored some murderous intent, doubting their motives. Even if they were willing to go all out to save her, there would definitely have been skin contact. With Mu Xuanyin’s high and mighty personality, how would she be able to eventually accept it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he was speaking, halfway through, he found himself unable to continue.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Apart from borrowing the powers of those three sect masters, there’s another matter which you don’t know about,” Mu Bingyun replied. “The sect master’s body has a large amount of Ice Phoenix soul origin. Although she lost all her profound strength and became delirious, just the ancient horned dragon’s blood alone is not enough to threaten her soul or life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che lifted his head in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What you’ve committed is the most unforgivable sin in the history of the Snow Song Realm. However, it still must be said that before that, you had just saved the sect master’s life… Or else, she would have fallen within the Ancient God Burying Inferno Prison.”</span></p>

Palace Master Bingyun, you were the one who brought me to the Snow Song Realm, and it was you who then looked after me. I will never forget what you’ve done for me no matter what. It’s just that… I no longer have any chance to repay you.”</span></p>

He wouldn’t be able to redeem himself even if he underwent the punishment of death by a thousand cuts ten thousand times.</span></p>

He wasn’t going to run anymore.</span></p>

He didn’t know how Mu Xuanyin found him. When he was in the Darkya Realm, Huo Rulie swore to keep his whereabouts a secret. In the Darkya Realm, he used the pseudonym, Ling Yun. The only one who knew he was “Yun Che” was only Ji Ruyan.</span></p>

Even when he cultivated, he chose the deepest and most aura obscuring Black Soul Mountain Range.</span></p>

She couldn't find any trace of you. The reason why she headed towards Illusory Sea Island was because she received news that the Immortal Emperor Grass had appeared. In order to prevent others from taking it away she chose to personally retrieve it. That's because it was absolutely necessary for helping you refine the Universe Penta Jade Pellet.”</span></p>

It was as if his soul had been sucked out of him. After a long while, he stretched his hand out and placed his palm on his chest. Something in there was violently churning, unable to rest.</span></p>

Space was being shattered constantly and living beings were perishing. Even the laws within seemed to be on the verge of collapsing.</span></p>

The Snow Song Realm and their Flame God Realm neighbor knew more about her strength than anyone. But right now, be it Yun Che, or anyone else in the Divine Ice Phoenix Sect, or even the Flame God Realm’s three sect masters, should any of them witness this sight before them, they would never dare believe their eyes.</span></p>

Despite being under those conditions, she still managed to forcefully kill one horned dragon and then, using a large amount of blood essence, unleashed “Broken Moon Oblivion”. It not only exacerbated her injuries, it caused her to lose a large amount of her cultivation and innate talent.</span></p>

Yun Che estimated that Mu Xuanyin would perhaps be in a coma for many months. As for recovering her profound strength, she’d need many years, perhaps even much longer.</span></p>

Even if the entire world was turned upside down, not even a speck of dust would land on her. When the Snow Princess Sword pointed out, all beings froze in place. Nine ice rings formed and then overlapped, creating a large frosty formation that fell toward the bloody wolf image.</span></p>
