After that, he slowly walked towards Yun Che, who was lying senseless in a pool of blood, as a demonic and vicious aura, which had not existed before, rose from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Honorable Qu Hui did not yet announce that the battle had ended. Because even though Yun Che’s aura was extremely weak, he still held onto consciousness and had not fainted. Furthermore, he had not admitted defeat either… On the contrary, the light that faintly gathered in his eyes still shone with discontent and a desire to continue his struggle—This desire to struggle seemed instinctive at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Yun, he… hasn’t lost consciousness?” Huo Poyun asked in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng had slowly sauntered over in front of Yun Che. A dark, cold, baleful aura engulfed Yun Che as Luo Changsheng raised his arm… and just when everyone present thought that he would generate a tempest to blow his helpless opponent off the Conferred God Stage, a terrifying windstorm suddenly started forming in his palm. After that, he mercilessly sent the attack hurtling down toward Yun Che amidst the countless horrified shouts of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even a Yun Che that was in peak condition would not be able to resist this blow, much less a Yun Che who was terribly wounded and could barely muster any profound strength to block this attack. Amidst a heart-wrenching, gigantic explosion, Yun Che’s internal organs exploded out like a volcano but he was not even able to let out a groan. His body had turned into a broken and bloody meatsack that was being tossed about within the windstorm before it sent him flying into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yun Che!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brot… Brother Yun!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ahhhhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the gathered members of the Snow Song and Flame God Realms were so shocked and frightened by this turn of events that their faces had turned a ghastly white. The people from the other star realms also all had stunned expressions on their faces. Honorable Qu Hui’s brows furrowed greatly at this and he looked like he could barely wait to announce the end of this fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was the distinguished Young Master Changsheng, an incomparable existence who had broken through to the Divine King Realm in thirty years. Yet to think that he had actually launched such a vicious attack against a severely wounded and helpless Yun Che.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che fell to the ground from the sky, painting an extremely long trail of blood behind him as his body skidded across the floor of the Conferred God Stage. The large blood cloud in the sky, which did not dissipate for a long time, caused all the hearts of all the profound practitioners in the divine way watching to constrict.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The place where Yun Che finally stopped, was merely a few steps away from the boundary of the Conferred God Stage. He lay there unmoving and silent. Luo Changsheng’s vicious and cruel strike was not something that Yun Che could have defended against. Even if he were to be smashed to death right then and there, no one would have been surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even though Honourable Qu Hui’s expression had changed, he still did not declare the end of the duel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo Changsheng… to think that he actually…” Huo Rulie gasped as his rage reached its apex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, this is his true nature it seems,” Yan Juehai said in a deep voice. But after that, his complexion suddenly changed, “Huh, why hasn’t the fight been declared over? Could it be that Yun Che… still hasn’t fainted? What is he doing? Why the hell is he still holding on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s body was covered with heavy wounds and his aura was as thin as gossamer. In this kind of condition, one would not even need to act as any other person would have fainted dead away in this situation. So there could only be one reason for why Yun Che still maintained consciousness, and that was because he was still struggling. Furthermore, this was an extreme struggle that used every single shred of his remaining will in order to prevent himself from fainting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng’s body flickered as he arrived once more in front of Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che lay paralyzed in a pool of his own blood, his entire body ruptured open. His injuries were so severe that even a bloodthirsty person would have a hard time looking at him and his aura was extremely weak and thin as well. Yet, despite being in such a terrible state, Yun Che’s body continued to twitch weakly and his blurry eyes still shone with a weak, but incredibly tenacious light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changhsheng extended an arm and grabbed Yun Che by the throat. He lifted him up from the ground and stared intensely into those eyes which still glimmered with the faintest of light… He did not know why, but even though Yun Che had been completely crushed by him to this extent, had been reduced to a broken doll that he could manipulate every which way, he still did not feel too much satisfaction in his heart, and it still felt like there was something that was stubbornly squeezing his heart and soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because, when it came to Yun Che, the reality was that the jealousy and fear Luo Changsheng held toward Yun Che far exceeded his hatred of the man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could use Manifest Gods, he could fuse together divine flames, and he could even release that absurdly powerful dragon soul…. His profound strength was merely at the Divine Tribulation Realm, yet he could defeat the Luo Changsheng who had been at the peak of the Divine Spirit Realm. And now, once again, even though he was still at the Divine Tribulation Realm, Yun Che was actually able to seriously wound his Divine King body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were things that he was completely unable to do and they were things that he would never be able to do in his entire life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So how could he not feel jealousy!? How could he not feel fear!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he would never concede this point. He was the number one person among the Eastern Divine Region’s young generation, so how could he feel jealousy or fear towards someone else!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even up to now, Yun Che had still not given up and this greatly subtracted from the satisfaction he was feeling. He raised his arm high in the air, dangling Yun Che high up in the air… The border of the Conferred God Stage was right in front of them and he would only need to blow on Yun Che lightly to push him off the Conferred God Stage to end this ridiculously lopsided battle, while also bringing an end to this round’s Conferred God Battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Luo Changsheng suddenly twisted his body instead. He gave a deep bellow and profound light surged around his body before he fiercely smashed Yun Che onto the Conferred God Stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yun Che!!” Mu Bingyun cried out as her snowy complexion instantly lost all color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BANG!!!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One could well imagine just how frightful Luo Changsheng’s profound strength was right now and under this enormous force, even a Divine Spirit profound practitioner, who was using all of his profound strength, would instantly be smashed apart and reduced to a badly mangled mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Yun Che’s body heavily smashed onto the floor, a huge explosion rang out and the floor of the Conferred God Stage actually cracked. After that, Yun Che’s body was sent flying nearly ten kilometers into the air before lifelessly dropping from the sky like a dried and wilted leaf, his body accompanied by a bright red rain of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

After that, he hurtled directly towards Yun Che and he fiercely smashed his elbow into Yun Che’s heart area as countless pairs of shocked eyes looked on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BANG!!!!!!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Honourable Qu Hui’s brows abruptly sank and it was clear that he had lost some of his composure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On a distant cloud far away from the battle, blood seeped between Jasmine’s clenched fingers as her entire body trembled. A bloody light gleamed in her eyes as she desperately fought to suppress her killing intent. She seemed like a vicious animal which was on the verge of going wild at any moment:</span></p>

Yet he still stubbornly clung onto consciousness, refusing to give in to the darkness, despite the vicious and heavy blows that were dealt to him by Luo Changsheng…. Under this kind of force, the fact that he was still alive could already be counted as a minor miracle and nobody could even imagine how extreme one’s will and belief must be to be able to continue to hold on.</span></p>

Was he dissatisfied with this turn of events and still trying to achieve a victory? But in this current scenario, what hope did he have of actually overturning it? This was something that he himself should be well aware of…. So what exactly was he holding on for? He would rather allow Luo Changsheng to trample all over him than to surrender his consciousness to the beckoning darkness….</span></p>

His eyes were narrowed into slits as he spoke in a dark and heavy voice, “Yun Che, I am, all of a sudden, seized by a sense of admiration for you. To think that you would still refuse to faint despite enduring until now. That is certainly strange. So should I say that you’re firm and unyielding? Or should I say that you’re simply stupid as can be?”</span></p>

The force behind Luo Changsheng’s kick was shockingly enough directed at Yun Che’s profound veins. &nbsp;She stood up in a flash and arrived in the air above the Conferred God Stage. Once there, she said with a pleading expression, “Honourable Qu Hui, I beg you that you look the other way and allow this junior to say a few words to Yun Che. This junior is deeply aware that the rules of the Conferred God Battle are not to be violated but if this continues… Yun Che will be lucky to survive.”</span></p>

This battle is one that you will definitely lose. Allow yourself to faint and this competition will come to a close. You will be placed second in the tournament and come out of it covered in glory. However, if you continue to stubbornly hold on, Luo Changsheng will be allowed to continue dealing you legal attacks and no one will be able to interfere! So don’t ruin your own future just over a momentary and unexplainable fit of pique!”&nbsp;</span></p>

His steps slowed even more, but two cruel and vicious whirls of hurricane energy had quietly begun congealing inside his palms.</span></p>
