Once Caizhi had left, the atmosphere had become rather weird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whew,” Yun Che let out a long sigh of relief, “Jasmine, are you doing this to protect me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jasmine was absolutely not the kind of person who would mess around, and she most definitely would not mess around when it came to Caizhi’s marriage. So even though Yun Che’s forehead was matted with sweat, he had not objected too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!” Jasmine’s small face turned the other way, “You’re delusional. But you and Caizhi have exchanged keepsakes and bowed to the heavens and the earth, so now the both of you are already husband and wife. Since this has now been established as fact, you’re not allowed to ask about it anymore. You will understand… in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course I know that you wouldn’t hurt me or Caizhi, but it’s just that… this entire affair is simply too weird. This concerns her marriage! Anyone else would also find it hard to simply just accept this in a short period of time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hard to accept?” Jasmine said as she cast a sidelong glance at Yun Che before snorting yet again, “Then why can’t I even feel a single iota of unwillingness emanating from your body? Hmph! You gained something good but you’re still pretending to be obedient.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cough cough.” Even the thick-skinned Yun Che blushed at that as he struggled to explain himself, “Of course I’m okay with it. If this is truly your heart’s desire, I would be fine even if you asked me to marry an old female pig, much less your little sister. But for Caizhi… this is something that is definitely far more serious to her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh really?” Jasmine said with a cold smile, “Then let me go wrangle up an old female pig and bring her back here right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait, wait, wait, wait!” Yun Che’s legs went limp as he anxiously reached out and grabbed Jasmine’s arm in panic, “Okay, okay, I won’t ask you why you’re doing this. But how are we supposed to explain this to your father… Uh, I mean, how are we going to explain this to the Star God Emperor?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Caizhi doesn’t have a father,” Jasmine said as her voice grew cold, “There’s no need to account for this to that old villain. He isn’t worthy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every time she mentioned that “old villain”, Jasmine’s aura grew cold and a bone-piercing hatred would almost reflexively rise up from her entire body… there was even killing intent as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hatred she bore for Xing Juekong had long since sunk into her bone marrow and perhaps it would never ever be able to dispelled for as long as she lived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, even if he does know about it, he won’t say anything anyways.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che was stunned by those words before he asked, “Why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s something that you don’t need to be bothered about,” Jasmine did not give a direct reply. Instead she turned around and said, “Remember what I said before! You must treat Caizhi as well as you treat any of your other women! You’re not allowed to favor anyone else over her, if not… I’ll never forgive you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fine.” Yun Che said with a smile, “I’ll treat Caizhi just as good as I treat Jasmine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had originally thought those words would definitely earn him that cold and arrogant stare of Jasmine’s, and maybe she might even send him flying with a kick. But contrary to his expectations, Jasmine did not lash out at him. Instead, she went silent for a bit before replying in an extremely sincere voice, “Good, remember those words that you’ve just said.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mn?” Yun Che was stunned by that reaction and his gaze grew suspicious as he looked Jasmine once over, “How come you’re acting so weird today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s weird!?” Jasmine said with a light snort, but after that she averted her gaze as if she did not quite dare to stare at Yun Che. At the same time, she coldly and forcefully changed the topic, “It doesn’t matter whether you’re willing or not, you and Caizhi have already said your vows before heaven and earth and exchanged keepsakes. All of this was done with her mother, her maternal aunt and I as witnesses. So the two of you are already husband and wife! You… what’s your impression of Caizhi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che thought about it for a while before saying, “Caizhi and I have not interacted with each other for very long. However, I have managed to gather two unique impressions about her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Which two?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The first is that she regards you as more important than herself, far more important at that,” Yun Che said in an exceptionally serious tone of voice as he looked at Jasmine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they had met in the Darkya Realm, once she had figured out who he was, she helped him out in various ways from the dark… She even called him, a person with such a lowly cultivation and background, “Brother-in-law” with such gusto… Her excitement and high spirits upon seeing him in the Star God Realm… The way she had imparted the Heavenly Wolf Hell God’s Tome, that belonged exclusively to her, to him in such a completely unreserved fashion... And the way she had acquiesced to the marriage that Jasmine had forced on her even though she felt aggrieved by it...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of these things told Yun Che that Jasmine occupied an extremely important place in Caizhi’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Jasmine softly bit on her bottom lip before saying, “And?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The other thing is that…” Yun Che’s eyes flashed faintly as he said this, “She is far from the naive and innocent little girl who knows nothing of the world that she makes herself out to be. On the contrary… she is extremely clever and very good at hiding her true self.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jasmine’s eyes turned as an expression of faint shock crossed her face, “Why do you believe that is so?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When I met her in the Darkya Realm, I always had the impression that she was just this little princess that some big family had spoiled rotten as she displayed various whimsical actions and often seemed to have an exaggerated opinion of her own abilities... But now that I think about the words and actions she had said and done during that time, I realize one thing. Every single word she said and every single action she had performed were very strong and focused probes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From the very first moment she called me Brother-in-law, she had actually already completely verified my identity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, while I was in the Darkya Realm, you could say that she played me like a fiddle,” Yun Che said with a helpless expression on his face. “And to be honest, I’ve met very few people who could play me like that in my lifetime. However, she wasn’t playing tricks on me for fun, she was actually testing the feelings that I had for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was probably when she was very satisfied with the results of her probing that she decided to help me find that ‘Divine Nine Star Buddha Jade’ in the end. She also even gifted me with a Void Illusion Stone as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to Yun Che, it was Wu Guike who had been played with by Caizhi until he wished to die...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when she was in front of Jasmine, Yun Che did not detect any scheming or shrewdness from her. The only thing he saw was a completely open and unguarded heart, a young and tender maiden who did not hold anything back and did not defy her elder sister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was even to the point that there was a little bit of cautiousness and prudence mixed in, just because she was unwilling to see her older sister get the least bit angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re right on the mark,” Jasmine said in a much softer voice as she gently closed her eyes. “Caizhi is indeed very intelligent, she is also very good at hiding her true nature.

The old villain and all of the people in Star God City were then even more convinced that she was the ‘Heavenly Cursed Lone Star’. Everyone rejected her and no one dared to even approach her. They threw her in some abandoned bedchamber, not caring if she lived or died. If it was not for Big Brother bringing her back and Mother taking her in, she would have long ago followed my maternal aunt into death.”</span></p>

How could he do such a thing… as abandoning a newborn baby to its fate?”</span></p>

All for the sake of avenging Mother and Big Brother and also so I’d have the ability to leave the Star God Realm forever with Caizhi.”</span></p>

In order to not allow me any opportunity to purge the poison from my body, the ones who ambushed me chased me over a great distance... By the time I managed to shake their pursuit, the poison had already spread to my soul. After that, everyone thought that I was dead, even I myself did not believe that I could survive after that.”</span></p>

During the time I spent in the Profound Sky Continent, Caizhi was also the only thing that tied me to the Star God Realm. When I followed Moonflower back to the Star God Realm, Caizhi was also the most important reason.”</span></p>

Those old fogeys from the Institute of Elders had also said that her star destiny had changed from the ‘Heavenly Cursed Lone Star’ to the ‘Heavenly Wolf Star’, so Caizhi’s status was naturally completely different from what it had been before. She had gone from being spurned by everyone to being revered by all.”</span></p>

He had never thought, nor could he ever have imagined, that this pure and strange girl, whose eyes were as pure as an elf’s, and who always seemed to have a sweet and winsome smile on her face, had actually lived such a nightmarish existence.</span></p>

All those years ago, my big brother had only been able to obtain the approval of the Heavenly Wolf divine power because his talent and comprehension of the profound way was incredibly high.”</span></p>

Furthermore, she had a nearly perfect compatibility with it. Do you know why?”</span></p>

Furthermore, the Heavenly Wolf Hell God’s Tome had been born of obsession and hatred as well. The heavier the hatred and resentment, the greater the power displayed by the Heavenly Wof Hell God’s Tome would be.</span></p>

The movement had been very light but it carried with it an extremely heavy oppressiveness, “After the news of my death had reached her ears, Caizhi was completely trapped inside her own hatred and resentment... The hatred she held towards the entire world, and… the hatred she held towards herself.”</span></p>

It would be impossible for you to understand this sword style even if you spend ten thousand years pondering over it! It’s forever impossible for a foolish person like you to ever get that ‘opportunity’. Do you get it!?”</span></p>

When Caizhi had said those words, she had done so with a tone and smile of exultation as she pranced around in delight. But now that he thought back to that scene, he now knew that what lay behind each and every one of those words, was a heaviness that normal folk could not even begin to imagine.</span></p>
