The profound energy he was releasing from his body completely dissipated and his body collapsed to the ground in a heap. His limbs were spastically convulsing and hoarse wails of pain ripped from his throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Wanhun and Yan Wangui also fell to the ground. They writhed on the ground in pain as their wails filled the air. It was as if they were wild dogs that had been thrown into a pot of boiling oil and were frantically trying to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Wanchi was only an instant away from unleashing his full might when he felt his strength drain away. This caused him to experience an incredible energy backlash and as his own chaotic energy and sacred light wracked his body, he howled like a despairing wild beast that had lost all of its limbs. He writhed on the ground in incredible despair and frenzied agony.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the area were illuminated, any spectator would be able to see that the bodies of the Three Yama Ancestors were swiftly rotting away and disappearing into the air itself. Their skin looked like layers of scorched leather which was peeling back and their stark white bones were soon revealed… Their exposed skulls even started smoking after that, as white tendrils began to float into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just as expected.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che ignored Yan Wanhun and Yan Wangui, who were both wildly fleeing in panic. Instead, light profound energy continued to radiate from his body as he unhurriedly walked toward Yan Wanchi. “Your lives and souls rely on the darkness profound energy in this place to keep existing so the very moment they came into contact with light profound energy, both of them instantly started burning up like a lit candle. It must be very painful, huh.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Light profound energy and darkness profound energy were in direct opposition to each other, but a normal person who possessed darkness profound energy would not be pushed to this extent by pure light profound energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Three Yama Ancestors were different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because their vitality and soul force had become connected to the dark yin energy in this place over the last eight hundred thousand odd years. They were now completely reliant on the dark yin energy for their continued existence; their bones, flesh, and blood had assimilated with it. They had completely and utterly become beings of darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment they transformed into pure creatures of darkness, light then became the most frightening existence to them, something they could not come into contact with at any cost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, it was not completely impossible for the Three Yama Ancestors to leave the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness. Chi Wuyao had also said that they could leave this place for about an hour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they never seemed to step outside. Because even the natural light outside of their “tomb”, which was already incredibly dim, would cause them to feel pain and discomfort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the light shining from Yun Che’s body was the sacred profound light that could only be released by light profound energy! When it fell on the bodies of the Three Yama Ancestors, they felt as if thousands of blades were piercing their bodies, as if thousands of needles were stabbing into their souls...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No, having one’s life force and soul devoured was an entirely different concept from having one’s body destroyed. The pain of such devouring could not be described, and it could not be overcome simply by willpower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You’er fell into a deep slumber as Hong’er woke up and the Heaven Smiting Devil Emperor Sword in Yun Che’s hand was transformed into the Heaven Smiting Devil Slayer Sword. The sacred profound light spread from Yun Che’s body to the body of the sword as it pierced toward Yan Wanchi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ssss-aaaaaaaaaahhhhh———”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Wanchi’s body was far too strong so Yun Che’s casual thrust naturally could not run him through and only the tip of the sword pierced his flesh. However, the Heaven Smiting power of the sword had merged with the light profound energy coming from Yun Che’s body, so this tiny wound elicited a wail of misery from Yan Wanchi that was far more shrill than the wailing of ten thousand ghosts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This extreme pain provoked a furious response from Yan Wanchi, a reaction borne out of pure despair. He flipped backwards through the air before ruthlessly thrusting a clawed hand at Yun Che’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, Yan Wanchi felt as if his body and soul had been bathed in lava that came from the depths of purgatory. Under the suppression of that holy light and the pain which transcended the realm of willpower, his spasming arm could not even produce one-tenth of his normal power. However, it still blasted Yun Che far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s body flew explosively through the air. But the moment he regained his balance, he shot back toward Yan Wanchi like a bolt of lightning. He used his light profound energy to perform the Heavenly Wolf’s fourth sword form, “Instantaneous Hell Calamity”, and his sword swiftly shot toward Yan Wanchi, who had sunk to the ground limply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His streaking sword shattered the space around it as it drove through Yan Wanchi’s body like it was a plank of rotten wood. It pierced through his right breast and exited the left side of his back, completely transfixing the body of this Yama Ancestor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sssss… Arghhhhh… Uwaaaaahhhh!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Light profound energy exploded from within his body and it was undoubtedly equivalent to creating a hell right inside of him. Yan Wanchi’s hoarse scream ripped his throat apart as his profound energy wildly erupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A miserable scream echoed amid the thunderous explosion. Yun Che’s body was blasted hundreds of meters away but the Heaven Smiting Devil Slayer Sword remained firmly lodged in Yan Wanchi’s body. The flesh and bone surrounding the sword was swiftly being destroyed, causing an expanding hole to appear in his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he wailed desperately, Yan Wanchi smashed a palm against his chest, violently dislodging the Heaven Smiting Devil Slayer Sword that was stuck in his body. However, Yun Che’s figure suddenly appeared in front of him. The Heaven Smiting Devil Slayer Sword was sucked into his hands as he unleashed another brutal “Instantaneous Hell Calamity” against Yan Wanchi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, his sword thrust into Yan Wanchi’s left breast and exited from his right shoulder blade. Another gaping hole created by the destructive power of light appeared in Yan Wanchi’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Wanchi’s screams were so shrill that even the cruelest person in the world would find them hard to listen to. He had lived for more than eight hundred thousand years but the accumulated pain he had experienced over his entire lifetime couldn’t compare to the pain he was experiencing in this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His profound energy did not obstruct any of Yun Che’s attacks. It was released in an incredibly haphazard manner and it could not suppress the light or blast Yun Che away. Finally...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His knees heavily fell to the ground and blood sprayed from his mouth as he screamed with the last bits of his consciousness, “Old ghosts… save… me… Save me… Arghhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His despairing roar elicited an immediate response. Yan Wanhun and Yan Wangui, who had both fled into the distance, suddenly turned around and unleashed Yama Ghost Hands toward Yun Che. These Yama Ghost Hands streaked through the air as they tried to grab Yun Che’s head.</span></p>

He suddenly swiveled around and he swept his sword through the air, a gigantic sword formation swiftly forming around him.</span></p>

As a result, once this rain of radiant sword beams fell upon them, their bodies were being mercilessly sliced and pierced by them. Each sword even left behind a scar of light which continued to gnaw at their souls and vitality.</span></p>

It started to undo the devastation that the light profound energy had wreaked on their bodies, life force and souls. Their flesh and bones were regenerating at an astonishing pace and Yun Che could even see their limbs growing back right in front of him. Even though their recovery speed was not as freakish as Yun Che’s, it was still shocking enough to astound the entire universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once around eighty percent of their bodies and minds had been restored, Yan Wanchi was the first to get to his feet. But his body and soul still continued to shudder in an incredibly violent fashion. The hell of light that he had just experienced was enough to haunt his dreams for the rest of his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… you… just who are…” He pointed at Yun Che as he stumbled backwards involuntarily.

However, they no longer looked at Yun Che as if he was merely a “little brat” anymore. Instead, it was as if they were looking at a vicious and cruel demon who had climbed out of hell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It looks like you’ve more or less recovered,” Yun Che said with a quiet laugh.

Completely hoarse and warped cries of pain rang out in the air as the light began to gnaw away at their vitality and souls once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, they no longer cared about anything else.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A black light flickered in his eyes.</span></p>

Before any of the Three Yama Ancestors could escape the area enshrouded in light, they had already been smashed backwards by huge tides of darkness. The impact had been so great that they had been pushed all the way back to where Yun Che was standing… which also happened to be the center of all of this light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their wails instantly grew several times more miserable. Even though they were right next to Yun Che’s feet, their wills had collapsed so completely that they could not even muster the slightest willpower to resist. They still tried their best to flee the area. They would do anything to escape this purgatory of light, a purgatory that was far too cruel for them to endure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, every time they tried to escape, they would be forcefully pushed back by a storm of darkness that they had no way of resisting. They had tried multiple times, but they never managed to escape from this hellish light for even a single instant. Most of their flesh had already been consumed by this light and their arms and legs had started disappearing again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pain of having their soul destroyed bit by bit was like being plunged into a hell within a hell!</span></p>

They used the very last shred of consciousness and will to beg Yun Che for their lives desperately.</span></p>

However, the sacred profound light that radiated from his body did not weaken one bit. “Does this mean that you finally know who your master is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We are willing… Arghhhhh… are willing to accept you as our master… Uwaaaah… Spare me… Spare me… Arghhhhh…”</span></p>

They gasped violently for breath and every drop of blood, every strand of hair on their bodies, continued to shudder and spasm uncontrollably. Murky liquid had also soaked the front of their pants and formed a large puddle beneath them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s gaze swept across them before settling on the leader of the Three Yama Ancestors, Yan Wanchi. He walked toward Yan Wanchi and stopped right in front of him. As he stared at Yan Wanchi’s miserable and sorry figure, he slowly extended a hand towards the top of his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wha… What are you going to do?” Yan Wanchi asked in a feeble voice.</span></p>
