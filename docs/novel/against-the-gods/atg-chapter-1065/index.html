His heavy consciousness instantly brightened and the eyelids he couldn’t open, no matter how hard he tried, shakily moved upwards.</span></p>

What entered his vision was a vast, withered world and a scene that belonged to the Primordial Profound Ark’s internal space. Yun Che’s eyes swept around rapidly before they became fixed on the woman next to him, in an instant.</span></p>

She was the strongest woman to ever grace Snow Song Realm and the miracle granted to Snow Song Realm by the heavens.</span></p>

Her skin was like the surface of magnificent pearls and her countenance was flawlessly beautiful. Yet, her usual fearsomeness had left her entirely. She looked so tragically beautiful that it could shatter one’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time Yun Che got to observe Mu Xuanyin so closely… and perhaps, he was also the only person who got to look straight at her from this range. Even when both her lips and her face were deathly pale, they still couldn’t hide her otherworldly beauty and icy pride that shamed all others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s eyes turned blank for an instant but he quickly recovered and crouched down on his feet, pressing a hand to her snowy white neck. His fingers trembled slightly the moment he touched her… it was because Mu Xuanyin’s body was normally ice cold because she cultivated Snow Song Realm’s greatest Ice Phoenix God Investiture Canon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, she was burning hot to his touch.</span></p>

That was why he was terrified up until this moment… but now, the stone that was crushing his heart and soul had suddenly vanished. Even the world seemed to have brightened up a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thank goodness… Phew! I was too naive. Of course someone as great as Master wouldn’t die this easily.</span></p>

At the very least, I have to keep her alive.</span></p>

The Sky Poison Pearl’s purifying powers and world spirit energy gushed into Mu Xuanyin’s body at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rrrmb...</span></p>

Yun Che hadn’t realized it until now because he was focusing all of his concentration on Mu Xuanyin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che looked up in astonishment: What’s going on? This is the world inside the Primordial Profound Ark and it’s not like it’s under siege by a spatial storm like last time. So, why…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He immediately split his consciousness to observe the world outside the Primordial Profound Ark. He was immediately shocked by what he saw.</span></p>

After he fainted, the Primordial Profound Ark must have fallen naturally from the top of the Inferno Prison straight to the bottom because his soul was no longer controlling it.</span></p>

It was the historical remains of a Primordial True God and Yun Che had every reason to believe that its heat could only be endured by a Primordial True God.</span></p>

Before Yun Che woke up, it had literally burned at the bottom of the Inferno Prison for several hours.</span></p>

He focused all of his thoughts on purifying the horned dragon’s poison in Mu Xuanyin’s body and healing her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The amount of poison in Mu Xuanyin’s body was tens of times greater than the amount Mu Bingyun had to bear with but because it had only circulated for a short time inside Mu Xuanyin’s body, it was actually easier to purify than Mu Bingyun’s poison. In just fifteen minutes, more than half of the poison was purified by the Sky Poison Pearl. The miraculous spirit energy of heaven and earth also helped stabilized her internal and external injuries, causing her life aura to grow steady and strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even after she had fully recovered, it would take a very, very long time before her near depleted profound strength and slumbering ice phoenix blood would recover. Moreover, it was said that her cultivation would decline because she had unleashed a forbidden ice phoenix formation and lost a large amount of blood essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would take some time but he could help her recover her blood essence with the power of the Rage God. He could do nothing about her decline in cultivation, however. He could only hope that Huo Rulie’s words were just false rumors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A long, long time later, the deadly poison in Mu Xuanyin’s body was finally purified in full. Yun Che exhaled loudly and sat down heavily. The true threat to Mu Xuanyin’s life was, without a doubt, the horned dragon’s poison. As long as it was completely purified, death was a difficult concept for Mu Xuanyin despite her empty reserves and severe internal injuries. Her incredibly vast cultivation foundation ensured that that was the case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally relaxing, the wakefulness that Yun Che had forcefully injected into his consciousness immediately became as thin as a thread. He was just about to close his eyes and allow himself to faint… when he abruptly opened his eyes once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wait a second. The horned dragon’s poison had been completely purified, right? So why is she still burning up?</span></p>

He immediately realized that the heat that was burning at his skin earlier almost hadn’t declined at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s… what’s going on?</span></p>

Then, she slowly opened her eyes...</span></p>

Her cheeks looked unnaturally red and her eyes were misty and distant. Her vermillion lips parted slightly and the breath exiting her mouth was unusually soft. Yun Che could sense that the breath touching his face was burning hot, however.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What… what’s this!?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che abruptly recalled something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He recalled the time he had just completed the discipleship ceremony. At the time, in order to force him to snatch Mu Feixue’s ice phoenix vital yin, Mu Xuanyin, in a fit of rage, had forcefully injected a drop of horned dragon’s blood into his body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The horned dragon’s blood was the culprit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the ancient horned dragon was knocked back by his sword and when Mu Xuanyin’s sword had pierced through the dragon fault, the sky had literally rained with dragon blood. Naturally, Mu Xuanyin and him were both covered in the dragon blood. However, he was unaffected because he was unharmed and the dragon blood didn’t enter his body. On the other hand, Mu Xuanyin was injured all over, so of course the dragon blood had entered her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, the amount of dragon blood that had entered her body should be considerable!</span></p>

Yun Che knew from experience just how scary a single drop of horned dragon blood could be, so the effects of a large amount of dragon blood was unimaginable even to him. If Mu Xuanyin was in her normal state, it would be all too easy for her to remove it. But now… even a drop of dragon blood could be fatal to her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon blood was not poison, so the Sky Poison Pearl couldn’t cleanse it from her veins. It was also impossible for him to remove it with his profound energy or he wouldn’t have forced himself into that miserable state that day. Thus, the only way to cure the dragon blood was...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“~！@#￥%…” The second the thought flashed through Yun Che’s mind, cold sweat broke out on his head and his heart came to a sudden stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That dreamy whimper that entered Yun Che’s ears was like the inviting moan of a witch. It instantly made Yun Che feel like his soul and his bones were melting inside his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While feeling utterly confused, he stared blankly at the beautiful hand being raised up and behind his neck. Her arm felt very soft and completely powerless and her eyes were misty and completely unfocused. As the horned dragon blood rampaged inside her body, she was instinctively, uncontrollably, and unconsciously seeking out Yun Che’s manly scent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s heart began to beat several times faster than usual… no… I can’t… she’s my master… she’s the Great Realm King of the Snow Song Realm… If I did it...</span></p>

If Mu Bingyun hadn’t arrived in time, he might very well be dead already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If that was already the consequence of touching her body, then… even if the reason he did it was to cure the dragon blood in her body, she would still tear him into countless pieces and no one could save him this time!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still… if he didn’t cure the dragon blood now, he had no doubt in his mind that she would die in her current state!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What should I do… what should I do!?</span></p>

At this point her warm body was almost sticking entirely against his and although she was currently as weak as a kitten, the horned dragon blood drove her body to move here and there like a water snake. Her lips opened and close repeatedly as wet, warm air that smelled like flowers was exhaled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moans that sounded like lovely, dreamy murmurs instantly sucked away every last drop of moisture in Yun Che’s mouth. Lust raged inside his body and he abruptly clenched his teeth and roared in his head: I can’t, I absolutely can’t...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He abruptly tipped his head downward in order to avoid Mu Xuanyin’s unfocused eyes. However, it resulted in his gaze invading her half torn clothes, slipping down to her jade-smooth collarbones, onto a pair of trembling, well-shaped mounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s eyes were instantly spellbound as the raging heat in his body climbed near its boiling point. Then, determination slowly settled into his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">My life or Master’s life… well, of course my master’s life is more important than mine!</span></p>

He grabbed Mu Xuanyin’s snow white clothes with both hands and tore them apart in one move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rip. In that instant, when the gorgeous, alluring sight that Yun Che had only dared to dream about in his head presented itself clearly before his eyes, every drop of blood in his body nearly rushed into his head. Yun Che’s eyes turned into saucers, his ability to think departed his brain entirely as his body temperature closely rivaled Mu Xuanyin’s.</span></p>

He should be handling the unconscious Mu Xuanyin—whose body felt softer than a common girl—with incredible care… but when thought actually translated into action, he was a beast completely out of control.</span></p>
