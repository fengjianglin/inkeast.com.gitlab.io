It was a power so dreadful that it seemed like it could devour the void itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he shot through the space which had been drained of all light, Yan Two’s devilish claws exploded toward the four remaining Sea Gods of the Southern Sea God Realm. He traveled at a breakneck speed and the four mighty Sea Gods barely had any time to react to his soul-piercing devilish might. All of them attacked him in a flustered panic, causing four intermingled beams of Southern Sea divine power to explode against the onrushing darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The intense golden light which had erupted from their bodies was instantly ripped to shreds by Yan Two’s power. The four Sea Gods shuddered violently, blood gushing out of their mouths as the golden light shining in their eyes dulled considerably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four surviving Sea Gods were strong! They were a group that was composed of two level nine Divine Masters and two level eight Divine Masters, but a single blow from Yan Two had shown them the stark disparity in strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they finally got a chance to put their strength against a Yama Ancestor, the immense gulf in strength scared the wits out of them. His strength was far beyond what they had imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hee!” Yan Two let out a bizarre chortle as his Yama Devil Claw rent the air and sent the Sea Gods flying before they had even recovered from their shock. He rushed forward and millions of dark energy blades exploded out of his withered fingers and formed a nightmarish web of energy that seemed to come from a hellish abyss. It hurtled toward the last four Sea Gods of the Southern Sea God Realm, and it looked as if this net was going to drag them into an abyss of darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yan Two, take Nan Qianqiu alive.” Yun Che’s calm voice echoed in Yan Two’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Two nodded his head in acknowledgement and his power, which had been about to engulf all four Sea Gods, suddenly twisted and swept toward Nan Qianqiu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Three’s twisted figure ghosted in front of the Southern Sea God Emperor at this exact moment, a devilish claw of darkness sweeping at his head with a soul-shattering cold light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Descendant of the Southern Sea, die! JIEHA!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was rare for Nan Wansheng to take action personally these days. If anything truly did happen, the Four Sea Kings would simply eliminate the threat with a flick of their fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now the Four Sea Kings were dead and the remaining Sea Gods could not even handle their own opponent right now. He had never imagined that he, the strongest god emperor in the Southern Divine Region, would ever be this “alone”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rage and resentment which threatened to shatter his body had finally found an outlet. The remaining hair on his head stood on end as a piercing and pure golden light shone from his eyes. The wrathful power of the Southern Sea God Emperor soon coalesced into a gigantic golden profound formation that threatened to shatter Yan Three’s darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Riiiip!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The space fifty kilometers around them seemed to sink and twist as Yan Three’s claws of darkness shattered together with that golden profound formation. Yan Three was sent hurtling through the air while Nan Wansheng’s body sagged a little. Blood burst out of the wounds that peppered his body, but Yan Three’s ghastly face appeared in his vision before he could even catch his breath. A screeching ghostly laughter echoed all around him as the Yama Ancestor rushed in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“JIEHAHAHAHA!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOOM——</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if Nan Wansheng had been swept up in an apocalyptic storm; even his mind went completely blank in that instant. He managed to force himself to a stop, but he started to wildly vomit blood just as he was about to gather more power in his body. There were five more bloody holes in his chest and each of them had started leaking pitch-black blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In terms of overall strength, Nan Wansheng was slightly stronger than Yan Three, the weakest of the Three Yama Ancestors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Nan Wansheng had already been heavily injured by the Titanic Sea God Cannon, and his blood and energy were raging about in complete chaos due to the immense anger that burned in his heart. He was not a match for Yan Three in his current state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His injuries were so bad that even defending against Yan Three’s attacks with all of his strength would cause them to rapidly worsen. At this point, he could forget about even trying to fight the Yama Ancestor. These injuries had been inflicted by the Titanic Sea God Cannon itself. It would take dozens of years for him to fully heal them, if he had the luxury of entering isolated cultivation immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As such, it came to no surprise that Nan Wansheng was rapidly retreating under Yan Three’s attacks. Unfortunately for the Southern Sea God Emperor, no one stepped in to even give him a chance to catch his breath. The four Sea Gods were being completely suppressed by Yan Two, and Nan Guizhong had not moved from his original spot yet. This was because he was currently facing an opponent that would brook no carelessness from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Bingzhu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Bingzhu.” Nan Guizhong’s expression was still as calm as it had been before, but the luster in his old eyes had dimmed dramatically. “It’s been many a year since we last met. Perhaps it’s not so bad that we are able to spar once again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Bingzhu replied, “Sparring with an old friend is always a happy occasion. Unfortunately for us, what we are about to engage in today is a battle to the death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Storm winds surged as Qianye Wugu appeared beside Qianye Bingzhu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two great Brahma Ancestors, the previous rulers of the Brahma Monarch God Realm, had unleashed their auras and they were so mighty that they caused the blood of the powerful Nan Guizhong to freeze for an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He glanced at the four Sea Gods and Nan Wansheng, quickly assessing the situation. After that, he let out a long sigh and an ancient sword made of dark gold appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was extremely confident that he would not lose to either Qianye Bingzhu or Qianye Wugu in a one-on-one duel. However, he did not have a snowball’s chance in hell of winning a fight against the two of them combined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Release all the seals on the capital!” As he raised his ancient sword high in the air, Nan Guizhong’s voice rolled through the entire Southern Sea God Realm like a vast wave. “Sons and daughters of the Southern Sea, devils have descended upon our capital and our very existence is at stake. Pick up your arms, scions of the Southern Sea. Burn up your lives and fight!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of the seals layered around the Southern Sea’s capital city had been blasted to bits by the Titanic Sea God Cannon, but Nan Guizhong’s command had released the rest of them.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We must move now!” The Xuanyuan God Emperor’s body trembled as more than a million rays of sword energy converged around his body. “It will be too late to do anything if we don’t act now…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he could finish speaking, he suddenly jerked his head up to look at the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked as if a hole had been torn into the boundless black sky. The aura… of another level ten Divine Master started to leak from that hole!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless eyes shot toward that wound in the sky. They could sense the aura of a god emperor radiating from that dark hole, but the person who emerged from it made everyone gasp in disbelief. It was a figure that seemed far too small and delicate for the power it contained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“T-that’s!?” Shocked cries rang out all over the place, because the person who had come possessed a mighty name, one that all who lived in the God Realm recognized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er froze in her tracks and turned towards the girl who had suddenly appeared, her eyes filled with consternation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che slowly lifted his head and a strange light started shining in his pitch-black eyes. He whispered a single name in the softest of voices, “Cai…zhi…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A level ten… Divine Master!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her progress had actually… been this bizarre!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Urgh… The Heavenly Wolf… Star God!” Nan Wansheng’s body violently swayed. When the aura of another level ten Divine Master had appeared, he had prayed for a savior. However, the only thing that awaited him was a cruel nightmare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she floated in the air high above them, Caizhi’s face was impassive. There was nearly no emotion in those eyes of hers as she stared down at the world below her. She slowly raised the transformed Heavenly Wolf Sacred Sword in the air and pointed it straight toward the heavens above.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Riiip!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of a wolf shone above the tip of her sword, but the light it emitted was not the azure profound light of the Heavenly Wolf’s divine power. It was instead a bizarre black light that was slowly being tinged… crimson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...!?” Yun Che narrowed his eyebrows in consternation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This red light...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the red light started to spread and disperse into the air, it formed a gigantic independent space around Caizhi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">ROOOOOOOOOOAAAAR——————</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A soul-shaking roar rang out of that bizarre independent space, and everyone presently instantly recognized that it was a dragon’s roar. It was the mighty roar of a dragon that no living being could match!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the roar reverberated in their ears, the huge figure of a dragon broke through space and appeared in the skies above them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dragon was long and vast and its body was the color of ash. It was a color that spoke of a long-lost primordial age, the passage of countless years. Shockingly enough, the draconic might that radiated from its body showed that it was a mid-stage Divine Master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though this bizarre and sudden change had quieted the battlefield, the appearance of this dragon was just the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before anyone had even recovered from their shock, a second draconic figure had appeared. It looked just as vast and ancient as the first one and it also exuded the incredibly heavy aura of a Divine Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, a third and fourth dragon appeared… but that number soon turned into ten… twenty… fifty… a hundred!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These incredibly rare Divine Master dragons had surged out of that strange hole in the sky right before everyone’s eyes. As they spread their wings, they blotted out the sun and covered up the sky. The aura of these hundred Divine Master dragons was so dense and heavy that even the tiniest grain of sand had frozen under its might.</span></p>
