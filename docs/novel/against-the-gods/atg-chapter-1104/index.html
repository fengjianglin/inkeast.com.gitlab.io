Since that was the case, Lei Qianfeng voluntarily increased it by five times its amount using the price of the three Black Feather Merchant Guild’s men’s lives as reference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he never expected that this Poison Saint Blackheart would ask for one hundred million!!</span></p>

This was exactly a hundred times more than the three Black Feather Merchant Guild members!!</span></p>

However, to him, one hundred million profound stones was still not a small number. Furthermore, he had six sons, bringing the total up to six hundred million profound stones!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Qianfeng twitched all over, starting from the corner of his mouth all the way to the back of his neck. However, the awesomeness of this Poison Saint Blackheart naturally made him unable to flare up. He said with a bitter face, “Senior Poison Saint, the lives of my sons are naturally priceless and this humble one is absolutely not a stingy person but pricing the detoxifying spirit pellets at one hundred million profound stones per pellet is indeed a bit...is it possible for this senior make a small exception?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exception? Heh…” The black clad old man laughed coldly. “Darkya Realm King, this old man is well aware of whether or not you are able to take out six hundred million profound stones. You dare haggle with me? Hehehehe, I’m afraid that you haven’t heard of the blackheart in my name enough times.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black clad old man’s words utterly discomforted Lei Qianfeng as an indescribable unease surfaced in his heart. Just as he was about to say something, Lei Tiangang’s voice suddenly came over, “Sect Master, we’re still missing one!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Qianfeng abruptly turned around. “What do you mean by missing one…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as the words left his mouth, he suddenly came to his senses… The total number of detoxifying pellets Poison Saint Blackheart threw over to him previously just happened to total six. However, due to his own cautiousness, he gave the first pellet to the Soul Sect disciple infected with the Thousand Souls Poison. The remaining amount he had quickly given to Lei Tiangang and Lei Qiandu only totaled five.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his excitement and worry earlier, he had actually neglected this fact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The poison auras of the five that had been given the antidote faded; their complexions became rosy and they no longer looked pained. Seeing his brothers break free of the toxin, the anxious struggle of the one remaining became more violent. Lei Qiangang’s shout had then increased the intensity of his struggling even more. “Royal father… Mother… quick… save me…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one which had yet to be detoxified… was astonishingly Lei Guangqian! The only son left between Lei Qianfeng and Xiao Qingtong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qian’er!” Xiao Qingtong cried painfully. Then, she yelled in a rage, “You two, why didn’t you give the antidote to Qian’er first!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This…” Lei Tiangang answered in terror, “Calm your anger, Madam. I thought that the Great Elder also had three but who knew…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Xiao Qingtong was about to pounce over, she immediately came to her senses and looked toward Poison Saint Blackheart. She asked anxiously, “Senior Poison Saint, my husband is naturally a suspicious one so he wasted a pellet. May you bestow us another one?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!” A low snort sounded, causing the souls of everyone present to freeze. “There are many who doubt my abilities so I would never take that to heart. However… after I gave you the antidote and your sons were saved, you actually have the face to dare haggle over the price. Since the lives of your sons are that cheap, one or two dying should be alright with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black clad old man’s voice was several times colder than before; it was obvious that he had been truly angered… Lei Qianfeng trying to haggle with him clearly touched some kind of taboo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Qianfeng’s expression changed yet again as sobbing sounds surfaced in Xiao Qingtong’s pleas, “Senior Poison Saint, my husband doesn’t understand how to appreciate favors and has offended you but this is absolutely not my intention. I have said it myself earlier, as long as you can save them, I would not hesitate to pay any price.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Qianfeng flapped his lips, embarrassment all over his face. “Senior…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut up!” The moment Lei Qianfeng said something, the rest of his words had been furiously stuffed back in his mouth. She quickly took out an amethyst spatial ring and said, “Senior Poison Saint, I am willing to give you seven hundred million profound stones for seven pellets right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black clad old man’s gaze swept over, the coldness in his eyes scattered. “Hehehe, no need. I am never afraid of anyone owing me, because the ones that dare to not pay up are all dead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Happiness surfaced on Xiao Qingtong’s face. “Does this mean that Senior Poison Saint is willing to give us another pellet? Senior Poison Saint, thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black clad old man slowly took out a dirty, black colored wooden case from somewhere and placed it on the table to his right. When he opened the case, pellets of different colors and sizes filled the interior. Nearly half of them were the antidotes he tossed out previously. One could see that there were at least fifty of them at a single glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The instant the wooden case opened, an irresistible attractive force led the gazes of everyone present to lock onto a certain pellet at its center. It was the biggest pellet inside the box, as large as a dragon eye fruit. While all the other pellets within the case were all a dark color, yet it was a bright scarlet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, what attracted their attention was obviously not its appearance but its distinct spiritual energy which was incredibly mysterious and mystical. Just gazing at it made them clearly feel a sense of clarity which penetrated their souls. It instantly cleared their minds and even their gazes became distinctively clearer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kind of aura was simply unheard of and this kind of feeling was indescribable. They had never experienced such before in their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many pellets within the wooden case yet this scarlet pellet’s spiritual energy actually suppressed all the others. They had personally seen with their own eyes what kind of result came out of the most common pellet among them, so this scarlet pellet… was undoubtedly an extremely high grade one. It could be said to be a rare treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath their odd gazes, the black clad old man slowly took out a pellet and leisurely said, “As long as the price is appropriate, there is no reason for me to not do business. However, the price of this one is different from the previous six.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He extended his withered hand but had not yet closed the black colored wooden case, allowing the unique spiritual energy to escape. “This one costs three hundred million profound stones.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What!? Th-three hundred million?” Lei Qianfeng roared, his eyeballs nearly coming out of his sockets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” The eyes of the black clad old man narrowed. “It looks like the Darkya Realm King still isn’t satisfied with my pricing. Then… how about five hundred million profound stones?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Both of Lei Qianfeng’s legs went soft as he said panicky, “No, n-no… three hundred million, three hundred million!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t listen to him!” Xiao Qingtong fiercely glared at Lei Qianfeng and answered with an incomparable firmness, “Since Senior Poison Saint said five hundred million profound stones, then it’ll be five hundred million profound stones! If it is for my son’s life, forget about the five hundred million profound stones senior proposed, even if it is a billion profound stones, it would still be a great favor!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When her voice fell, she flipped her hand. The amethyst ring flashed and then it was pushed toward the black clad old man. “There are a total of eleven hundred million profound stones inside. Please check and accept it, Senior Poison Saint.”</span></p>

Both Lei Qiandu and Lei Tiangang lamented in their hearts. Accustomed to covering the entire Darkya Realm with a single hand, their sect master was eternally tyrannical and arrogant, especially in these recent years where he became more easily irritable as the years went by. As for imposingness and how to properly respond to different people, especially “experts”, the sect mistress far surpassed their sect master.</span></p>

Without even bothering to inspect the number of profound stones inside the amethyst ring, he leisurely put it away after retrieving it. Then, he gently flicked the antidote in his hand while praising, “Darkya Realm King, even though you are not worthy of much respect, you have however, married a great wife. What a pity, what a pity.”</span></p>

A result identical to what happened with the previous five appeared; before ten breaths of time had yet to pass, the poison aura on Lei Guangqian dispersed and he no longer let out pained moans.</span></p>

I had never felt such a power before. Since it comes from Senior Poison Saint, I would assume that it is an extraordinary object. Senior Poison Saint, can you teach me a thing or two and broaden my horizons?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” The black clad elder slightly narrowed his eyes. “This pellet is called the Scarlet Immortal Spirit Pellet. Refined using several thousand different kinds of poisonous insects and spirit plants, it is able to cleanse all things under heaven and detoxify myriad poisons.”</span></p>

Just picking it up instantly made the scattering of the spiritual energy within increase several fold, stunning Lei Qianfeng and the rest as their amazement increased even further.</span></p>

After it is completely refined, those below the Divine Sovereign Realm will rarely encounter any bottlenecks and one’s body will never be infiltrated by myriad poisons within three thousand years of consumption!”</span></p>

Lei Qianfeng’s gaze grew taut as his throat continuously wiggled. Upon seeing Lei Qianfeng’s reaction, Xiao Qingtong promptly asked, “Is senior willing to sell such a miraculous pellet?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehehe…” the black clad old man cackled. “Since it was up for display, it is obviously up for sale.

I’m afraid a little lower star sect like yours cannot afford it.”</span></p>

Senior, please quote a price. Being able to encounter senior and such a divine pellet may yet be a kind of heaven bestowed fate. How can I be willing to miss such an opportunity?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well said!” The black clad old man turned around, still holding onto the Scarlet Immortal Spirit Pellet. “Little girly, your temperament is truly impeccable. I like it. I was originally going to sell it to those old freaks in the middle star realms but since a little girly like you asked, I’ll give you this one chance… heh… Whether or not this is fated depends on the thickness of your family’s wealth.”</span></p>

She answered with almost no hesitation at all, “Five billion profound stones is truly expensive. However, it is absolutely worth losing one’s entire fortune for such a divine pellet. Alright… Senior Poison Saint, I will buy this spirit pellet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lei Qianfeng abruptly turned his head in her direction but he didn’t voice any words of dissent.

This brat has cultivated lightning attribute profound arts for several thousand years but still managed to harm himself. He ought to have used all sorts of spirit medicine and stones to support himself for quite a few years, yet in the end… Hehehehe, I’m afraid it has been several tens of years since he was able to copulate.”</span></p>

The coldness felt within the room as well as the heart thumping eerie feeling came from the combination of darkness profound energy and ice profound energy. Not daring to stay any longer, he randomly changed into a set of clothes before quickly fleeing in the direction opposite Lei Qianfeng and his party.</span></p>

From the spreading of the Poison Saint Backheart news, to killing Lei Guangmo by poison, to poisoning his six other sons, to forcing Lei Qianfeng to find Poison Saint Blackheart. All that was to make him swallow the Scarlet Immortal Spirit Pellet!</span></p>

Lei Qianfeng was obviously attracted to it and desired it but he had not acted. Fortunately, Xiao Qingtong gave him a perfect supportive attack… Furthermore, regardless if it was the “antidote” or the “Scarlet Immortal Spirit Pellet”, they paid a huge amount of profound stones. All of that was provided by Xiao Qingtong and not Lei Qianfeng.</span></p>

At the very least, she was in control of Soul Sect’s economic funds?</span></p>

Otherwise, its poison aura would easily be exposed. As such, if Lei Qianfeng used all his strength to dispel the poison, there was a huge probability that he wouldn’t die from the poison.</span></p>
