Its bloodstained body went stiff in midair and the last bit of its despairing power quickly collapsed and dispersed, as if it had met the onslaught of a gale…</span></p>

Under the stun effect of the Dragon Soul, it had lost all its remaining power. When the icy rays of light came into contact with it, its huge body couldn’t put up any resistance at all and ended up acting as a medium to let the cold and condensing power play out its role. In the blink of an eye, its entire body got covered in a layer of ice.</span></p>

With the last of her energy released outside, her long hair turned completely black and there was not the slightest bit of cold energy present on her body… On the contrary, a scorching aura, that she had never possessed in these ten thousand years, was emitting from her at the moment.</span></p>

Suffering from highly toxic poison, bearing severe injuries, and complete exhaustion of her profound strength… As the life force of the ancient horned dragon perished, her vague consciousness speedily sank into darkness.</span></p>

However, his eyes suddenly opened, as if he had been pricked by multiple needles simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt a soft arm moving away from his body. Within his hazy line of sight, he saw a snow-white figure, that was mostly dyed in the red color of blood, falling downward without a sound…</span></p>

Afterwards, he tightly embraced the figure… Its aura was frail to such an extent that one would feel extreme sorrow at its state, but it unexpectedly helped in properly stabilizing his dissociating soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then caught sight of a huge frozen figure in the distance that was falling straight down.</span></p>

He used his barely existing consciousness to prompt his body to move and flew down in the hazy and disordered world, heading in the direction of the huge figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is the fruit of the effort Master has put in, even at the risk of her life… I absolutely can’t have it disappear in the God Burying Inferno Prison like the one from before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though his consciousness was on the brink of collapse, he still had his profound strength. With his blurred vision fixed on it, he quickly approached the ancient horned dragon. Then, he stretched out his hand and placed it on its body, instantly storing it into the Sky Poison Pearl.</span></p>

Carrying Mu Xuanyin along, he fell downward toward the endless Inferno Prison.</span></p>

It was impossible for it to get damaged even by the power of a Divine Master. Yun Che did his utmost to gather enough soul energy to enter the Primordial Profound Ark…</span></p>

A white streak of light flashed before both Yun Che and Mu Xuanyin disappeared from the vast Inferno Prison.</span></p>

He was unable to see a thing and his five senses had grown weaker to such an extent that there was barely any difference between them existing or not. He was aware that he had gotten inside the Primordial Profound Ark and vaguely sensed the presence of Mu Xuanyin beside him. Having succeeded in his attempt, his mind relaxed and he passed out in no time.</span></p>

It fell straight into the vast Inferno Prison and disappeared in the blink of an eye, without leaving a trace behind</span></p>

But given the vastness of the Inferno Prison, he was unable to discover any sign of them or sense their auras.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“W-what happened?” Huo Rulie’s gaze swept over the surroundings, with a bewildered and anxious look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he had brought Yun Che to three hundred kilometers away from the center of the battle, he had turned around to leave hastily, as Yun Che had told him to at the time. However, the instant he had turned around, he heard a blood-curdling screech of the ancient horned dragon. A burst of remnant energy waves swept in all directions and he was forced nearly a hundred kilometers away from the place. Soon after, he heard a dragon roar once again, one that was clearly issued by some other being, and his ears were shaken so much that they rang for a while. By the time his aura calmed down and he came to himself, he discovered, to his surprise, that he couldn’t sense any aura in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He promptly dashed to his previous location but didn’t see any traces of Mu Xuanyin, Yun Che… or even the ancient horned dragon. The only things present were the still existing remnants of the energy and the extremely dense smell of dragon blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t tell me that… both of them died?” Huo Rulie said in disbelief of his own words. He looked downward, before frowning and rushing into the God Burying Inferno Prison all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Rulie didn’t give up on the search for them inside the Inferno Prison, wishfully hoping to be able to find something in the end. He made his way deep down into the Inferno Prison, as far as his abilities would permit and also traversed the distance of several hundred kilometers horizontally. Unfortunately, it was all for naught.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he eventually dropped the idea of looking for them and came out of the Inferno Prison, he saw that Yan Wancang, Yang Juehai, as well as all the high level elders had also arrived. Close to hundred people have been staring blankly at the abnormally calm Inferno Prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master Huo, have you found them?” Yan Wancang asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Rulie leaped up in the air while making a heavy sound with his foot and roared at them, “What is going on here? What exactly happened? I just turned around and then, both of them disappeared to some place. Can anyone tell me where Young Yun went?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That ancient horned dragon… died,” Yan Juehai replied in quite a hesitant tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How did it die?”</span></p>

Every time he recalled the scene of Yun Che blowing away the ancient horned dragon with his sword, he would feel his soul quaking intensely. He never thought that there would come a day when someone like him, who was a peak level existence in the Flame God Realm, with respect to both standing and profound strength, would be shocked by a junior who had recently entered into the Divine Way.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Juehai shook his head as soon as he finished his words.</span></p>

Mu Xuanyin had used up her remaining strength to launch that attack with Snow Princess Sword, so she was no more able to withstand the counterattack of the ancient horned dragon… As such, there was no doubt that both the master and disciple had been killed by its claws, after which all the lifeforce drained from the ancient horned dragon. Afterwards, the bodies of the two people and the dragon fell down into the God Burying Inferno Prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first ancient horned dragon had already gotten killed by Mu Xuanyin’s forbidden formation and buried in the God Burying Inferno Prison and the second one also ended up meeting the same end…</span></p>

It seems that they have fallen down to a very deep place inside the Inferno Prison and their bodies will entirely disappear in a short while.”</span></p>

However, not only did they not obtain even a single dragon scale from them, they also had to witness the death of Mu Xuanyin, Realm King of the Snow Song Ream, and her direct disciple, Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m afraid that the incident this time will make us the mortal enemies of the Snow Song Realm,” a Vermilion Bird Sect Elder said as he smiled bitterly.</span></p>

Given her standing and reputation in the Snow Song Realm, it went without saying that if the Divine Ice Phoenix Sect were to know of her death, they would be extremely grieved and enraged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This matter didn’t only involve Mu Xuanyin… If Yun Che was all right, with his talent in elements, it was extremely likely for someone as strong as Mu Xuanyin to appear in the Snow Song Realm, under the full-blown support of the Divine Ice Phoenix Sect but now, even Yun Che had…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the dream of their Flame God Realm had fallen through, they hadn’t sufferer the slightest actual loss on their side.</span></p>

If back then… we had so much as contacted her with sound transmission to warn her in advance, we could have avoided such an outcome. Hah…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Wancang, "…”</span></p>

Who would have… believed those words at the time?” the Phoenix Sect Elder justified in a diffident tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I feel that there is no need to be worry over it,” a Golden Crow Sect Elder said. “Without Mu Xuanyin, the Snow Song Realm basically doesn’t deserve to be placed on par with our Flame God Realm. They might not even have the guts to call us to account for it. If anyone truly dares to ask for an explanation, we’ll just shoo them away back to their realm. Although we failed to get our hands on the horned dragon, Mu Xuanyin’s death is absolutely not a bad thing for us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nonsense!!” Hearing his words, Huo Rulie raised his brows in anger. “When did we of the Flame God Realm stoop down to the level of those base and shameless people!? No matter what resentments we harbored against them earlier, it is a fact that she came here and died because of us. Hence, we must give a proper explanation to the Snow Song Realm! I, Huo Rulie, still have a sense of shame!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes… it was a slip of tongue of this old man.” the Golden Crow Sect Elder immediately lowered his head, as he muttered in his heart: Sect Master hated the Snow Song Realm before… and especially hated Mu Xuanyin with a passion. How come he seems to have changed in these two days?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The fall of a Divine Master is major matter for the entire God Realm. Therefore, it won’t take long for the news to spread around,” Yan Wancang said. “If we don’t give an explanation to the Snow Song Realm, we will possibly be looked upon with contempt by all the realms of the Divine Region.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sect Master, what should we do now? Do you want to… contact the Snow Song Realm with sound transmission, at once?” a Vermilion Bird Sect Elder asked while sighing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Wancang pondered for a good long while, before shaking his head, “Let’s keep what happened today a secret for the time being. After coming up with a good response to the anger of the Snow Song Realm over the next few days, we will then let them know about it through sound transmission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Juehai nodded his head and Huo Rulie didn’t object to it, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These topmost people of the Flame God Realm left the God Burying Inferno Prison with incomparably complicated emotions in their hearts. When he came out of the Inferno Prison region, Yan Wancang suddenly stopped in his tracks and sighed heavily, “No wonder the Dragon God Realm can become the sovereign of all realms. It’s better… to not provoke the anger of the dragon race.”</span></p>
