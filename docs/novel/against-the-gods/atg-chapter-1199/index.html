I’ll be careful.” Yun Che nodded, but he didn’t actually feel much on the inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had witnessed the battle between Shui Meiyin and Meng Duanxi with his own eyes, and he had to agree that her mental powers were extraordinary. Meng Duanxi was powerful, but he was almost completely helpless before her mental powers. If Shui Meiyin hadn’t let up in the end, he wouldn’t have even noticed that he was mind controlled past the point of defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Shui Meiyin couldn’t be underestimated, he had four types of divine souls in this body... He was at least confident that he wouldn’t lose to a little girl in terms of mental power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for profound strength… Shui Meiyin was without a doubt the weakest out of everyone present. As long as he could suppress her mental attacks, the rest of the battle should be as easy as bullying a three-year-old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Lengchuan examined Yun Che’s expression shortly before saying, “It looks like you’re pretty confident about tomorrow’s fight. That is good, of course… I still don’t think you can beat Jun Xilei as you are now, but I definitely look forward to your battle against her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Lengchuan tossed three glittering items at Yun Che after he said this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che caught them and gave them a glance. They were three Time Wheel Pearls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are useless to me now, but you… maybe a few months’ time is enough for you to create a miracle.” Lu Lengchuan smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che didn’t turn down his offer. He held the Time Wheel Pearls tightly and thanked Lu Lengchuan gratefully, “Thank you, Brother Lengchuan. I definitely need these items.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to thank me.” Lu Lengchuan turned around before speaking in a low tone. “Thank you, Brother Yun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you thanking me?” Yun Che looked confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are two reasons.” Lu Lengchuan sounded rueful when he said this, “One, you… purposely separated the two suns before you unleashed Nine Suns Heaven’s Fury, didn’t you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che looked caught off guard, but he didn’t speak up or shake his head in denial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was true that he had split the two overlapping suns right before he threw Nine Suns Heaven’s Fury. It was also true that its power was diminished as a result… he had used up all of his profound energy at the time, so he had no way of controlling the two suns once he unleashed them. It was entirely possible that a full powered Nine Suns Heaven’s Fury might kill Lu Lengchuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason he changed his mind at the last moment and did something that went completely against his own objectives was because of Lu Lengchuan’s slapping of Lu Chenyuan and the things he said the day before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I thought so.” Lu Lengchuan smiled. “You obviously want to win a lot, and yet you still hold yourself back from passing the line of cruelty and ruthlessness. You never brought this up until I asked you about it, which makes it obvious that you’re protecting my pride… despite possessing unparalleled strength and talent, you also have a good nature. The Eastern Divine Region is lucky to have a genius like you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che shook his head. “You praise me too much, Brother Lengchuan. I’m sure you can block the attack even if I hadn’t done so. Plus, I personally don’t think that my nature deserves your praise at all. I’ve done many ruthless things in the past, and about my final attack… I doubt I’ll do that again if I have to repeat myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Lengchuan smiled noncommittally before continuing, “The next thing I want to thank you for… is about the fact that I’m about to hit sixty in a couple of years. Thank you for giving me a battle like this at the end of my youth. I no longer have any regrets left in this part of my life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Lengchuan walked away, but not without giving Yun Che a few more parting words, “Feel free to visit Shrouding Sky Realm when you’re free. My father praises you a lot, and I’m sure he’ll be absolutely delighted to meet you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How many people in the entire Eastern Divine Region had the honor to be “praised a lot” by the Shrouding Sky Realm King himself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he stayed where he was, silently, for a very long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Far beneath, huh…” Yun Che hid a sigh as he recalled Lu Lengchuan’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If even the likes of Lu Lengchuan was “far beneath” Jun Xilei, then there was no way he could beat her as he was right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His only ray of hope… was the six months of extra time granted by the Time Wheel Pearls in his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I must find a way to improve my strength as much as I can in the next two days.” Yun Che muttered to himself before glancing at his left hand. “As for Hong’er… Her power is lagging behind mine already. I remember that she hasn’t finished all the swords Ji Ruyan gave me… but in the end, they are swords from lower star realms. Her power wouldn’t improve drastically even if she ate all of them. I guess I must find another way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked up into the sky and muttered absentmindedly. “Jasmine, have you seen my fight today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">--------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eternal Heaven Realm was as quiet as usual. The moment Yun Che returned to his courtyard, he immediately noticed the master and the disciple Huo Rulie and Huo Poyun. It was obvious that they were waiting for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Yun!” Huo Poyun strode towards him excitedly, “The entire Eastern Divine Region has learned that you’ve beaten Lu Lengchuan. I… I can’t believe I missed the match. I can’t even begin to tell you how regretful I’m feeling right now. Er… how are your wounds?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, they’re fine, it’s nothing,” Yun Che said casually. He felt relaxed after judging that Huo Poyun was looking a lot better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boy Yun…” Huo Rulie walked over with a chuckle. “Your opponents will only be more and more powerful from this point onwards. They are all the strongest young geniuses of the Eastern Divine Region. No one will question your current achievements, but… I’m sure that everyone of us are looking forward to you reaching even greater heights. Therefore, you must do your best in your next match… everything else can wait until after the Profound God Convention.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che nodded. “Don’t worry, Sect Master Huo. I will do my best… including Brother Poyun’s portion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Yun…” Huo Poyun shot Yun Che an emotional look. “Not only did you manage to beat Lu Lengchuan, you even helped spread the glory of our Golden Crow Sect. It should’ve been my duty… but I ultimately failed to live up to everyone’s expectations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, do you understand now, Yun’er? The Golden Crow flame isn’t weak at all, on the contrary it’s very, very powerful. There are none more deserving of the title “strongest divine flame” than the Golden Crow flame. Yun boy’s Nine Suns Heaven’s Fury especially stunned those upper star realm fellows so much that they couldn’t wipe their expressions off their faces for a very long time, hahahaha.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Rulie couldn’t control his sense of pride and passion and laughed loudly the moment he recalled the moment the world became illuminated by golden flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was definitely the most fame Golden Crow Sect had ever gotten during his lifetime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mn!” Huo Poyun nodded strongly. “Brother Yun defeated Lu Lengchuan, a God Child of the Eastern Divine Region with the Golden Crow flames. The entire Eastern Divine Region has borne witness to its power. I finally understand that my defeat at the hands of Jun Xilei isn’t because the Golden Crow flame isn’t strong enough. It’s because my cultivation is utterly lacking… To think that I had become depressed for such a ridiculous reason… I must have disappointed you greatly, master.”</span></p>

Yun’er, Yun boy was right that day. You’re just a young boy, and it’s only natural for you to feel lost sometimes. The fact that you managed to escape your depression so quickly only makes me proud and happy for your sake. Why would I ever be disappointed by this?”</span></p>

For the longest time, I thought I was strong enough to hold my own. I even thought that I was good enough to support Flame God Realm’s future already. In the end, I guess I was too young and naive. I’ll do my best to cultivate harder in the future… I’ll cultivate the Golden Crow flames hard and my mind even harder.”</span></p>

This meant that Yun Che had a total of seven Time Wheel Pearls, and could extend fourteen hours to seven months right now.</span></p>

Neither of them asked Yun Che how he came by his Golden Crow bloodline. Huo Rulie’s explanation was that he wanted Yun Che to focus fully in the next few matches… Everything else could wait until afterwards.</span></p>

Although today’s battle has dispelled his doubt about the Golden Crow flame’s strength, the defeat was a terrible shock. I guess he still needs more time before he can truly regain himself.</span></p>

When Huo Rulie returned to his accommodation, he noticed that Huo Poyun had been lowering his head and staying silent all this time.</span></p>

Are you still regretting that you missed out on Yun boy’s fight against Lu Lengchuan?” Huo Rulie smiled. “It’s okay. Someone must’ve captured that fight using a Profound Imagery Stone. You will be able to watch it.”</span></p>

Huo Rulie shook his head immediately. “Of course not. Yun’er, do you remember? The Golden Crow Divine Spirit once mentioned that there was another Golden Crow inheritance in a certain place beyond the God Realm.”</span></p>

It can only be the Golden Crow origin blood just like you.”</span></p>

He sighed. “Maybe this is the Golden Crow Divine Spirit’s guidance. Although he isn’t a Golden Crow Sect disciple, this is the first time the Golden Crow flame was glorious as this in the Eastern Divine Region. After today, all Golden Crow Sect disciples will come to respect him greatly, and the elders cann’t stop praising him for his actions. It doesn’t actually matter where he came to earn his Golden Crow bloodline now, hahahahaha…”</span></p>

Huo Poyun’s terrible defeat and depression had made him feel down for a little, but Yun Che’s fight today had opened up so many pores and made him so happy that he literally couldn’t describe his emotions. Who knew how many times he had laughed like he did today.</span></p>

His Golden Crow bloodline… must be a lot purer than mine, isn’t it.”</span></p>

This means you have the richest Golden Crow bloodline in the entire world. Yun Che…”</span></p>

Considering his cultivation level that day, it should’ve been impossible for him to block your Golden Crow flames no matter how good he was at commanding ice profound energy… the fact that he was able to resist your power while being completely unharmed proves that he has tremendous control over the power of ice and fire… a level that’s far higher than yours.”</span></p>

However, his “loss” had contributed largely to Yun Che’s victory… he could only feel pleased and lucky when he thought about this. He actually didn’t feel displeased by Mu Xuanyin’s trickery in the slightest.</span></p>

This means that Brother Yun probably hadn’t cultivated the Golden Crow’s Record of the Burning World even though he already had its bloodline. If that’s true, that means that he was able to unleash Nine Suns Heaven’s Fury… despite cultivating the Golden Crow’s Record of the Burning World for only three years…”</span></p>

Three measley years!!</span></p>

It’s only today that I realize that I’m incomparable to him in every way… actually, I should say that I’m not even qualified to be a comparison. To think I would be so foolish as to think that I’m…”</span></p>

Yun Che is an absolute monster that surprised even the god emperors. This God Conferred Battle will definitely make him famous throughout the entire God Realm, and there’s no praise that he doesn’t deserve. He’s the kind of monster that may not show up even in a hundred thousand years after all! You don’t need to compare yourself to him. You only need to know that you will always be my greatest pride.”</span></p>

Your promise gladdens me considerably, Yun’er. Mn, speaking of which, that Yun boy has the Golden Crow bloodline even though isn’t a member of our Golden Crow Sect, and now the entire Eastern Divine Region knows about it. The two of you are best friends, and I’m fond of him too, so I guess we can call him half a member of the Golden Crow Sect? To think that our Golden Crow Sect will be fortunate enough to welcome both of you into its fold. I, Huo Rulie can meet my ancestors with a smile even if I were to die right away, hahahahaha…”</span></p>

He shook his head and looked at the sky with clear regret. “My master’s praise, my peers’ admiration, and fame throughout the entire Divine Eastern Region… Brother Yun rightfully deserves all these. He even inherited my will and kept the Golden Crow flames burning on the God Conferred Stage…”</span></p>

Huo Rulie, Yan Juehai, and the elders only had endless praise for him.

All these factors had undoubtedly caused an uncontrollable spurt of jealousy inside his heart.</span></p>
