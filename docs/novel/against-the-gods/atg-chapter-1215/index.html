 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectators did not dare believe it, even though the scene had unfolded right before their eyes.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How… how is this possible…” Shui Yinghen’s mouth was agape as he muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Shui Qianheng’s eyebrows were slanted into a frown. For a long time, he didn’t say anything. This outcome was a shocker even to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Meiyin put her tiny hands on her chest and felt her heart racing at an abnormal rate. It wasn’t until a while later that some color finally returned to her cheeks. She said in a small voice, “I just knew it, nothing bad would happen to Big Brother… that’s great...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Yingyue shot Shui Meiyin a complicated look. Before this, she had thought that Shui Meiyin’s sudden infatuation with Yun Che was just a product of impulse and playfulness. It could also be the residual effect of her soul losing a battle, but that could be healed very quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However… she had never seen such level of worry, agitation, and fear in her eyes until now. There were even tears in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every sign was pointing towards Shui Meiyin falling for Yun Che for real, whatever her reason might be. At the very least, it was no temporary infatuation or simple playfulness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Yun Che’s crisis was far from over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Staring at Yun Che, Jun Xilei raised the Nameless Sword high up into the air once more. A shapeless power rose high up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Enough. This is enough already…” Jun Wuming closed his eyes. His voice had never sounded this powerless. At this point, he understood that there was no stopping Jun Xilei, especially when he had already failed earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword’s power gathered once more, prompting the very sky itself to darken. Not a trace of the cloud’s usual color could be seen, and the atmosphere felt oppressive enough to squeeze blood out of one’s lungs. Yun Che, the target of the sword, felt like his head was being suspended in between a demon’s fangs. His body shook with fear against his wishes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone could sense that this new attack was even stronger than the one before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Retreat now, Yun Che!” Huo Rulie shouted. “Nothing is more precious than your own life! You’ve already won this battle!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che had already tasted the terror that was the Nameless Sword first hand, but this second attack was going to be even deadlier than the first. Considering how badly he was wounded from the first sword blast alone… Yun Che had to know that there was no way he could endure another attack, or so Huo Rulie believed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason Yun Che hadn’t surrendered during the first attack was because he was a proud man who wasn’t aware of just how deadly the Nameless Sword was. Now that he had tasted its might with his own body, he should know what the right choice to make here was… In Huo Rulie’s opinion, Yun Che was an extremely clever person. No matter how proud he was, there was no way he would recklessly throw his life away for pride.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Yun Che didn’t take even a step backward. He ignored the Nameless Sword, extended his arm and summoned the Heaven Smiting Sword to his hand. But to everyone’s surprise, he put the weapon away instead of holding it in front of himself just like before. The fire surrounding him had also been completely extinguished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was replaced with the faint blue light of the Ice Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a long cry, and Profound Handle: God Manifestation was unleashed once more. This time, it was the Ice Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was stunned by Yun Che’s actions again… it was obvious that he was planning to endure Jun Xilei’s second strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is… is he trying to commit suicide!?” Huo Rulie’s hair stood up as he roared out in frustration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack crack crack crack crack...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blue light flashed repeatedly from both Yun Che and the Ice Phoenix Manifest God as they constructed many icy defenses between themselves and Jun Xilei. In just a few breaths, more than half of the Conferred God Stage was covered in ice mountains and frozen ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was at this moment Jun Xilei finished channeling and swung the Nameless Sword a second time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the same pose as before, the same basic sword blast. However, the instant Jun Xilei unleashed her attack, Yun Che felt as if all the blood in his body had been frozen by the sword’s overwhelming might. The terrible omen of death, that penetrated right through his heart and soul, warned Yun Che that this new attack was nearly twice as powerful as the first!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spectators’ cries were also far louder than before, but Yun Che heard not a sound, just like the last time. Everything had been devoured by that unparalleled power that didn’t belong on this stage at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che retreated as quickly as he was able as the Nameless Sword’s sword blast cut through the erected defenses. The ice shattered like it was made of rotten wood, but the blast itself barely lost any power at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every ice defense the Ice Phoenix and he had constructed were ground into dust in just an instant. The long cry of a phoenix cut through the air, and the Ice Phoenix—before anyone realized it, had grown several times larger than normal—charged straight towards the sword blast like a glittery ice beam covered in blue crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Scree!!!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword blast continued to fly straight towards Yun Che. This time, it was clear to everyone that the Ice Phoenix had successfully reduced its power with its sacrifice… but it was still an incredibly terrifying attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che came to a stop. He had used the bought time to channel his power to the peak, and the condensed, scarlet profound energy of Rumbling Heaven shook violently like it would spiral out of control at any moment. Locking onto the sword blast with both his sight and spiritual perception, Yun Che abruptly spread his arms open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sealing—Cloud—Locking—Sun!!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heretic God Barrier spread to several kilometers away almost instantly. At the same time, the sword blast struck the Heretic God Barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The impact sounded incredibly shrill. It was so discomfiting that it was like a thousand saws were sawing one’s heart. Not a single person in the spectator stands tried to cover up their ears, however. They were all staring at the Conferred God Stage without blinking...</span></p>

The terrible screeching continued as the two energies clashed against one another, but the half transparent barrier was definitely working as intended.</span></p>

As the screeching took on a new pitch, the Heretic God Barrier began shrinking rapidly.</span></p>

However, the Heretic God Barrier continued to shrink at a rapid pace until it was barely a hundred meters wide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword blast’s power was definitely decreasing, but it still felt near impossible to defend against. Although the rate at which the Heretic God Barrier was shrinking was slowing, its power was still inferior to the sword blast every step of the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, the Heretic God Barrier stopped shrinking when it was less than thirty meters wide, looking like it had reached a point where it could barely hold out against the sword blast. However, not only was the Heretic God Barrier fully deformed at this point, a pale white crack had suddenly spread and covered more than half its surface in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che sweated like he was standing under the rain. Nearly every muscle in his body was shaking uncontrollably.</span></p>

At this point, Yun Che was aware that he and his barrier were approaching their limits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No, not like this...</span></p>

He clenched his teeth, and fire suddenly appeared on his body and flowed into the Heretic God Barrier. It quickly turned the colorless barrier into a fiery one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the Heretic God Barrier exploded into a gigantic sea of golden flames, causing the Nameless Sword’s blast to detonate at the same spot as well. A large portion of the Conferred God Stage crumbled, and broken jade bits flew all over the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che was thrown out of the flames as quick as a meteor. The explosion had reopened his chest wound, and blood spilled all over the place yet again.</span></p>

However, the landing wasn’t enough to stop his momentum, and his bloody figure kept on bouncing towards the back.</span></p>

Assuming that he was still alive and aware after the impact, there was still no way he would have any strength left to alter his momentum. The outcome was already decided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when everyone thought that Yun Che would cross the boundary and lose the match, a blue light suddenly shot out of Yun Che’s body and transformed into an Ice Phoenix. The Manifest God flapped its wings, threw a hail of ice behind Yun Che and swept him back where he had come from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The profound handle could be unleashed with a single thought. Neither physical gestures nor profound energy were necessary… it was one of the best points of the profound handle.</span></p>

His bones felt like they were falling apart, and pain assaulted every one of his senses. The Ice Phoenix was withdrawn immediately because he barely had any strength left in his body. Even supporting his own weight was becoming an issue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che pressed a hand to his chest and resealed all of his wounds with ice. Although he was shaking with pain, the corners of his mouth were curled slightly upwards… The reason he smiled was because he had ultimately managed to block Jun Xilei’s second attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had to use nearly all of his strength, and the impact had wounded him severely just like before… but still, he had undoubtedly thwarted the attack!</span></p>

A long time later, she let out a quiet sigh. “I’m… no match for him.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shui Qianheng shot her a sideway glance but maintained his silence.</span></p>

There are two reasons behind Yun Che’s actions: one, he wanted to take it out on Jun Xilei, and two, he wanted to conceal his strength.” Shui Yingyue looked up slightly. “His goal isn’t Jun Xilei or I… he’s planning to beat Luo Changsheng!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had only been three days since Yun Che went away from the stage, but his new strength could be said to have stunned the entire Eastern Divine Region.</span></p>

He was severely wounded, and he had collapsed on the ground. He looked like he was having difficulty even standing. However, no one was laughing at his wretched state or looking at him with scorn in their eyes… even the realm kings of star realms were having problems controlling the wild beating of their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the beginning of the Conferred God Battle, Yun Che was suspected, scorned, and ridiculed as the shame of all profound practitioners. Then, he astounded everyone with his strength and shook the entire Eastern Divine Region… Every time he went on stage, he would deliver a new level of shock to their senses. Every time he stood on the Conferred God Stage, they had to reevaluate their views of him...</span></p>

However, while there might be another “Jun Xilei” or “Luo Changsheng” in the future, they simply couldn’t imagine encountering another “Yun Che”!</span></p>
