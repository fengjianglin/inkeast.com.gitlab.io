 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black clothed middle aged man’s words shocked everyone present; even Ji Ruyan’s beautiful face had slightly changed.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I mean exactly what I just said.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black clothed middle aged man slowly walked toward Yun Che. His attitude was not as warm as Ji Ruyan as he continued with a cold, hard face. “News just came about the lord who captured this royal wood spirit. He wants to take back the royal wood spirit. Since that’s the case, this transaction will be nulled. Our apologies but don’t worry, we will refund all your purple profound stones without missing a single one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he said “our apologies”, the way he spoke was obviously an order that couldn’t be refused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This…” Ji Ruyan quickly walked to the black clothed middle aged man’s front. After a slight moment of hesitation, she asked, “Our Black Feather Merchant Guild has never taken back something we have sold. May… I ask what has happened?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black clothed middle aged man gave her a glance. Even though he was looking at Ji Ruyan, his gaze was still cold. His mouth moved slightly as he sent her a short sound transmission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!?” It was unknown what she had heard but Ji Ruyan’s beautiful countenance suddenly worsened. She even took a step back, as though she had received a huge fright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Yun Che was about to speak, he suddenly felt the wood spirit boy in his grasp tremble from head to toe. A little hand tightly clutched the edge of his clothes as his shivering body shrunk behind him. It was obvious that he was frightened of the fact that Yun Che might return him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che turned around and looked directly at the black clothed middle aged man. “Is this how your Black Feather Merchant Guild does things?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, absolutely not!” Before the black clothed middle aged man had yet to speak, Ji Ruyan hurriedly answered. Being able to manage this kind of trade fair meant that her ability to take control of the situation was extraordinary. However, the light in her eyes was trembling at the moment; it was obvious that she truly was at a great loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The reason why our Black Feather Merchant Guild has been able to tower above the Darkya Realm for fifty thousand years is because of our extreme adherence to our principles. This servant can assure you that such a thing like forcibly taking back something sold has never happened before. It’s just that this situation is extremely special… How about this, as long as you are willing to return him, not only will we give back all of the four hundred million purple profound stones, this servant is willing to give you fifty million purple profound stones as an apology.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This stunned everyone present… An apology of fifty million purple profound coins! Even to people at their level, this was an extremely large number. Its sincerity was unquestionable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, willing?” Yun Che coldly laughed. “A merchant guild that would hold a shady trade fair actually has the face to talk about principles?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che relentlessly taunted, originally thinking that she would just laugh it off without care. He didn’t expect Ji Ruyan to instantly pale and hang her head. She fiercely bit her lip, without a single retort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che, “???”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che looked at the black clothed middle aged man again and said expressionlessly, “I think you’ve completely misunderstanding something. I have already handed over all of the profound stones that I needed to pay. Now that this royal wood spirit is in my hands, the transaction is already complete. In that case, the four hundred million profound stones are yours and this wood spirit is mine. It no longer has any relation to your Black Feather Merchant Guild. Take back? You seem to not have any qualifications to say those words.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the room held their breaths as they looked at each other in dismay. This was the Black Feather Merchant Guild’s territory, so no one dared to act up. Many people were vaguely able to guess the identity of this black clothed middle aged man, so they were incredibly scared. This was also why no one dared to ask Ji Ruyan about the black clothed man’s identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who would’ve known that Yun Che would act so unyielding before this black clothed man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, young man, it’s best to not be so impulsive,” the black clothed middle aged man actually laughed. “You are right. Since the transaction is complete, you would be the one who has to return the royal wood spirit. Forcibly taking it back is indeed not appropriate but I must warn you, the people who want this wood spirit are those both you and I cannot afford to offend, more you than me. In fact, it’d be best if you obediently return it so everything will end up well. I’m afraid you can’t handle the consequences otherwise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was very obvious that he also did not want to shed all forms of civility. After all, Yun Che being able to toss out four hundred million purple profound stones without batting an eye was astonishing. It definitely meant that he had an extremely strong backer and background. Unless he had no other choice, it was obvious that he would not choose to completely offend him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But little did he know that… let alone a backer, Yun Che didn’t even have a companion. He was completely alone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, if fifty million purple profound stones is not enough of a compensation, you can put up any other conditions. As long as it is something within my abilities, I will definitely satisfy you,” Ji Ruyan said softly, the light in her eyes filled with slight implorement and… anxiousness?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Yun Che was about to reply, Ji Ruyan’s sound transmission suddenly rang beside his ears, “Sir Ling Yun, please return him. The situation is far more grave than you can possibly imagine. This involves an upper star realm! Furthermore, the person in front of you comes from a great background. Take advantage of the fact that he is currently not willing to thoroughly offend you to quickly comply or else… not only will he forcibly take it back, he might even kill you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To a lower star realm, an upper star realm was an existence similar to a palace in the heavens. If an upper star realm really was involved in this, then even the Realm King of a lower star realm would pale in fright and hand over the wood spirit while stumbling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, they just had to encounter Yun Che. He narrowed his eyes, pretending not to have heard Ji Ruyan’s sound transmission as he coldly laughed at the black clothed middle aged man. “He’s already mine. If I don’t want to hand him over, what are you going to do to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir!” Ji Ruyan exclaimed softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha,” the black clothed middle aged man laughed weirdly but there was no smile on his face. “It looks like you’d rather have it the hard way!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following the change in his tone and expression, the entire room suddenly became oppressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha.” Yun Che also laughed the same way. “What? Since asking with a thick skin doesn’t work, you want to shamelessly steal in public now?”</span></p>

As if he was a black hawk rushing out of the night at the speed of thunder, he opened a hand and grabbed at the wood spirit boy behind Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the black clothed middle aged man suddenly took action, powerful profound energy at the Divine Tribulation Realm surged within the room, immediately scattering those who sat in the front row in fright.</span></p>

The Heaven Smiting Sword then appeared in his hand as he opened Purgatory and welcomed the pouncing black clothed man with a sweep of his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s profound strength was only at the second level of the Divine Soul Realm so he wasn’t considered anything before the black clothed man. However, Yun Che’s tossing of the four hundred million purple profound stones and his dignified aura made him worry about Yun Che’s background. This was why even though he had taken action, he only went for the wood spirit and not Yun Che. He didn’t expect that not only did Yun Che not flee in panic under the release of his Divine Tribulation might, he had actually taken out his weapon to meet his attack head on.</span></p>

The energy storm coming at him was like a flood dragon launching itself out of the sea. Its pressure instantly suffocated him, leaving him in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom boom boom———</span></p>

He retreated in panic, yet he was still ruthlessly sent flying, knocking against the stone wall behind him, shattering the wall protected by high level profound patterns into pieces. He fiercely raised his head, eyes no longer possessing his previous dark certainty. Only deep shock and incredulity was within them as his right arm slightly trembled, almost losing all feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene left everyone in the stone room dumbstruck… That frightening power from before was actually from someone in the Divine Soul Realm?

When the numbing sensation in his right arm gradually disappeared, he suddenly shouted as a streak of black colored lightning shot out from his opened fingers. He grasped onto a pitch-black longspear, sizzling with lightning that resembled dozens of dancing True Dragons and thrust it at Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Black Soul Lightningstar… He really is from the Soul Sect,” softly uttered someone at the far end of the stone room.</span></p>

The incoming black colored lightning was like dancing demonic serpents yet he completely ignored them and sent down a Falling Moon Sinking Star.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wood spirit boy was sent flying by Yun Che’s push and landed far away. In his fright, he helplessly sat there in a daze, forgetting to stand up for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not even thirty meters behind him was a shocked Ying Yushan. When he saw that the royal wood spirit was close, after a brief period of hesitation, he gritted his teeth and rushed over, grabbing at the wood spirit boy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom boom!!!</span></p>

The black colored profound lightning on the spear’s body completely dispersed as the nine foot spear was directly smashed into a crescent moon shape. The black clothed middle aged man’s entire body was jolted under the incredibly huge power force before he was once more ruthlessly sent flying into the wall behind him, feet not even touching the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom——</span></p>

A trickle of red blood also surprising flowed from the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After smashing the black clothed man in one strike, Yun Che borrowed the recoiling power of and flipped backwards. Bringing along an intense windstorm as he pounced at Ying Yushan, who was approaching the wood spirit boy, he smashed his fist down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The exposed Ying Yushan totally did not expect the forward jumping Yun Che to instantly turn back. Before he had time to lift his head in shock, Yun Che’s fist heavily smashed onto his chest… In that instant, he felt as though all the bones in his body had shattered. He spurted out a bloody mist several meters long as he was sent flying amidst his miserable screams. He was ruthlessly smashed into the stone wall at the very end of the stone room and caused the entire room to intensely quake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Instead, they all slowly retreated in terror. Ying Yushan’s profound strength had reached the peak of the Divine Soul Realm yet Yun Che, who was obviously at the second level of the Divine Soul Realm… had, in one punch, in merely one punch, heavily injured him to the point of losing consciousness!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“ARGHHHHH!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wild wind storm raged behind Yun Che as an image of a huge black snake appeared behind the black clothed middle aged man. Lightning sizzled around his entire body as a wave of an incredibly terrifying aura rapidly spread outward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Soul Sect’s…. Black Lightning Snake!” someone exclaimed in shock.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Riiip!!</span></p>

Following the black clothed man’s furious roar, that black snake image suddenly became alive and brought all the lightning on his body with it as it slithered onto the spear. In an instant, the black soul spear transformed into an enormous, malevolent snake. It spread its dark fangs and came at Yun Che with terrifying lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black clothed man was in a fit of rage after being beaten back twice by Yun Che. He no longer dared to underestimate his opponent nor hold back in the slightest. In fact, he had already begun to feel fear and panic… because he originally hadn’t considered the early stage Divine Soul Realm Yun Che to be anything, so he wasn’t worried at all that he could escape with the royal wood spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Never in his dreams did he expect that the true strength of Yun Che, who clearly had profound strength at the second level of the Divine Soul Realm, would actually be terrifying enough to defy common sense! What he feared was not Yun Che but the fate he would face if he allowed Yun Che to take the royal wood spirit away. It would be worse than death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two days had not yet passed since Yun Che had obtained Mu Xuanyin’s Ice Phoenix vital yin, so he wasn’t completely clear on where his current strength truly lay. However, once he realized that this black clothed man in the early stages of the Divine Tribulation Realm didn’t pressure him much, he had total confidence in himself. In front of the all out attack, Yun Che pushed the wood spirit boy away yet again before meeting the incoming strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the wood spirit boy had been pushed even further away. However, with Ying Yushan being a lesson for all, no one dared to step forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Destroying... Sky... Decimating... Earth!!”</span></p>

Within the energy storm raised by the Heaven Smiting Sword, the black lightning snake was immediately pressed down. However, as though it had been completely infuriated, it screeched and pounced onto the profound energy storm, resisting the sword might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom boom!!</span></p>

He would never believe that his own power… his all out power, had actually been directly blocked by Yun Che!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No, it should be said that it was he who had blocked Yun Che’s power… and he had barely defended against it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s face remained cool and calm. In comparison, the arms of the black clothed man holding the black lightning snake continued to fiercely tremble as sweat poured through his entire body like rivers. The tremendous power that was pressing down onto his spear and body was like a towering mountain that was slowly collapsing on top of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” As the heavy sword slowly pressed down, the black soul spear slowly bent and the black lightning snake coiled around it began to wail. The black clothed man’s eyes enlarged as more and more intense terror began to condense within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumbling… Heaven!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che stated in his mind and thus the Heretic God’s fourth gate opened without mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s profound strength increased exponentially at that moment. The black lightning snake that had been able to bitterly put up a resistance let out a tragic cry as it was instantly ripped apart. The bones in the black clothed man’s arms completely shattered and he was sent flying by the berserk profound energy storm, blood spraying as he went. During his flight, the black soul spear also flew out of his grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che made a grabbing motion and sucked the black soul spear into his hands before fiercely throwing it out.</span></p>

The horizontal flight path of his body was then firmly nailed onto the ground as blood splashed all over the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Drip...</span></p>

The crowd of profound practitioners from the Darkya Realm at the rear were closely pressed against the wall, stupefied. Completely drenched in sweat, let alone saying a word, they didn’t even dare to breathe too loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Second level of the Divine Soul Realm… in a few short direct confrontations, had completely crushed an expert in the Divine Tribulation Realm and inflicted grievous injuries!</span></p>

The sound of his footsteps, that weren’t even heavy at all, seemed to tread upon the hearts of everyone present. He came before the black clothed man, looked down upon his current miserable state with cold indifference and leisurely spoke, “The next time you want to ask for something, your attitude needs to be a bit more gentle. Otherwise, if you’re unlucky enough to come across someone like me… you will only be seeking death!”</span></p>
