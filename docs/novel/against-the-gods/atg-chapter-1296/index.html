However, Qianye Ying’er’s figure started to grow thin and hollow before directly vanishing into thin air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue’s originally gloomy and dark eyes finally regained some of their previous vigor, and it was also at this moment that she suddenly sensed the presence of profound energy… That red crack had not only broken apart Qianye Ying’er’s afterimage and severed a few strands of her hair, it had also broken the profound energy seal that had been placed on her and Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of her, a red figure soundlessly appeared from midair. She coldly gazed at the Qianye Ying’er who had instantly blinked away to a spot several kilometers away from here. The bright red dagger she held in her hand radiated a fearsomely cold light… yet this cold light was nothing compared to the ice-cold killing intent radiating from her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A girl dressed in rainbow robes descended from the sky at this moment before standing at her side. Astonishingly enough, this young girl was holding an azure greatsword that was much bigger than her small and delicate body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jasmine and Caizhi!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If she had been&nbsp;slower by even a fraction of a second, her face and even her entire skull would have been split open by that red line.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She extended a finger and lightly traced the incomparably smooth surface of that broken off piece, the eyes underneath that golden mask suddenly flashed with an extremely dangerous golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quickly take him away!” Both Jasmine’s eyes and expression were dreadfully dark and serious. That killing intent, which had the faint smell of fresh blood mixed in, had practically engulfed the entire starting location of the God Realm of Absolute Beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue’s body flashed and she arrived at Yun Che’s side. She gathered Yun Che into her arms, but she did not make any move to leave… She had clearly just escaped danger and her jade mien was still a ghastly white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because the only one who had escaped danger was her. Yun Che’s Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you still standing around for? Hurry up and get out of here!!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she saw that Xia Qingyue had not moved for a while, Jasmine’s tone immediately grew several degrees more serious and anxious. Xia Qingyue did not recognize her, but she had known Xia Qingyue since twelve years ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she and Caizhi had just arrived, Yun Che was already knocked unconscious so she did not know that Qianye Ying’er had placed the Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark on Yun Che. Otherwise, she would, on the contrary, have absolutely not asked Xia Qingyue to flee with Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Qingyue gritted her jade teeth together tightly. But with Qianye Ying’er nearby, it did not allow her even the slightest bit of hesitation. She swiftly summoned the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace and carried Yun Che inside before fleeing far away in the next instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er did not try to stop them… It was as if she felt that there was no need to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace raced away at its maximum speed as it flew into distant sky above… In that place towered a swirling pale white vortex. That was the exit of the God Realm of Absolute Beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jasmine silently breathed a sigh of relief and the aura that she had fixed on Qianye Ying’er grew even colder as her killing intent grew even more dreadful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whether it was Xia Qingyue and Yun Che’s escape, or the Heavenly Slaughter Star God’s killing intent, it did not cause Qianye Ying’er’s expression to change in the slightest. Her finger left the curved surface of the broken corner of her mask as she slowly strode forward and drew nearer to Jasmine and Caizhi. As she walked forward, she spoke in a languid voice, “With just the two of you alone, there’s no way you could get rid of Uncle Gu in such a short period of time. It looks like you have other accomplices as well… Could it be that there’s a third Star God?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qian… ye!!” A boundless seething hatred was somehow contained within those two short words. No matter whether it was Jasmine or Caizhi, Qianye Ying’er was the person they hated the most in their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because she was the one who had indirectly caused the death of Jasmine’s mother, had been the direct cause of their brother’s death, and had very nearly killed Jasmine as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heavenly Slaughter, if you were hidden in the shadows, I would still be somewhat wary of you. But not only have you chosen to appear before me, you have even brought along that wolf pup who hasn’t grown up yet…” Qianye Ying’er’s voice suddenly grew cold as she continued to speak, “Did you two sisters come specially to die today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jasmine’s killing intent grew even more condensed as she pointed the God Slaying Blade forward, the edge of the blade flashing with a bloody light that no one could look at directly, “Today, the one who is about to die is you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With that being said, aren’t you going to explain why you had chased us to this place?” Qianye Ying’er was growing closer and closer and even though she was facing down two great Star Gods, her now-cold voice did not sound the least bit tense, “The God Realm of Absolute Beginning, what a perfect burial ground. It can’t be that the two of you have really come to this place to die, correct? Or are you prepared to tell me… that you’ve come specially to kill me? But I’m thinking that you, Heavenly Slaughter, can’t be so stupid as to think that, correct?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should have died a long time ago!” Jasmine said coldly. But within her heart of hearts, she understood better than anyone that she would definitely not be able to kill Qianye Ying’er in her current situation… Even her and Caizhi added together would definitely not be able to kill her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had brought along Caizhi and moved towards the Moon God Realm at the fastest speed possible because she was afraid that Yun Che would lose control of his emotions the moment he saw Xia Qingyue, inducing the great wrath of the Moon God Realm… Given Yun Che’s temperament, that outcome was most definitely within the realm of possibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they had reached the Moon God Realm, Xia Qingyue had already fled together with Yun Che… However, she had suddenly sensed Qianye Ying’er’s aura moving into the distance and astonishingly enough, her aura was moving in the direction that the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace had fled in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jasmine knew more than anyone else just how dreadful Qianye Ying’er was. Once she realized this, she could no longer be bothered about the consequences and she brought Caizhi along with her as she tailed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you wanted to kill me so much that you’ve chased me all the way here, why don’t you make your move?” Qianye Ying’er grew ever closer and she was already within three hundred meters of them. At their current level, that distance was no more than a single instant to any one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Jasmine’s brows sank by yet another degree. She was rather puzzled and suspicious. Because why had Qianye Ying’er not become the least bit anxious now that Xia Qingyue had fled together with Yun Che?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, I know now.” Qianye Ying’er’s lips curved up as she looked as if she had suddenly seen the light, “It turns out that you are trying to stall for enough time to allow them to escape, aren’t you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jasmine, “...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s just that I’m really curious. You did not hesitate to bring along this wolf pup and chase us all the way here from the Eastern Divine Region. So, in the end, was it to protect the divine power of the Heretic God, or was it to… protect your little lover?”</span></p>

Hahahaha…” Upon seeing Jasmine’s reaction, Qianye Ying’er let out a big laugh, “The other time, I personally saw you weeping in pain because of Yun Che, but I still could not quite bring myself to believe it. But right now, it looks like no matter how unbelievable or unfathomable this whole thing is, it is one hundred percent true. To think that the distinguished elder princess of the Star God Realm, the one who is seen as the most bloodthirsty and merciless Star God in the eyes of the world, would actually fall in love with a man, and a man from the lower realms at that. This is all very entertaining, simply far too entertaining.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh heh, whatever you spoke to that wolf pup at that time, I heard all of it,” Qianye Ying’er said in a cheery voice. “To think that the heart of the Heavenly Slaughter Star God, whose spiritual perception is said to be the sharpest within the God Realm, would actually be thrown into such disorder because of a man, that even though my divine senses pierced the isolating barrier that you erected, you were none the wiser. Right now, I am indeed extremely curious as to what earth-shaking thing Yun Che did in order to steal the soul of a calamitous star like you, whose hands are stained with fresh blood and whom everybody dreads.”</span></p>

Originally, she had indeed only wanted to delay Qianye Ying’er with all her strength in order to buy time for Yun Che to flee. But right now, a desire to kill Qianye Ying’er, which was far more intense than it had been at any other time, had been birthed in her heart.</span></p>

No matter how great or grand your methods are, it still isn’t possible. So you should just give up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? So what?”</span></p>

She took a step forward, the bloody light of her God Slaying Blade flashing, “Also, today is the day that you… must… die!!”</span></p>

The God Slaying Blade drew countless scarlet traces in the air as they shot directly towards Qianye Ying’er…</span></p>
