 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But they would never have imagined that, beneath those dark clouds that had covered the entire Eastern Divine Region, a completely unprecedented and earthshaking lightning tribulation was currently pouring down from the sky.</span></p>

In fact, it was so absurd that no one had even tried to consider it before.</span></p>

But the sea of lightning on the Conferred God Stage continued to rage and toss in a frenzied manner, annihilating everything that was engulfed within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the heavenly tribulation lightning was extremely terrifying, it would not harm any living creature unless someone chose to forcibly impede or interfere with it. As a result, all of the might of the tribulation lightning was focused within the perimeters of the Conferred God Stage, even though scarlet lightning was flashing all throughout the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If not for this, it was likely that the entire Eternal Heaven God Realm would have dissolved into a sea of lightning by now.</span></p>

The ones who survived four stages would lord over a realm, the ones who withstood five stages were destined to become Divine Masters and the sixth stage was a legend that had appeared only once in history.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The red light which connected the heavens and the earth had faded, but the scarlet sea of lightning roiling about in the Conferred God Stage continued to toss and turn. The dreadful and extremely dense power of the lightning tribulation would not completely fade away even if another two hours passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this time, the blood red lightning region that hung in the sky had finally quieted down and had begun to slowly recede, just like the purple lightning region that had quickly disappeared previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this time, it receded in an even more thorough fashion. Within a few short breaths, it had contracted to a tenth of its previous size and it still had not stopped shrinking… as it gradually approached the verge of complete dissolution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The red light that had previously covered the world had also grown dimmer and dimmer following this. Finally, with a gentle whine, the lightning region completely disappeared and only boundless and vast black clouds continued to roil and toss in the blue dome of the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However the scarlet sea of lightning atop the Conferred God Stage continued to release a dense scarlet glow.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the black clouds continued to toss about in the sky and it did not look like they were going to disperse at all. The oppressive might brought about by the heavenly law which had engulfed the entire Eastern Divine Region remained firmly pressed upon everyone’s heart and soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Finally… it’s over.”</span></p>

The lightning tribulation had finally ended, but the shock and horror it had evoked in their hearts would perhaps never fully dissipate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the moment that the first bolt of tribulation lightning fell from the sky to the recent moment that the lightning region had disappeared. Now that they thought about it, it all seemed like a dream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eight stages of tribulation lightning. If I had not witnessed it myself, I would not be able to ever bring myself to believe such a thing.” The Eternal Heaven God Emperor muttered to himself softly as he gazed up at the black clouds which covered the sky, “From today onwards, the entire God Realm will react dramatically to what has happened here today. This year’s Profound God Convention will also leave its mark forever in the annals of history. Furthermore, it might be a mark that never gets exceeded.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” The Dragon Monarch’s gaze remained fixed upon the sea of lightning which engulfed the Conferred God Stage. It was only after a long period of time that he finally looked up and gazed towards the heavens…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the lightning region had disappeared, the tossing and turning of those black clouds seemed to have calmed down a bit. However the aura in the air seemed to become even more oppressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eight stages of tribulation lightning… Ssss… Was this truly… brought about by Yun Che? It wasn’t some sort of… natural calamity?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That was too… far too terrifying. It was at least a million times more terrifying than the most terrifying nightmare I have had in my life. Eight stages of tribulation lightning… If someone were to survive that… what would that person become in the future?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That lightning tribulation was so terrifying that even our Sect Master would not be able to endure it, so how could Yun Che still be alive!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huuu….” Shui Qianheng slowly regulated his breathing but waves still tossed about turbulently in his heart. He cast a sideways gaze at Shui Meiyin but Shui Meiyin continued to blankly stare at the Conferred God Stage, her milk-white face completely dazed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Meiyin, you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother Yun Che is still alive…” she softly whispered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Shui Qianheng’s brows furrowed together and he had even turned his body around at the sound of those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can sense that Big Brother Yun is still alive, and… and…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And what?” Shui Qianheng impatiently asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” However Shui Meiyin did not respond. Instead she continued to stare dazedly at the Conferred God Stage as a light that was more shimmery and lustrous than the stars themselves shone in the depths of her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she had engaged in a soul battle with Yun Che, she had been utterly crushed by Yun Che’s despicable actions. As she suffered from the backlash of this, her soul had been invaded by Yun Che and his soul imprint had been stamped into her soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps the sudden feelings of love and infatuation she had toward Yun Che were in large part because of what had happened during their soul battle. And this was something that she herself had noticed as well, or perhaps it would be better to say that she was extremely clear that this was the case. Moreover, her Divine Stainless Soul was so strong that wiping away the soul imprint Yun Che had left inside of her would be as easy as waving her hand, yet she had not chosen to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because she liked and very much enjoyed the feeling of suddenly pining for someone, she enjoyed feeling her heart fill up with joy just at the sight of him.</span></p>
