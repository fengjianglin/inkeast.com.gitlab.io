It showed effusive gratitude when Mu Bingyun had given her nod of approval. The Azure Snow Ice <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qilin</span> was actually so happy that it was moved to tears and it practically broke its head open as it kowtowed repeatedly to Mu Bingyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once it had retreated a certain distance, the Azure Snow Ice <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qilin</span> suddenly picked up speed as it practically scrambled to get as far away from Mu Bingyun as it could. It was as if it was afraid that she would change her mind. It no longer had a single shred of might and dignity befitting its status as a lord of the profound beasts. The only thing left in its mind was that deep terror which could cause its will to collapse again and again, a fear so terrible that it would ensure that the Azure Snow Ice <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qilin</span> would never even think of rebelling ever again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To think that this mission actually ended with no blades crossed and no blood spilled,” Mu Tanzhi said happily. Just like everyone else, the pressure in his heart had completely vanished into the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Bingyun stared into the distance and muttered to herself, “Who exactly…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She asked the Azure Snow Ice <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qilin</span> to tell her who exactly pushed it into this corner, but the extreme fear on the Azure Snow Ice <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qilin</span>’s face was plain for all to see as it frantically denied there was such a person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When a Divine Sovereign profound beast displayed such fear, it was very likely that it had come into contact with the imperious might of a Divine Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, it seemed like this person had been extremely vicious toward the Azure Snow Ice <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qilin</span> as it was clearly frightened out of its wits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are two possibilities,” Mu Tanzhi said. “The first is the Moon God Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Bingyun’s icy eyes instantly grew even more glacial. She said in a cold voice, “It won’t be them. When the Moon God Emperor publicly announced that she owed a debt of gratitude to the Snow Song Realm and warned everyone not to attack or offend us, it was merely to show that she wasn’t an ungrateful person… Heh, if she truly did send someone to help us with this matter, she’d already be clamoring to announce it to the entire Eastern Divine Region.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then it has to be the Flame God Realm.” Mu Tanzhi spied Mu Bingyun’s expression with a single glance as he let out a soft sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the Flame God Realm and Snow Song Realm had known since long ago that the Flame God Realm King Huo Poyun was infatuated with Mu Feixue. In reality, as long as Mu Feixue said a single word, the Flame God Realm King could easily suppress the overlord of both regions even if they revolted at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, favors were things that still had to be returned. Moreover, everyone was keenly aware… of just how the Flame God Realm King hoped that these favors would be returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, neither answer was one that Mu Bingyun wanted to hear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s return to the sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She barked out that command before she took to the skies and flew back in the direction she had come from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This large profound beast revolt had been resolved far better than she could ever have hoped for, but Mu Bingyun’s heart was still restless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the profound beast army had retreated into their nests, the Divine Ice Phoenix Sect disciples departed as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This region of boundless snow had fallen into silence once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distant skies above, in a space where no one had bothered looking, a faint, icy blue light suddenly flashed through the sky. It was like the twinkling of a falling star and it vanished in the blink of an eye, leaving no traces behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ————</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Yama Emperor walking ahead of her and the Yama Devils trailing behind her, they politely escorted Chi Wuyao out of the Yama Imperial District and dazedly watched her fly into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the imperial hall, Yun Che was a motionless and silent statue. He closed his eyes as he quietly contemplated what had just happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just a little while ago, he had connected his aura to the dark yin energy of the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness as Yan One and Yan Three had used their energy fields to restrict Chi Wuyao’s movement. The Yama Emperor and his Yama Devils had all been lying in wait outside the hall… As he pointed a single finger toward Chi Wuyao, he had arrogantly asked her how she was going to escape from this situation now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This had undoubtedly been a “duel” between Yun Che and Chi Wuyao, but Chi Wuyao had not only successfully turned the tables on him, he’d even… been completely defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, his heart and mind had practically collapsed in front of this “master” that he had suddenly regained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There really was nothing more beautiful in this world than regaining something you had once thought was lost forever. The more pain and suffering caused by its loss, the more impactful its return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he had only regained a part of what he had lost...&nbsp;</span></p>

But an even deeper feeling of blankness now engulfed his heart even after he had managed to calm down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During those years, she had indeed been his master… This was one point that he did not suspect.</span></p>

After that, she even spent all of her time and effort on him and him alone. The other core disciples were only allowed to enter the Heavenly Netherfrost Lake for a single day, but he had been allowed to bathe in it for an entire year.</span></p>

Her experiences, cunning… and her Devil Emperor soul especially are not things Mu Xuanyin can come close to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xuanyin’s experience with me was her everything.

After all, if Chi Wuyao could become so easily “infatuated” with a man, how could she ever become the Soul Stealing Realm’s Devil Queen, someone who stood above the rest of the Northern Region?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m unable to answer Master’s question,” He Ling said softly. “Just like how I could never understand why Master Shen Xi was willing to give her body to Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che was stunned by those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, Master’s words made me recall something from the past. I previously asked Master Shen Xi this question,” He Ling said as she started recounting the past. “At that time I asked Master Shen Xi this. No matter whether it is his cultivation or status, the Dragon Monarch is the strongest person in the universe. He has such an exalted position and he is so infatuated with you, so why hasn’t Master’s heart ever been moved by him even a little? Could it be that love didn’t exist in Master’s world?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master Shen Xi gave me this reply. It wasn’t that there was no such thing as love in her world. On the contrary, even the most emotionless woman would never be able to fully extinguish the embers of desire when it came to a beautiful thing like love. However, women were often more willing to be subdued by men who were stronger than them. The more powerful a woman and the loftier her position, the more likely this would apply to them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If there ever came a day where a man who was worthy of her infatuation appeared in her life, she might even choose… to proposition that person herself.”</span></p>

He was surprised that Shen Xi had given such an answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At that time, I couldn’t understand the answer that Master Shen Xi had given me. But…” He Ling paused as her voice grew even softer, “I think I understand now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are many powerful people in this world, but Master is the only person who is truly qualified to be with Master Shen Xi. You are the only one who can meet her standard in this universe,” He Ling said. “It’s the same thing with Yun Qianying. She used to view every man with contempt, even people who were as strong as the Southern Sea God Emperor and as infatuated as the Heavenly Wolf Xisu were nothing more than tools in her eyes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yet she’s changed so much after just a few short years at Master’s side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, Chi Wuyao is different. She’s a different breed from either of them.” Yun Che shook his head in disagreement when he heard He Ling’s words. “Chi Wuyao is not only good at using men, she is also a master at manipulating their emotions. She’s experienced far too many men over her long life and even the Clear Sky God Emperor fell at her hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could someone like her fall so easily in love with someone else? How could someone like her fall so completely in love with someone else?”</span></p>

Thus, even as her strength grew, she used men to climb the ladder of power. When she conquered them, she also slowly gained control of their power and wealth. She used that method to slowly grow more and more powerful as she went from a middle star realm to an upper star realm to a king realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she finally conquered the Clear Sky God Emperor, she had used some truly shocking methods to capture the entire Clear Sky God Realm. After that, she slowly transformed the Clear Sky God Realm into the Soul Stealing Realm, a star realm that was loyal to her alone, before she ascended the throne.</span></p>
