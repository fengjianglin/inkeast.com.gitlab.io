 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The god empress that was due to be wed to the Moon God Emperor was actually Yun Che’s lawfully wedded wife!?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone’s mouths had gaped open. The Snow Song and Flame God Realms were so shocked that their eyes were practically bulging out of their sockets, and their very souls were thrown into confusion. This was especially so for Huo Rulie, his mouth was gaping open so widely that one could just about stuff one Huo Poyun inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Moon God Emperor’s eyes were shaking wildly. He looked at Yun Che for a long time before slowly saying, “You… are truly her…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I am,” Yun Che said in a cold and hard voice before he turned and looked towards the Star God Emperor. “However, there is one thing I must make clear. The words that the Moon God Emperor just said did indeed not contain any falsity or excuses. Eight years ago, I was most certainly ‘dead’.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Moon God Emperor, “...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Star God Emperor’s brow furrowed greatly upon hearing those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At that time, everyone thought that I was dead, including Xia Qingyue. Furthermore, after that she arrived in the God Realm and has not seen me again, so naturally she was not aware that I still lived,” Yun Che said impassively. “That is also to say that before today, Xia Qingyue was indeed not aware that I was still alive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had definitely not said the words he had just spoken because he wanted to help the Moon God Emperor. Because of Jasmine, he definitely did not have any good feelings towards the Star God Emperor. Furthermore, the Star God Emperor had gotten ahold of his marriage contract and was clearly trying to use him. How could he be willing to be freely manipulated as the Star God Emperor’s tool?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So to her, the fact that I am still alive is merely an accident that ‘should not exist’.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This marriage contract was something I had given to Xia Qingyue’s maid ‘Jin Yue’ so that she could hand it over to Xia Qingyue. The purpose of doing all of this was so that she could erase this ‘accident’ with her own two hands. After all, even though she and I were once husband and wife, our feelings have always been thin and weak. Furthermore, we were separated by ‘death’ for eight years, heh… I’m afraid that there probably isn’t much left of what was an originally weak and thin relationship in the first place. So this marriage contract, that should have long ago been consigned to dust, could perhaps barely be considered to be the last remaining bit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s voice was very cold and it held nearly no emotion. He looked at the Star God Emperor and even though he was staring directly at a god emperor, his gaze still remained cold and cutting, “Everything I should have said has been said. Right now, I have a question that I wish to pose to the Star God Emperor… Why did this marriage contract end up in your possession!? And how and why did you come to the conclusion that the ‘Xiao Che’ written on this marriage contract was me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Moon God Emperor stared at Yun Che, a complex look in his eyes that no one else would be able to understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s explanation was beyond the Star God Emperor’s calculations and it had clearly messed up his own schemes. His expression grew faintly rigid as he gave a bland chuckle, “If this king told you that he had just picked it up, would you believe me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I believe you. Of course I believe you.” Yun Che nodded his head, “A distinguished god emperor of a king realm. It is definitely not possible for such a personage to stoop so low as to steal something secretly from another person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone present was so shaken up that they felt their brains had been rattled. At this moment, Yun Che was interrogating the Star God Emperor and making certain insinuations about him, and they could not even react in time to feel shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, so it turns out that he is her first husband who ‘has come back from the dead’, so it looks like the ‘taking by force’ hat doesn’t fit anymore,” Qianye Ying’er said with some disappointment. “This in addition to the fact Xia Qingyue’s vital yin aura still remains means that Xing Juekong will not be able to throw him for a loop this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she heard these words, it sounded like this matter had nothing to do with her, “However, being able to irritate Yue Wuya for a moment isn’t a bad idea either. But Yun Che on the other hand… Now things are about to get ugly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But that makes it all the more interesting, yes?” Qiangye Ying’er said with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a stream of air flowed across the area. The Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace, that had always been quietly floating in the light of the divine moon, suddenly flashed with profound light before it started to slowly move. It continued flying before finally coming to rest in the space above Yun Che and the rest of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The curtain of light opened and Xia Qingyue stepped out from behind it. She slowly floated to the ground, and it was as if a celestial fairy from the Moon Palace was descending to the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A mere glimpse of her from afar had already painted an inestimable portrait of beauty. But now that she had come forward and graced all of them with her presence, it caused a stifling sensation, that was hard to put into words, to assault everyone who saw her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today was the day of her marriage, the day that she was supposed to become a god empress, yet her long moon-white robes were exceptionally spare and simple. It was not even equivalent to the Divine Moon Robes worn by the daughters of the Moon God Emperor. Yet even this startlingly simple attire was exuding an incomparably eye-catching brilliance and grace because of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her eyes were extremely calm and tranquil, they resembled a secluded pool that would never be disturbed by anything. Yet they seemed to hold all the delicate beauty that this world had to offer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She merely stood there quietly, neither laughing nor scowling, but all eyes were focused on her. Even the two great god emperors, the Star God Emperor and the Moon God Emperor, had become mere props in the background when standing next to her, their presence unconsciously forgotten at that moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che looked at her before slowly averting his gaze. She was still Xia Qingyue, but compared to the past, she had completely and utterly changed. She was clearly so close to him, yet she radiated a mysterious and strange illusory feeling, it was as if she was a goddess that had strolled out of an ancient painting… It felt as if she should not exist on this sinful earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This thought silently flashed in nearly everyone’s hearts: Perhaps, just based on her heavenly beauty alone, she was sufficiently qualified to become a god empress, even if she did not have a Heart of Glazed Glass. Being at the summit of this universe’s ideal of beauty and grace, was now something that not only belonged to the Dragon Queen and Goddess, but also something that belonged to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qingyue,“ the Moon God Emperor looked at her, a complex look in his eyes, “is Yun Che truly the ‘previous husband’ that you told me about before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...Yes.” Xia Qingyue gave a light nod of her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che, “...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of saliva being swallowed spread across the crowd like a wave. It was fine to treat the words of everyone else who had spoken so far as assumptions, but with a single word from Xia Qingyue, this had become an absolutely irrefutable truth.</span></p>

Very quickly, a huge empty space was formed and only Yun Che and Xia Qingyue stood there, in silence in the middle of this empty world… as well as the Vanishing Moon Celestial Palace that was floating quietly in the air above them.</span></p>

Furthermore, the two of them have been husband and wife and had even come from the same place.”</span></p>

I had believed that the stars of this myriad universe were boundless and that this search would be akin to searching for a needle in a great ocean, a most arduous and difficult task. Yet who would have thought that the fortune of my Brahma Monarch God Realm was good and we would indeed find that very planet.”</span></p>

That planet ‘Neptune’ was a dead planet and there were no living creatures in it.”</span></p>

Him using ‘Neptune’ as a shield was something completely logical and natural. But as for you, Brahma Heaven God Emperor. You clearly knew that this information was false yet you spared no effort to search for this planet anyways. It looks like Yun Che has truly ‘caught your eye’.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahahaha,” the Brahma Heaven God Emperor gave a hearty laugh at that. “It’s not merely enough to call it ‘catching my eye’. If not, how would I be willing to betroth Ying’er to him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The will of the Goddess is something I am afraid that even you, the Brahma Heaven God Emperor, cannot interfere with. So this so-called ‘betrothal’ is no more or less the will of the Goddess herself.” The Eternal Heaven God Emperor’s eyes were profound and deep beyond measure. On the final day of the Conferred God Battle, the actions of the Brahma Monarch God Realm may have tricked everyone else, but it could not possibly have tricked him as well, “But given this old one’s minimal understanding of the Goddess, it is not possible for her ‘betrothal’ to be a genuine one. On the contrary, just this one word alone has caused Yun Che to be hated and envied by an innumerable amount of people. Moreover, this hatred and envy was spread across the entire God Realm.”</span></p>

As for what happens after the next three years, that is up to his own choices and destiny.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Given this current scenario and setting, the wedding celebration of a god emperor, she could not make any other choice. Because if she chose to abandon this wedding in the end, it would undoubtedly cause all the dignity and face that the Moon God Emperor had left to go down the drain. It would cause the Moon God Emperor, who was originally about to wash away the shame and humiliation he had suffered because of what had happened to Yue Wugou all those years ago, to truly become the greatest laughingstock under heaven.</span></p>
