 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Phoenix’s pupils were the only light source inside the dark space, but its scarlet, fiery glow looked like shadows to Yun Che right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The world fell completely silent. He looked like a soulless husk as he stared blankly towards the front with deadened eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Phoenix Spirit stopped talking. It was well aware that being crippled was a fate worse than death to a profound practitioner, especially when the one before it was a man who had once stood at the top of the continent, enjoyed unparalleled glory, and achieved many great things that might as well be miracles again and again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he had become a cripple after what felt like a journey in one’s dreams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was impossible to accept a nightmare like this without warning. Even a profound practitioner from the God Realm, a Divine Sovereign or even a Divine Master would’ve seen their willpower falter... especially considering that this was a nightmare that he would never wake up from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there a way… to recover from this?” His voice was incredibly weak and slow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no such thing as an easy resurrection,” the Phoenix Spirit answered him. “Right now, you’re just a mortal… A weak mortal who needs time to recover. Everything you had before is now in the past.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...Can I start over my cultivation after I recover?” Yun Che asked again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You cannot.” No matter how cruel the truth was, the Phoenix Spirit wouldn’t hide it from Yun Che. “The evil god’s profound veins are still inside you, but they have passed away from this world. There is no power in the entire world that can awaken the evil god profound veins… unless you can find another drop of Heretic God blood.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...” Yun Che stared blankly and emptily towards the front.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ice phoenix girl at the bottom of the Heavenly Netherfrost Lake had once told him that the Heretic God had ended his own life prematurely in order to leave behind a single drop of Indestructible Blood. This also meant that the Heretic God’s Indestructible Blood Jasmine found at the Southern Divine Region was well and truly the one and only inheritance the Heretic God had left behind for the world. Naturally, there was no such thing as another drop of Heretic God blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What this meant was that his power wasn’t the only thing he had lost. He had even lost his ability to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He would be a cripple for eternity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heh… hehe…” Yun Che let out an unbelievably withered laugh. “What kind… of a joke is this… this is the price… of my resurrection? This is your so-called… Nirvana…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Phoenix Spirit, “...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is your so-called Nirvana”, Yun Che had said. His words were without a doubt an affront to the Phoenix Spirit’s dignity, but it wasn’t angry at all. It was because he knew how shocking and cruel this realization was for Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why didn’t you just let me die…” Yun Che growled in a raspy voice, “At least I’d be able to accompany her in death… I promised her to meet her in the next world… why didn’t you let me die… why…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These few lines alone had exhausted his breath and made him feel dizzy. The bitter smile on his face grew even bleaker and more terrible than before… Crippled? This was clearly worse than even a sick old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn’t thought that he would be able to save Jasmine the day he broke into Star God Realm… but he had thought that he would at least be able to die with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had killed many Star Guards and a Star God Elder, it was of no detriment to the “ceremony” at all. Moreover, the ceremony must’ve been completed already considering that he was out for so many days. Jasmine and Caizhi were the sacrifices for the ceremony, so they were undoubtedly dead by now. But he… he had promised to accompany Jasmine to their next lives… yet he was still alive...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Alive as a cripple for eternity...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He slowly made a pair of fists through his shaking. He tried to lift his hands, only to run out of energy before he could even raise them past his waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t even commit suicide even if he wanted to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I understand your feelings.” The Phoenix Spirit said, “But life is the most precious thing the heavens have granted to every living being. No matter how petty and low one’s life has become, it is still something that should be respected and appreciated. Besides, is there really nothing more important to you than death right now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...” For a long time, Yun Che wasn’t able to say anything. As more and more images and faces flashed through his mind, his dim pupils started shaking harder and harder...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was on the Profound Sky Continent… he had finally come home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could finally meet those people that he had missed day and night and tell them that he had returned, but at the same time, he was… afraid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How am I going to face them like this?...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A very long silence later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you for granting me a second life,” Yun Che said slowly. He sounded a little calmer than before, but his hands were still gripped tightly into fists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know you cannot accept things as they are immediately.” The Phoenix Spirit said, “That's not a problem. There’s no need to force yourself to accept it immediately. As time passes, you will eventually find another reason to live, and maybe one day you may even come to realize that returning to normal isn’t a bad thing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, this was the only way it could console Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yun Che’s current state was something that could destroy the will of any profound practitioner. However, the Phoenix Spirit was the giver of Yun Che’s current life, which is why it didn’t wish to see Yun Che squander it in an eternal abyss of despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...” Yun Che didn’t answer it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go.” The Phoenix Spirit narrowed its scarlet eyes slightly. “Your second life isn’t just a gift, but a trial. If you can overcome this with your own willpower, you may not just be reborn in the body, but also… the soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yun Che, “...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Phoenix Spirit closed its eyes, and the world returned to darkness one more time before it turned bright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The world around Yun Che had changed soundlessly, and he had been returned to the entrance of the Phoenix’s trial grounds once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The barrier behind Yun Che resealed itself, and in front of him he saw Feng Xian’er, Feng Zu’er, Feng Baichuan, and many other Phoenix clansmen… everyone’s face was etched with deep worry and anxiety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their expressions immediately turned into care when they saw Yun Che. Feng Zu’er and Feng Xian’er were the first ones to make it to him and support him from both sides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A warm feeling rose from within Yun Che’s darkened heart. He could see that their care had come from the bottom of their hearts, and they hadn’t looked down on him or put up a pretense just because he had become a cripple. He forced a tiny smile onto his lips and said, “Senior Feng, I’m the one who asked Xian’er to bring me here. Please don’t blame her for this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Baichuan shook his head with a smile. “You should focus on recuperating first. Everything else can wait.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother Benefactor, let’s carry you back first.” Feng Zu’er said, “Mother has just finished cooking a pot of bamboo soup. I’m sure you’ll like it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The duo carried Yun Che and walked him towards their destination with incredible care. Yun Che resumed staring forward, at nothing in particular.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Phoenix’s ancestral ground, and it was situated at the center of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain Range. Everything except the scarlet sky above his head was practically the same as he remembered… It was probably a barrier the Phoenix Spirit had setup to protect the Phoenix Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Five years ago, the barrier had already existed when he and Feng Xue’er showed up… perhaps it had existed even before that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Feng,” Yun Che spoke up suddenly, “You all knew that I was crippled from the beginning, didn’t you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The palms that were supporting him tightened a little in unison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Baichuan’s footsteps slowed a little before he turned around to look at Yun Che amiably, “Lord Phoenix God informed us of this when he delivered you to us ten days ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yun Che, “...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My profound cultivation is pretty mediocre,” Feng Baichuan continued after a pause, “but even I understand that this is something you won’t be able to accept. However, no matter what happens to you now or in the future, you will always be our greatest benefactor… this will never change.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t lose heart, Big Brother Benefactor.” Feng Zu’er forced a smile onto his face, “This is all just a temporary thing. Maybe you’ll regain your powers slowly after you’ve recuperated, and, and… even if you can’t recover your lost powers, you can just… cultivate again from the beginning! Right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mn!” Feng Xian’er nodded firmly, “Big Brother Benefactor is so amazing, you were invincible throughout the world when you were just twenty or so years old. If you want to, you’ll definitely become as great as before… no, you’ll become even greater than before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Baichuan looked away and let out a sigh on the inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yun Che smiled bitterly, “Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back when he had first encountered them, the brother and sister were only eight years old. At the time, they had looked up to him with such reverence that their eyes looked like shining stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they had both grown up since then, they were still looking at him in admiration and reverence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they didn’t know that the man they had been admiring and chasing after since they were eight years old had become a complete cripple, and that he would never recover for eternity. In fact, his current condition was even worse than when his profound veins were crippled before he was sixteen years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the time, he was at least at first level of the Elementary Profound Realm, and was able to generate a spark of profound light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some time later, a low, dying tree entered his darkened vision. Its branches were wilted, its crooked trunk looked like it would collapse at any moment, and its few remaining dry leaves groaned with death as a breeze touched them during their final moments. It looked like an old man that was nearing the end of its lifespan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I would like to sit there for a moment,” Yun Che pointed at the old tree and whispered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xian’er and Feng Zu’er opened their mouths slightly as they stared at Feng Baichuan with a pleading look in their eyes. The latter nodded with conflicted eyes after a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The brother and sister carried Yun Che to the tree and allowed him to lean against its trunk, facing the wind and a nice, long view. Yun Che wanted to calm down and force himself into accepting his current reality, but his willpower and his mind seemed to have sunk into a bottomless abyss with no escape in sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I would like some quiet to myself.” Yun Che stared towards the front and whispered softer than even the mountain breeze blowing towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Baichuan nodded slightly and accepted his request. Unlike the innocent Feng Xian’er and Feng Zu’er, he knew far more about the despair Yun Che was experiencing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But… you can’t stay out here for too long, okay? You’ll get cold. Big Brother and I will come over and take you back later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Xian’er reminded him in worry before she finally left him. She kept looking back towards him even as she left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The breeze finally grew slightly stronger, strong enough to carry Yun Che’s messy hair into the air. However, his eyes still remained blank and spiritless, and the bleakness in his heart hadn’t faded in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes had returned to normal. The rock bits slightly beyond his vision were a blur to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bird was chirping right beside his ears, but he had no idea when it had became perched next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dry leaf landed on his shoulder, but he couldn’t sense the trajectory of its fall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His life would always be like this, now and forever.</span></p>
