The three god emperors dumbly stared at the image of the demonic infant in the skies above them. Their minds blanked out for a few moments but after they had snapped out of their stupor, one name exploded in their souls like millions of bolts of apocalyptic lightning.</span></p>

Even if the Star God Emperor had truly found it, even if he was ten million times crazier, there is still no way he would have woken it up on purpose!”</span></p>

It was the most terrifying existence in the whole world, in the entire history of the Primal Chaos.</span></p>

The only thing that remained of it were the records of it that were left behind, and every single word of those records were filled with terror and dread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Evil Infant Wheel of Myriad Tribulations would not disappear nor could it be destroyed. After it had destroyed all of the gods and devils, it still remained in some corner of this universe. People desired to find it but at the same time, they were also afraid to find it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was undoubtedly true that if one were to find any of the other Heavenly Profound Treasures, it would be the luckiest thing that could happen to them in all their lifetimes. But when it came to the Evil Infant Wheel of Myriad Tribulations… As long as it was not an absolutely insane and frenzied madman, one would definitely not hesitate to do all they could to seal it away if they managed to find it… Even if one had to organize and concentrate all of the power in the world to seal it away, no one would ever think of trying to awaken it or control it instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But today, in the Eastern Divine Region’s Star God Realm, after wiping out the gods and devils one million years ago, the Evil Infant Wheel of Myriad Tribulations had once again appeared in the world. Furthermore, it had not simply reappeared, it had revealed itself with an awakened Evil Infant and a world-shocking devilish energy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following the shattering and collapse of the Absolute Star Soul Barrier, the three god emperors could also clearly sense the auras of the Star God Emperor and the other Star Gods underneath the devilish energy that spread through the heavens. Furthermore, their auras were strange and chaotic, and it seemed as if all of them had sustained heavy injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Absolute Star Soul Barrier had been forcibly destroyed, so it was absolutely normal for them to sustain heavy injuries due to the backlash. Furthermore, being able to forcibly break the Absolute Star Soul Barrier meant that this power had exceeded the combined strength of the Star God Emperor, the Star Gods, and the Star God elders!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a power that surpassed any known level, a power that basically should not even exist in this current world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be that this is actually… the calamity of the Eastern Divine Region?” The Eternal Heaven God Emperor muttered to himself. After that, his brows sank and knit together and extended his arm, a rather large sound transmission profound formation appearing in front of him, “All Guardians, heed my command. The Evil Infant has reappeared, danger approaches the Eastern Divine Region. As such, no matter where you are and what situation you find yourself in, all of you are to immediately head to the Star God Realm at the greatest possible speed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BANG!!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Brahma Heaven God Emperor and the Moon God Emperor exchanged glances… The Eternal Heaven God Emperor had been absolutely right. If the Evil Infant had truly reemerged, then it was definitely a calamity that would strike the Eastern Divine Region! Underneath the shadow of this impending calamity, all of their grievances and resentments suddenly seemed utterly shallow and insignificant. The two great god emperors constructed sound transmission profound formations simultaneously as they both issued the most austere and solemn god emperor edicts:</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All Moon Gods, heed my command… immediately head to the Star God Realm at the fastest speed possible!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All Brahma Gods and Brahma Kings, heed my command… immediately head to the Star God Realm at the fastest speed possible!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the four great king realms were quite a great distance away from each other, all of them were connected by teleportation profound formations so they could travel to each other’s domain in the shortest amount of time. Furthermore, though the Eternal Heaven God Emperor had only summoned the Guardians, the Moon God Emperor had only summoned the Moon Gods, and the Brahma Heaven God Emperor had summoned both the “Brahma Gods” and the “Brahma Kings”, this was still the highest levels of power that existed within their respective king realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the terrifying devilish might the emerging Evil Infant was releasing, summoning those whose powers were weak in comparison was no more than vainly sending them to their deaths. Moreover, it was also because they were suddenly faced with the calamity of the Evil Infant that had abruptly descended on them, all of them definitely could not afford to be selfish or hold anything back… Even if it was very likely that it would result in serious losses that would harm the strength of their foundations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound transmission profound formations collapsed and dispersed, and the two great god emperors also swiftly chased after the Eternal Heaven God Emperor as they made for Star God City at the greatest possible speed.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not a single one of them had ever seen the Evil Infant Wheel of Myriad Tribulations but the name of that world destroying wheel resounded in their hearts like an irresistible, cruel curse that branded itself into their souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pitch-black wheel that had been recorded in the annals of history, the terrifying Evil Infant that was wailing and laughing… and also the one who had started everything and allowed that devil wheel to be attached to her. The Heavenly Slaughter Star God, a person they were extremely familiar with, yet at this moment, she seemed incomparably foreign to them.</span></p>

Yet every cell in his entire body was trembling uncontrollably and his four limbs had gone so weak and limp that he could not control them.</span></p>

This pitch-black bolt of lightning was also something that was beyond anyone’s knowledge. Furthermore, it was as if this bolt of black lightning had alarmed a devil god that had just been awakened from slumber as all of Jasmine’s long hair, that was now as black as night, started to dance in the air. The Evil Infant Wheel of Myriad Tribulations also released a dense black light and it was as if a devil’s eye had suddenly blinked open when Jasmine rushed toward the absolutely shocked Star God Emperor.</span></p>

This was Jasmine’s greatest secret and in this world only she knew about it. Not even Yun Che or Caizhi had been aware of this.</span></p>

His arms swiftly formed a Heavenly Origin Barrier which directly took on the full brunt of the devilish wheel in Jasmine’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Szzzzzz! The Heavenly Origin Barrier blocked the demonic wheel… But the Heavenly Origin God’s body violently shook as a mouthful of reversed blood violently surged through his internal organs that had just received a heavy injury. A long pitch-black crack had split open and spread over the Heavenly Origin Barrier, the threads of black energy that gushed out from that crack wrapped around the arms of the Heavenly Origin Star God.</span></p>

The black energy that covered his arms was as dense as a thick copse of trees. It was as if countless steel needles and hooks were gouging and ripping away at his skin, flesh, meridians, and bones, causing the features on his face to convulse in pain and terror, a terror that basically could not be resisted by willpower at all...</span></p>

He was a level nine Divine Master and the number two person in the Star God Realm, whose power was second only to the Star God Emperor himself! His Heavenly Origin Barrier was something that everyone in the Star God Realm recognized as the strongest defense. Even if it was the Star God Emperor himself, he definitely would not be able to penetrate it in such a short period of time.</span></p>

The wails and laughter of the Evil Infant resounded in every corner of the world and the demonic wheel, which possessed the might to extinguish the world, pulsed with black light as it smashed towards its owner’s birth father, the emperor of the Star Gods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Star God Emperor finally came back to his senses with much difficulty. It was already too late for him to summon his profound artifact, so with a strange roar, he thrust both his hands out and fiercely pressed them against the Evil Infant Wheel of Myriad Tribulations.</span></p>

There was only boundless gloom, coldness, resentment, hatred, and killing intent...</span></p>

His skin and flesh were being devoured layer by layer within that absolute darkness, gradually revealing his stark white fingerbones. Following that, even those fingerbones were swiftly stained by a terrifying layer of black.</span></p>

His body was the toughest and most durable divine body in the entire universe… But under that black light, it was actually turning into rotten flesh and withered bones in the blink of an eye!&nbsp;</span></p>
