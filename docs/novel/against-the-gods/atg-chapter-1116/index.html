However, the experts that were attacking the seal could feel that the formation was slowly but surely weakening bit by bit, or else they wouldn’t have combined their efforts for so long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was currently focused on the seal formation. With Yun Che’s strong concealment ability, no one discovered him getting close.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che stayed still. He swept his eyes across the group and the surroundings, carefully planning his next move. At this moment, his gaze suddenly stopped, noticing someone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was someone whose figure looked like and was close in age to himself. Yun Che noticed him as his profound strength was relatively low, only in the mid stage Sovereign Profound Realm, yet to enter the divine way. Having the qualifications to enter into this secret realm meant that one had to have a great status and be at the pinnacle of the three star realms, and this individual was by far the weakest of all that had entered. He was the only one there who had not stepped into the divine way and he stuck out like a sore thumb amidst all the experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from this, his clothing was different from the others. He wore a patterned purple robe and exuded an air of nobility. Since his profound strength was extremely low, he wasn’t near the action and was on the outskirts of the group. In front of him were over a dozen experts that had joined together into forming a defensive barrier to protect him. They would constantly turn around to check on his condition, as if worried about his safety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was pretty obvious that while his cultivation level was really low, his identity was definitely anything but ordinary. Other than the three ruling sects, no one else would have the chance to bring their disciples in to explore the Illusory Sea Ancient Realm, and if they did, they’d definitely bring their brightest and their sharpest, disciples that they’d invest their all in. For someone at the Sovereign Profound Realm to come here, let alone exploring and looking for fortuitous encounters, the most fundamental issue of surviving was an impossibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the highest likelihood for this was that this person was here to watch the excitement! After receiving the news, he specially came here to witness the opening of the underground palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To have the qualifications and the guts to do so, he had to be someone important and was related to one of the masters of the ruling sects. He could be an elder or even a direct descendant of one of the great realm kings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack!!</span></p>

They vigorously channeled their profound energy and continued their furious barrage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cracks had started to show, and they quickly started to spread. Within a short moment, shattering sounds rang out once more, and the sounds were more and more concentrated. The sealing formation stopped revolving and quickly shattered over and over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the experts gathered together in order to destroy the sealing formation and the entire group was about to witness that moment. Yun Che frowned as he had not yet thought about what his next move was… Only the three realm kings would personally enter. The rest were not pinnacle characters of the three great star realms. This was the territory of the three star realms and so the Immortal Emperor Grass would of course belong to the three great realm kings...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What method am I able to use in order to snatch away the food from these huge sharks… there’s no way to do it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following the shattering of the formation, the ground started to shake. In the group on the outskirts, that purple robed man in the Sovereign Profound Realm was also starting to show his excitement. He personally flew up, trying to get a view from up higher, but as he quickly rose, he was hurriedly stopped by the men in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master! Don’t be rash, it’s too dangerous.” His guards held him back anxiously saying, “The seal is about to break, the Island Master has said before that once the seal breaks, there will most likely be a burst of violent profound energy streams. For the sake of your safety, we should move further away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Island Master? These two words caused Yun Che to raise both his eyebrows… Island Master of the Azure Haze Realm’s Wood Sun Island—Mu Baimei?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was he Mu Baimei’s son?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That purple garbed youth broke out into laughter, “Haha, what a joke. Royal father is here, why would I be in any danger? If we retreat, won’t we be a bunch of scared mice, a joke to others?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That guard knew that he couldn’t stop him with his advice and could only shout an order to the other guards, “All of you give your greatest focus now, make sure Young Master is safe!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every those in the group of the three realm kings were all covered in perspiration. After dozens of breaths, finally a large explosion sounded, as if a mountain was crumbling into a sea. The sealing formation had completely collapsed, but pieces of the formation had yet to dissipate. The leftover energy sent flying after the collapse brought along a tremendous amount of violent explosive force as they started to disintegrate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, watch out!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group of experts closest to the epicenter retracted their power and calmly defended against the pieces. The rest of the remnant pieces were sent flying swiftly far away into the group watching the spectacle, raining a shower of violent explosions down upon them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Defend with all your might!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group started shouting. Those experts rose into the air, their palms struck out in a concerted effort, blowing away the fragments of the sealing formation. The younger experts quickly released their profound strength to defend against the fragments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were but fragments of a broken profound formation, and the bulk of it was already dissipated by the main group. For these experts, they didn’t pose much of a threat. Even if they were hit smack in the face, they would at most suffer some superficial wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But within this group of experts, there was an exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master, watch out! Arrgghh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several tens of fragments smashed downward from above the purple robed young man. All the guards in front of him used everything they had to block them for him, but after a sudden explosion, their defense was shattered and they were all sent flying. A single fragment that escaped their blockade started to fall, heading straight for the purple robed youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if death was coming down for him. Though the profound formation fragment’s energy was very weak, to the Sovereign Profound young man, it was an annihilation that he was powerless against. Just the aura from it suppressed him completely like a heavy mountain, freezing his blood. He couldn’t move at all and the only thing he could do was cry out in despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master!!”</span></p>

Mu Baimei himself was tens of kilometers away, even if he could tear through space and teleport there, he’d be unable to make it in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s eyes shone with brilliance. Several thoughts flashed through his mind and he ultimately dashed out, firing off a Phoenix Arrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!!</span></p>

Although the young man wasn’t hit directly, the force from the blast wasn’t something that he could bear and he was sent flying away violently. He fell to the ground while letting out miserable cries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Master!”</span></p>

A few others anxiously checked him for injuries.</span></p>

He landed beside the purple robed young man. It was the great realm king of the Azure Haze Realm, Island Master of the Wood Sun Island, Mu Baimei! He quickly placed his hands against the young man’s chest before his expression started to slowly calm down.</span></p>

Young Master has only suffered injuries to his left shoulder and left thigh. His internal injuries are not heavy, his injuries are definitely not life threatening. He’ll make a full recovery in at most half a month.” a leader of the guard reported to the Island Master as he made his assessment. “Luckily this man helped out, if not, I cannot… imagine the consequences.”</span></p>

No wonder… Even though he’s the son of a great realm king and has access to the best environment and resources, his profound cultivation is still so ordinary...</span></p>

You’ll be fine.” Mu Baimei seemed to be extremely fond of this son. He comforted him with a few words and then stood back up. He didn’t berate those guards who were now trembling for being inept, but headed straight towards Yun Che revealing a smile of gratitude. “Thank you, little brother, for helping just now, or else his little life would have been lost right here.”</span></p>

This man in front of him wasn’t only a senior in terms of age, he also was the ruler of a realm, a realm king. Although he had saved his son, based on Baimei’s strength and identity, this gesture would leave anyone jumping in fright.</span></p>

He looked at Yun Che with a fierce glare and shouted, “Why should I thank him? He nearly caused my death!

My son has been spoiled by his mother since he was young. He’s still green with respect to some basic courtesies. This Mu will take the place of my son, Mu Tangchun, in thanking you. With regards to today’s matter, I will definitely reward you handsomely.”</span></p>

Hurry up and send your son home to recover. If you continue to delay and he loses his life, that’d be bad. After all it’s only a tiny little stalk of Immortal Emperor Grass. How can it be compared to your treasure of a son? Don’t you agree, Sect Master Han?”</span></p>

After all, if this son dies, you can have ten more other sons. If the Immortal Emperor Grass is lost, I’m afraid you won’t even need to think about touching it ever again in this lifetime.”</span></p>

Having these qualifications should make him very famous in our three realms, but this king does not recall ever having met him. In fact, being proficient in fire attribute profound arts seems to be a rarity in our three realms.”</span></p>

It was extremely suitable for water attribute profound arts, not suited for fire attribute profound arts. In all of the three star realms, forces in the upper echelons didn’t have any fire attribute profound arts among them. It was a rarity even within the middle levels.</span></p>

His topic aroused the interest of everyone around and Han Kuan also frowned, growling, “Kid, which star realm are you from and which sect are you from?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Attracting everyone’s attention, Yun Che started to panic inside. He felt extremely stressed and as he spoke he lightly stuttered, “Greetings… Various seniors, this junior is named Ling Yun. I-I’m from the Darkya Realm.

It’s just an unrelated small matter.” Mu Baimei waved his hands. He turned to Yun Che, “Although your cultivation and qualifications aren’t ordinary, it still stands that you aren’t from any of the three star realms. Entering into this ancient secret realm is indeed not proper. However, on account that you have no malicious intents or evil machinations and furthermore saved my son’s life, we won’t pursue this matter. You should join up with the other sects and engage in your own exploration. If you have any fortuitous encounters or find any treasures, you can keep them.”</span></p>

It has probably been sealed for over a million years. If the air wasn’t turbid that’d be a surprise.” Emperor Nanlie continued, “Besides the turbid air, I’m afraid that there will also be other dangers within. Old Man Mu and Sect Master Han are all men who have sons and daughters and families. Why risk your lives for the sake of a little stalk of Immortal Emperor Grass? Just let this king enter and scout ahead.”</span></p>

There will be no snatching or fighting over it. This underground palace being able to have an Immortal Emperor Grass grow within it will definitely have other special treasures as well. Whoever obtains the Immortal Emperor Grass will not be allowed to touch any other treasures within this palace. This agreement has been witnessed by all the elders of our three sects. I’m afraid none of us will dare to lose face by betraying the agreement.”</span></p>

However, in the blink of an eye, this suppression suddenly disappeared, even his invisible state wasn’t dispelled. The only thing affected was his spirit perception, which was restricted.</span></p>

He breathed a sigh of relief and didn’t remove his invisibility. Ahead of him was all darkness. He stepped forward bit by bit on the ice cold rock beneath his feet, without a sound and not daring to light a fire to guide his way. He had spread his spirit sense to its greatest limits to sense what was around him.</span></p>

The turbid air restricted his spirit sense, which would similarly restrict the three realm kings. This provided a layer of protection for him.</span></p>

If there was only one road to the Immortal Emperor Grass, then avoiding them would be an impossibility.</span></p>

However after walking for a period of time forward, ahead of him was still a very long passageway. There was no splitting path, there wasn’t even any sign of an end. Yun Che started to feel uneasy.</span></p>

You must be very disappointed.”</span></p>

Every time I think of how I will have to let my exquisite little daughter marry to that useless son of yours, this king always feels a pain in my chest,” Emperor Nanlie replied in a sarcastic tone of voice.</span></p>

From the way they addressed each other to how they always said the opposite things, it seemed like they even harbored some animosity and malicious intent within their words towards each other but despite all this the neither of them got angry at all, as if they were used to it.</span></p>

This was because under the conditions of the turbid air, they were also being very careful as they proceeded.</span></p>

However he still didn’t dare get any closer. He slowed his pace to a crawl as he heard their voices and maintained a fixed distance from them, following right behind without a sound.</span></p>
