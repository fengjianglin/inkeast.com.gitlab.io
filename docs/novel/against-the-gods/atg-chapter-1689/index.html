Her face was as beautiful as exquisite jade and her skin was the color of cream. Her exquisite lips were as red as rubies even though she had not applied any rouge. Her bright eyes were especially eye-catching. Strange colors rippled in those clear and limpid pools, and they looked both pure and alluring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her elegant and airy robe clung to her body at her waist and the colorful and enchanting light that shone from her body clearly stated her identity.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the matter?” Chi Wuyao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Reporting to Master, something huge has happened in the Yama Realm. The Yama Barrier collapsed for no reason and the Three Yama Ancestors left the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness and publicly proclaimed Yun Che their new master. After that, the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness itself shook and black clouds filled the skies… All of these events seem to have something to do with Yun Che.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao: “...”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I was already aware of these things,” replied Chi Wuyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Jin’s voice was filled with anxiety and worry but Chi Wuyao’s voice was exceptionally calm and serene. Not a single ripple could be heard within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He had long planned to go to the Yama Realm even before we headed out to the Burning Moon Realm. He already said that there was a possibility that he could use the Eternal Calamity of Darkness to control the dark yin energy in the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness. He intended to use that to deal with the Three Yama Ancestors and coerce the Yama Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It looks like he succeeded beyond even his wildest expectations. To think that the mighty Three Yama Ancestors were willing to accept him as their master. He has yet again accomplished something that no one could even imagine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao let out a very soft laugh. “It seems like he really was holding back at that time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she observed the change in Chi Wuyao’s expression, Hua Jin could no longer hold herself back. She asked, “Master, why does it seem like you’re completely unconcerned about this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is there to worry about?” Chi Wuyao said in a relaxed voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Jin said in a worried voice, “There is one thing that we’ve confirmed, and that is the matter of the Three Yama Ancestors recognizing Yun Che as their master. Furthermore, the Three Yama Ancestors personally said that Yun Che has freed them from the Bone Sea of Eternal Darkness. This should be the main reason why they were willing to take Yun Che as their master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for what happened after that, it is clear that the Yama Realm ended up reaching a compromise with Yun Che. If Yun Che is now able to mobilize the forces of the Yama Realm…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re worried that he will use this opportunity to suppress our Soul Stealing Realm?” Chi Wuyao asked. Her voice did not falter in the slightest when she said those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Hua Jin bent her head. “Previously, Yun Che and Yun Qianying were alone and friendless in the Northern Region, but Master was willing to strike a deal with them as equals. But now, if he has truly gained full control of the Yama Realm, the full might of the forces at his disposal, which include the terrifying Three Yama Ancestors, I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, he won’t do such a thing,” Chi Wuyao replied with a faint smile. “Uniting the three king realms was always a shared goal of ours. It’s just that he has accomplished this goal with his own strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master, there’s something you’re unaware of,” Hua Jin said. “The Yama Realm swiftly closed off their borders after that and our spies were all pushed far away. It will be very hard for us to get any more information in the meantime. Right now, more than twenty hours have passed and Yun Che shows no sign of returning. In fact, he has not even sent any news back to us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao said, “Such a huge event occured, so there’s no real way to hide it. This forceful intervention is probably Yun Che’s way of sending us a message.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Hua Jin’s head jerked up in shock. “Master, since you already know about this, then why don’t you… look the least bit concerned?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi Wuyao smiled faintly and stretched out a jade hand, her delicate fingers gently brushing Hua Jin’s cherry lips. “Don’t you worry, he won’t become our enemy… He won’t ever be our enemy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Jin’s lips parted involuntarily. She did not understand where Chi Wuyao’s confidence came from, but the only thing she needed to do when it came to her master’s words was to obey them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There isn’t any need to find out what’s happening in the Yama Realm,” Chi Wuyao continued. “In fact, there’s only one thing I need you to do right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Send something over to the Yama Realm for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...What do you want me to deliver?” Hua Jin asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An invitation card.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Jin left with many misgivings in her heart. Chi Wuyao gently turned her body in the direction of the Yama Realm. Then, she let out a soft and gloomy sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the end, the will of heaven will always be stronger than the schemes of man. Everything has happened far too early.”</span></p>

Only a few people from the Imperial Heaven Realm are aware of this matter.” Yan Wu reported to Yun Che.</span></p>

The news of the Yama Realm’s dramatic transformation had not yet reached the Imperial Heaven Realm when Yan E came to get him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tian Guhu had suffered a miserable defeat to Yun Che in front of all the other Heavenly Sovereigns and notable figures of the Northern Divine Region during the Heavenly Sovereign Assembly. However, his defeat had not created any lasting trauma for Tian Guhu. On the contrary, the words that Yun Che had left him had greatly shaken his conceited beliefs.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even though Imperial Heaven Realm King Tian Muyi had great misgivings about this, he did not dare go against the summons. Instead he had been determined to follow him here and it was Tian Guhu who had persuaded him not to. So Tian Guhu had followed Yan E back to the Yama Realm by himself.</span></p>

They existed a level above the rest of them.</span></p>

Furthermore, it was a gap of superiority that the lesser person could never hope to overcome. Even with Tian Guhu’s status, it was exceedingly rare for him to see someone like the former leader of the Yama Ghosts, Yan Sangeng, much less people like the Yama Devils or the Yama Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One could only imagine how badly Tian Guhu’s heart was shaken upon seeing the fabled Yama Devils as he entered the imperial hall.</span></p>

His feet froze and his eyes widened dramatically when he saw what was before him. He could not bring himself to believe what he was seeing, no matter how hard he tried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The emperor of the Yama Realm, Yan Tianxiao.

Do you still remember me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yun… Che!” Tian Guhu’s voice trembled as he blurted out that name in shock. He checked his surroundings once more, but he still could not bring himself to believe what he was seeing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These days, the entire Northern Divine Region had been shaken by the name “Yun Che”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was the inheritor of a Devil Emperor’s legacy and he had unleashed the power of a True God to cut the Burning Moon God Emperor down in the heart of his own realm. It had been such a shocking sight that the Moon Eaters had given up without a fight… There were even rumors that he was going to be crowned emperor of the Soul Stealing Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each rumor was more shocking and unbelievable than the next… However, news of Fen Daojun’s death and the Burning Moon Realm’s surrender soon followed and these rumors became irrefutable facts. When everyone heard the news, it literally took their breath away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also this news that caused the words that Yun Che had said to Tian Guhu to reverberate in his heart more and more violently. In fact, his emotions had become so strong and intense in the last few days that he had been seized by the impulse to rush over to the Soul Stealing Realm to beg for an audience more than ten times, and had almost given in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he had never dreamed that he would get his desired meeting in the Yama Realm! He had never dreamed that he would meet Yun Che again when he was sitting on the throne that only the Yama Emperor could touch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a scene that would astound anyone, a scene that utterly boggled the mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tian Guhu,” Yun Che said with narrowed eyes, his gaze becoming exceptionally sharp. “This is such a minor occasion, but you’ve reacted in such an ugly manner. Do your so-called pride and aspirations only amount to this much?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s words were like a hammer smashing against Tian Guhu’s heart. His soul shuddered as he secretly bit down on the tip of his tongue. His mind finally regained some clarity amidst that intense pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He slowly sucked in a breath of air as he gave a solemn and respectful bow. “Imperial Heaven Realm’s Tian Guhu has come to visit the Yama Realm. It is my great honor to be able to see Senior Yun, the Yama Emperor, and all of the Yama Devils.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che did not reply. Instead, he slowly got to his feet and began walking in his direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he stood up, the Three Yama Ancestors hurriedly followed behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tian Guhu had never seen the three stooped and ugly old men behind Yun Che before, but when he looked at them… just when he looked at them, he felt his soul go numb as it soundlessly quaked. It was as if an invisible claw had seized him so tightly that he could not even hope to struggle free, a claw that only needed an instant to consign him to the eternal abyss of death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had only felt such a sensation when he had paid a visit to the Yama Emperor all those years ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Given his current cultivation, his mind was far stronger than it had been before. Yet the three old men behind Yun Che made him feel the same frightening sensation he had felt back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tian Guhu’s incredible astonishment had caused his body to tremble all over, an action that he was entirely incapable of controlling. However, he forced himself to stand up straight as he fiercely fought to keep his gaze calm and aloof… He was well aware that a piece of trash that would sink to his knees due to the other person’s aura would never be respected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard that you gave yourself the name Tian Guhu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che walked toward him. When he finally spoke again, he was only a few steps away from Tian Guhu. “You were infuriated by the fact that everyone around you was content to be trapped inside this prison. They either lived dispirited lives or sought to kill one another for personal gain. Not only did they have no determination to defy their fate, they were even active participants in digging their own grave. A grave that was already as deep as an abyss.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tian Guhu’s heart was violently shaken by those words. He slowly nodded his head as he replied, “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But… what did these high-minded aspirations amount to? I, Tian Guhu, am not only alone in these aspirations, but I am also nothing more than a piece of trash who can’t even cause a single ripple as the Northern Divine Region tumbles toward its inevitable fate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re very self-aware.” Yun Che said coolly. “No matter how high-minded your aspirations are, they will be nothing more than a fatuous joke if you do not possess sufficient power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Tian Guhu clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, I will give you an opportunity.” Yun Che gave him a deep look as he said those words. “I can give you power that exceeds your father’s, but I have one condition. I want you to become the spear that breaks out of the cage that is the Northern Divine Region, a spear that will pierce into the three other divine regions… A spear that can break at any instant. Do you dare to accept this condition?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tian Guhu was utterly stunned by those words. For a moment, he even suspected his hearing had gone awry. “What did… you say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t need to doubt my words or worry whether I can accomplish what I said or not. You only need to give me one answer. Do you ‘dare’, or do you ‘not dare’?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yama Ancestors were behind him and the Yama Emperor and his Yama Devils formed a ring around them. Yun Che’s every word evoked a spiritual pressure that was no less heavy than the might of a god emperor. They brooked no suspicion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Tian Guhu’s mind swam in confusion, but his will and beliefs had received an incredibly violent blow. He practically spoke without thinking when he gave his reply, “This is something I have dreamed of my entire life, an opportunity that I’ve been begging for. Why… wouldn’t… I… dare!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Very good.” Yun Che praised him in a cold and calm voice. After that, his brows suddenly sank. “Restrain him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he gave that order, the Three Yama Ancestors immediately appeared around Tian Guhu. They simultaneously released their power, instantly forcing Tian Guhu to his knees. His power had been utterly suppressed and he could not even move a single muscle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tian Guhu had the strength to fight against level ten Divine Sovereigns despite only being a level seven Divine Sovereign, but he was nothing more than a pitiful worm in front of a Yama Ancestor.</span></p>
