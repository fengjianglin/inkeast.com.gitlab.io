But you’re the one who doesn’t understand what exactly she means to me… You will never be able to understand!”</span></p>

The Yun Che in front of her was like a despairing wild beast which had been locked inside a cage of darkness, a wild beast that was using its own fresh blood and its very life to roar and struggle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without Jasmine, Yun Che would merely have been a useless cripple who had been chased out of his own clan, who had received an endless amount of cold stares, and who did not even have the power to protect his own family members. So was what he felt towards Jasmine gratitude? No it was not… It definitely was not. The feelings he had for Jasmine were very strange and marvelous, they were different from every other woman who had entered his life, and he wasn’t able to put those feelings into words. But it was these inexplicable feelings, which bound his heart and soul, that caused him to chase her to the God Realm. It was these feelings that allowed him to go from someone who had not even entered the divine way to the Eastern Divine Region’s Conferred God Number One in the short span of three years… All for the sake of meeting her again.</span></p>

He was well aware of the fact that these thoughts would be viewed as incorrigibly stupid by anyone else. But, in his life, in his two lives in fact, he had never been as resolute and determined as he was right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master,” He Ling stepped forward and softly sank to her knees in front of Shen Xi, “I beg you… Let him go.”</span></p>

She turned around, her back facing the two people as she slowly closed her eyes.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che’s struggles froze for a moment. He had gone to the Star God Realm but the last time he went, he had arrived there via the Eternal Heaven God Realm’s profound teleportation formation. So he did not know where the Star God Realm actually was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Xi stretched out a hand and as she pointed a finger, a small cluster of white flew out and entered the space between Yun Che’s brows. Immediately the location of the Star God Realm was clearly imprinted into Yun Che’s soul.</span></p>

You are free to do as you desire. I can advise but I don’t have any authority to stop you… Since you have made this choice, then go.”</span></p>

After he found his footing, he did not leave immediately. Instead he stood there with a dumbfounded look on his face as he stared dazedly at Shen Xi’s back… and he did so for a very long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He slowly walked forward and he lightly hugged Shen Xi from behind after that.</span></p>

A beam of dense moonlight exploded outwards in the sky and the Vanishing Moon Celestial palace transformed into a streaking trail of starlight as it vanished into the distant horizon.</span></p>

He Ling’s existence and words were undoubtedly the greatest companionship and consolation to the current him right now. It was just that he understood that the debt that he owed her would never be able to be repaid in this life.</span></p>
