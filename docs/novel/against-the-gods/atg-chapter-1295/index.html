 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che never stopped grinding his teeth as he swore at Qianye Ying’er. This was only the second time that he had met this woman, but he was already hating her unlike any other woman he had ever encountered in his life. He had never been this powerless either… In the past, no matter how despairing the situation had looked, he had always been capable of making a desperate gambit even against someone like the Moon Slaughter Devil Sovereign. But… the gap between Qianye Ying’er and him was just too wide, so wide that even the distance between the sky and the earth made a poor comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All words and tactics were nothing more than a joke before a gap like this.</span></p>

She slowly turned around to look at him before asking, “Yun Che, are you sure you understand what a fate worse than death, means?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A demonic, golden light flashed in her pupils, and dense golden patterns appeared all over Yun Che’s body. Then, he shuddered violently as he felt something like a million arrows piercing his body, or innumerable needles penetrating his soul…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“AH!!!!”</span></p>

It was because the wounds he had suffered were unimaginable to common folk. There were many times he was badly wounded or on his deathbed, but he was so used to pain that he never uttered a single sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the moment the golden light had flashed across Qianye Ying’er’s eyes, he had screamed like he was crying blood and writhed until his body looked completely deformed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“EGAAAAAAAHHHH…”</span></p>

There were almost no breaks between the screams at all. Anyone who heard them would’ve felt chilled from the bottom of their hearts, wondering what kind of pain the screamer was suffering from to scream as terribly as they did...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s throat was completely hoarse. His face was utterly bloodless. He felt as if countless poisonous thorns or blades were stabbing or carving pieces out of his flesh and soul, and the pain they inflicted was hundreds or thousands of times worse than being tortured, or being torn limb from limb by way of execution...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His soul had plunged to the depths of the abyss, but his body still couldn’t move an inch from its spot. His body shivered violently like a dying worm, and he was drenched from head to toe in cold sweat in just a few breaths’ time… A pool of sweat was spreading at a shockingly fast rate beneath his body...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Xia Qingyue closed her eyes, eyebrows trembling with pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qianye Ying’er showed no signs of discomfort or pity despite Yun Che screaming like his heart and lungs were being torn out of his body. In fact, her beautiful lips—a pair of things that were prettier than even a delicate flower—curled into a delightful smile. “Do you understand what a fate worse than death really means now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Demon… ness… AAAAH…”</span></p>

The word he uttered—unrecognizable because his voice was completely gone—was only two syllables long, and yet it had him using nearly all of his remaining willpower to utter it. After that, his screams had only gotten louder and more painful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Qianye Ying’er narrowed her eyes, “You still can speak? That’s truly praiseworthy. What about… this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her pupils flashed golden once more, and the golden patterns covering Yun Che’s body grew even brighter and clearer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH——”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bloodcurdling scream instantly became ten times stronger than it was before, spreading to nearly every corner of the starting location. It was so terrible that even the clouds in the sky, and the dust on the ground, seemed to be trembling in response to his pain. Yun Che could clearly feel every nerve, every vein and every wisp of his soul being pierced, stretched, twisted and torn apart by innumerable cold blades...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a kind of pain that even Yun Che could neither imagine nor endure...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was literally destroying his own throat and coughing blood every time he screamed. His entire body, his very cells were shaking violently due to the sheer amount of pain that was being inflicted on him. His blood vessels swelled like bulging worms, as if tens of thousands of worms were wriggling just beneath his skin...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark… no one who had not experienced the curse could ever imagine how terrible it really was, nor know of the true eighteen hells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che had always been proud of his firm willpower, and both his body and soul had been tempered by countless cruel trials in the past. He hadn’t backed down even when he was tormented by the Netherworld Udumbara Flower he plucked for Jasmine...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, he actually wished he was dead just so that he could escape this inhumane torture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you still speak now? No?” Even the hardest person would’ve felt pity for someone who was in this much pain, but Qianye Ying’er’s half smile showed that she wasn’t moved by the sight before her in the slightest. “Do you know why it’s called the Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s because it’s a curse that’ll make you marvel over the wonder that is death. It makes you want death more than anything else in your life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The pain it brings is something that transcends the soul. In short, it isn’t something that can be resisted with one’s will at all. So forget that you’re just a pitiful junior who has lived for several dozen years, even a realm king or a king realm’s god emperor would’ve knelt on their knees and begged for mercy, or death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You must be wanting to die so very much, aren’t you? Did you suddenly come to realize that death is the most wonderful thing in this world?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“UGAAH… AAAAH… AAAAAH!” The only answer Yun Che could give her was a guttural, bloody scream. His facial features had become completely distorted by pain, and his twitching fingers looked like the languished claws of an animal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“By the way,” Qianye Ying’er continued to speak leisurely, “The Brahma Soul Death Wishing Mark is a curse mark that I’ve planted with my soul origin, so…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She smiled. “You’ll never be free from this curse unless I release you of my own accord, or die. Not even your foster father the Dragon Monarch, or ten Dragon Monarchs can release you from this pain!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This means that you have only three choices left in your life now: You either obey me, beg for someone to kill you… or stay at the bottom of this hell and lead a life worse than death for eternity!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood poured down Yun Che’s gritted teeth like a fountain. His pupils were widened so much that they looked like they could burst open any moment… Qianye Ying’er’s words were like the cruelest, most demonic curse that imprinted itself deeply in his heart and soul. Every bit of willpower and belief he had ever had was flooded by the abyss of pain until it all turned into despairing darkness...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, Yun Che stopped screaming and fainted completely. Blood was still pouring down the corner of his lips, however.</span></p>

It’ll be too noisy to conduct our business otherwise.”</span></p>

Her pupils had somehow vanished completely, and all that was left was… a disturbing canvas of ice and darkness.</span></p>

Is that so?” But Xia Qingyue’s terrifying eyes failed to make Qianye Ying’er back down in the slightest. On the contrary, Qianye Ying’er moved closer and stared at the former with interest. Then, she started caressing Qingyue’s naked upper body with creepy tenderness, “Relax, I’m not going to kill you. It’d be a shame to destroy a body such as yours, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>

Her impossibly beautiful body was finally exposed to the thick, heavy air of the God Realm of Absolute Beginning.</span></p>

She praised as she traced her delicate fingers across Xia Qingyue’s perfect legs, “What a perfect pair of legs you have. I doubt there can be another pair like yours even if every perfect jade in the world were used to carve something equal to this. I bet that any man would be willing to carry them on their shoulders and play with them to their heart’s content, even if they would die by a thousand cuts tomorrow.”</span></p>

To her, it was the most basic kind of common sense.</span></p>

From the moment a shade of her beauty had made its appearance, she was showered with countless looks of wonderment, yearning, and lust. The geniuses, proud sons, realm kings, sons of god emperors, and even the god emperors themselves thought that her beauty triumphed every other that existed in the world, and they were willing to discard everything—even their pride and lives—just to win a smile or a glance for her.</span></p>

The common folk thought she covered up her face to prevent more people from succumbing to her beauty, but in reality… she simply thought that the men of this world no longer deserved to catch even a glimpse of her face.</span></p>
