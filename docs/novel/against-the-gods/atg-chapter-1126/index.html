For a whole ten thousand years only two people were permitted entry. One was Mu Xuanyin, with the other being Mu Bingyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Immortal Lake was like an icy prison but since ancient times it had never frozen over. The surface of the lake was filled with several beautiful rotating ice lotuses. A wondrous, beautiful chilly mist was all around. A gentle breeze blew in from outside the ice windows. Water ripples and their reflections could be seen across the crystal clear surface. The reflections of the ice and water were like an icy pure jade, making even the snow lotuses pale in comparison to the luster of the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ice door was pushed open and Mu Bingyun slowly stepped in. She saw Mu Xuanyin lifting up her face, allowing a few drops of water to slowly trickle across her beautiful immortal-like face. They looked like shiny pearls rolling across her perfect skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Profound practitioners could use their profound powers to clean themselves, even more so those already in the divine way. However Mu Xuanyin always loved to take baths, and Mu Bingyun knew it. Perhaps this would allow her heart to maintain its calm and clarity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big sister, why have you summoned me?” Mu Bingyun gently asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her jadelike shoulders slowly moving, Mu Xuanyin slowly stood up. The mist and the water around her made it look like they were ornaments around a piece of beautiful jade, “Bingyun, how is the recovery of your profound strength going?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“About ninety percent,” Mu Bingyun replied. “In a few more months, I’ll be completely recovered.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s good.” Mu Xuanyin’s voice was soft and gentle, “For the coming period of time, I’ve decided to focus my all on teaching Yun Che. With his current state, wanting to depend on himself to enter the Profound God Convention is an impossibility. Matters relating to the sect within and without will be handed over to you. You’ve been travelling for the last thousand years, and now that you’ve gained a rebirth, it’s time for you to get familiar with sect matters once more. As for disciples who will take part in the Profound God Convention, you can give Huanzhi full control over that matter, he doesn’t need to consult you on anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Bingyun gently nodded her head and softly said, “Big sister, you’ve really… just forgiven Yun Che like that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If not, what else can I do?” Mu Xuanyin squinted. “He did brave death to charge into the Ancient God Burying Inferno Prison to save my life. Should I just slap him dead?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bingyun</span> kept silent for a long while and then slowly replied, “This is definitely for the best. I just didn’t think that with your personality…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She stopped herself midway, hurriedly continuing, “Big sister, have you decided to raise Yun Che up as the next sect master?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Mu Xuanyin gently shook her head. “His heart is not here at all. When I took him in as my disciple I already knew this fact.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then you…”</span></p>

Her lips parted into a slightly cheeky smile which made the light in the entire crystalline surroundings seem to grow dim, “Bingyun, do you think I should dual cultivate with that brat? If not for him, big sister’s precious ice phoenix vital yin would have been atrociously wasted.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...Big sister, you’re being mischievous again.” Mu Bingyun remained unfazed. “Since you’ve already decided to forgive Yun Che, you should forgive him completely and not bring up that incident any longer. And you shouldn’t suddenly regret it at any future point. As for what you’ve instructed, I’ll inform Huanzhi.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“On your way, get him to also send out three hundred Divine Hall disciples to the extreme ice ocean. I want them to bring back at least a thousand pieces of Snow Song Ice Crystals,” Mu Xuanyin instructed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Bingyun was slightly stunned, then she realized something and said, “Looks like big sister is personally going to refine the Universe Penta Jade Pellet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After leaving the Ice Phoenix Sacred Hall, Mu Bingyun’s footsteps suddenly stopped. She lifted her head, her eyes had a little bit of complexity in them. As she looked at the falling snow she muttered to herself, “She’s changed…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Her divine soul had such a sudden violent awakening… is this because of Yun Che…?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Eastern Divine Region’s greatest event of all time with countless famous young profound practitioners taking part. These were the future rulers and overlords of the Eastern Divine Region, and this was the first time in all of history that they could enter the Eternal Heaven Pearl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t only a grand event for young profound practitioners, the entire Eastern Divine Region could be said to be looking forward to this. The four great king realms had jointly organized this and made this event available realm wide. Those who were of extraordinary birth, those with world shocking talent, all hoped to be among the thousand names of the young profound practitioners. Their hearts fervently burned with crazed excitement and passion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vast Eastern Divine Region had become a lot quieter. All were sparing no expense and spending all their efforts to raise up their disciples with the qualifications to enter the Profound God Convention. It seemed like each and every sect was focused on that right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Song Realm was the same.</span></p>

The sect had expanded a great amount of resources, not being stingy at all. However, during this period of time, no one in the sect had seen Yun Che or heard any news of their sect master.</span></p>

Especially with respect to a nation’s development. As Yun Che had killed Xuanyuan Wentian, the four sacred grounds had bowed their heads to him. And Yun Che’s wife was the head of Blue Wind Nation. Once the weakest nation in the continent, Blue Wind Nation had become so strong that it was almost unbelievable in just a short three years.</span></p>

One would usually need the protection of a profound practitioner so few people travelled this road. But right now a young man and young woman were walking along side by side on the road with their backs facing the sunset, their eyes filled with the brilliant light of excitement.</span></p>

Although she was in plain garments, she was beautiful beyond measure. She had a perky behind and ample breasts. Her eyes were especially beautiful, far more gorgeous than the moon that shone in dark night. She held both her hands in front of her chest, her face a picture of excitement. Although she was now quite a distance away from New Moon City, she was still as excited as ever.</span></p>

New Moon City was burned down by Phoenix flames and New Moon Profound Palace was completely destroyed. What we’ve seen should have been rebuilt after that.”</span></p>

He looked around sixty percent similar to her. He was neither tall nor bulky but he had a solemn and silent steadiness about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing the words of the young man, the girl pouted, clearly disatisfied, “You’re being a killjoy again. I won’t hear any of this. Anyways, this is a place where Big Brother benefactor once lived in! There are so many statues of him, it’s just that those statues are so ugly. Big Brother Benefactor is a hundred times better looking.”</span></p>

There are legends told about him everywhere. I thought that I myself had become powerful enough, that I could repay him…”</span></p>

He must have come across countless people and experienced even more numerous events. We were so little at that time, and also so weak. We’re probably the least eye catching of all of those whom he has helped and it’s been more than ten years, how could he still remember?”</span></p>

She said softly, “I don’t care if he doesn’t remember us, I just want to see him one more time. I’ve worked so hard all these years just so that I could see Big Brother Benefactor sooner… I wonder where he is right now.”</span></p>

Everyone has been saying that Big Brother Benefactor has not appeared for several years. Some say that he’s in the distant Illusory Demon Realm, while some say that he’s out and about travelling while training. There are even some rumors that he has ascended to an even higher level of world…” the youth shook his head, “I also don’t know where to look for him and even if I did… I’m not sure if it’d be considering disturbing him.”</span></p>

In Blue Wind Nation, those able to fly across the skies were few and far between and so this was particularly eye catching. With their eyesight they could see the red figure clearly.</span></p>

Upon seeing the duo, starlight which contained the entire world’s magnificence shone within her eyes. “You are… Feng Zu’er and Feng Xian’er?”</span></p>
