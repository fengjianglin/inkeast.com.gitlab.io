However, as it shattered, no profound energy seemed to be found about its pieces. It was as if the entire star formation had been completely annihilated. The star formation slowly dissipated into nothingness, as if entering an unknown void.</span></p>

She looked into the distance and giggled, “This is good. Hehe, I’m seriously too smart… Time to play, yay!”</span></p>

Shielded behind was Wu Guike whose body was jelly-like from fear. That incomparably frightening suppression wasn’t something that he could bear.</span></p>

He didn’t dare to believe it. He recalled that terrifying name which surfaced within his memories, waves of shock thrashing in his soul.</span></p>

He looked forward and saw Lei Qianfeng’s “frightened out of their wits” group. He slowly muttered vicious words, “Silence them!”</span></p>

They didn’t seem to have suffered any visible injuries but they had now lost their lives.</span></p>

Wanting to find the Nine Star Divine Buddha Jade and the Immortal Emperor Grass before the Profound God Convention was going to be an impossible feat. Comparatively, training within this time span of two years and hoping to reach the Divine Tribulation Realm, though hopes were dim, it was his one and only option left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Ruyan had arranged a training room for him that was strongly isolated from the outside world. It was incomparably quiet. Inside here, he could focus on training peacefully with all his heart, however after a while, after closing and opening his eyes countless times, he was still unable to calm himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had only one objective when he followed Mu Bingyun to the God Realm and that was to see Jasmine again.</span></p>

His heart was filled with endless gratitude, and at the same time he couldn’t repay the favor that she had showed him. Instead.... He could only pathetically escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t dare to see her another time, not knowing what the consequences would be. However, every time he thought of her voice and face, he was worried that she still hadn’t regained clarity, and that her injuries hadn’t gotten better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And He Lin who had died in his arms.... Their friendship was clearly a short lived one, but his death, those tears at the end, his words and that worry… It was like a heavy weight on his conscience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had wanted to look for Jasmine, search for He Lin’s sister, and even had countless thoughts of passing by the Snow Song Realm just to find a way to apologize and make it up to Mu Xuanyin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hoo!” He let out a deep breath. Yun Che opened his eyes and looked up. He was in quietness for a day, yet the expression in his eyes was still that of turmoil, he seemed totally in a daze, “Jasmine… How do I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir Ling Yun, may I come in?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A soft and gentle voice travelled in from the outside. Yun Che stood up and opened the door. He saw Ji Ruyan standing there, red with excitement and looking incredibly elated. He curiously asked, “Miss Ruyan, what happened?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Soul Sect…” Ji Ruyan was panting a little, “The Soul Sect’s… Completely… Finished!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...?” Yun Che frowned “What are you… saying? What happened to the Soul Sect?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Ruyan gently took in a few breaths and then regained her composure, “We just received news from the main branch of the Soul Sect. Something incredibly strange happened. A large blue light enveloped the entire Soul Sect, and then afterwards, everyone within the Soul Sect, from disciples to elders, within ten breaths of time had their profound strengths crippled!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che’s eyebrows jumped. He confirmed that it was the truth through Ji Ruyan’s expression and voice, “How could this even happen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Ruyan continued, “I didn’t believe it at first, but father and I went personally to verify this. It’s one hundred…. No…. a thousand percent true. My father even discovered the corpse of Lei Qianfeng in front of the Black Soul Mountain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...Then what about those from the Divine Martial Realm?” Yun Che frowned, still unable to process this news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The main sect had over eight million members He had once used Moon Splitting Cascade to enter, its size was huge and teeming with experts. All of them were at the top of the Darkya Realm… The horrifying thing was… They had actually all had their profound strength crippled?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an absolutely unbelievable and incomprehensible fairytale!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Divine Martial Realm members weren’t there. It seems like they’ve already left. Also…” Ji Ruyan’s eyes sparkled, “This sort of thing happening, the only possibility is that the Great Realm King of the Divine Martial Realm did this to the Soul Sect because of his anger over the issue of the Royal Wood Spirit. Sir Ling Yun’s understanding of the Wood Spirits is perhaps still quite superficial, however their use to existences such as the Divine Martial Realm Great Realm King is extremely beneficial. Knowing that the Soul Sect managed to capture a Royal Wood Spirit would drive him mad with glee, but losing the Royal Wood Spirit would drive him mad with rage, and it wouldn’t be any sort of ordinary rage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This point, Yun Che didn’t find it strange. That day within the wood spirit secret realm, Qing Mu, who had given his wife’s Wood Spirit Orb to him, had personally said that the one responsible for massacring the Royal Wood Spirits, particularly He Lin’s parents, was the greatest existence within the Eastern Divine Region—the Brahma Monarch God Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the king realms were like this, let alone the Divine Martial Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After receiving He Lin’s Royal Wood Spirit Orb, he was now clearer than anyone else on why they were so coveted.</span></p>

They definitely don’t even consider the Soul Sect anything of worth. In his anger, the Divine Martial Realm King could even wipe out the entire Soul Sect. Being able to cripple the profound strength of so many within such a short period of time… If it’s the Divine Martial Realm, they can definitely do it, and that’s the only possibility.”</span></p>

This was because it wasn’t just about the annihilation of the Soul Sect, this was about the thousands of years that the Black Feather Merchant Guild was being suppressed under the thumb of the Soul Sect, unable to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Falling deeper and deeper into an abyss, they had finally seen a ray of sunlight. This wasn’t just a cause for celebration, this was literally a chance for rebirth that the heavens gave them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir Ling Yun, the Soul Sect suffering such harsh punishment from the Divine Martial Realm, and right now being on the brink of destruction is all thanks to your efforts.” Ji Ruyan lifted her head and her gaze held a deep gratitude, “If it wasn’t for you snatching that little wood spirit out of their hands, we would not have today. Our Black Feather Merchant Guild would also have not been able to escape from their clutches. Ruyan, and the entire Black Feather Merchant Guild, will forever remember this great grace you’ve given to us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Yun Che’s expression tightened, not reacting to Ji Ruyan’s subsequent response. After a while he started to mumble to himself, “Crippling the profound strength of over eight million people at once, furthermore a large portion of them were Divine Realm experts. The difficulty, the amount of energy expanded… Has to be much much more than just outright killing them. Doing things this way leaves several loose ends. Since he was in such a rage, why not just kill all of them? Why spend so much effort just to waste their profound cultivations?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Ruyan replied, “Perhaps, the Divine Martial Realm didn’t want to be too extreme, after all, Lei Qianfeng’s sister is the concubine of the Divine Martial Realm King.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then why was Lei Qianfeng killed? You also mentioned before that two members of the Divine Martial Realm came, one of them was even Wu Guike. How is it possible that the Divine Martial Realm would finally decide to kill Lei Qianfeng?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This…” Ji Ruyan didn’t have a good explanation for this. “Although this defies logic, the result is so. The only one who could do this is the Divine Martial Realm. Escorting Wu Guike should have been a Divine Sovereign. This rank of an expert is more than enough to kill Lei Qianfeng without killing the rest of the sect members and just crippling their cultivation. Perhaps this was his intention all along.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s hatred of Lei Qianfeng ran deep. He had spent a huge effort and taken several life threatening risks in order to force him into a dead end, however the arrival of the Divine Martial Realm had caused his efforts to come to naught. He never would have expected for this result, but right now, instead of feeling happy, he had even more doubts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the situation like in the Soul Sect currently? Are there alot of people gathered there?” Yun Che suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Ruyan shook her head, “Father intentionally spread the news, however due fear of the Divine Martial Realm, no one dares to go near, even the various branch sects of the Soul Sect have sealed themselves. All of them are in peril, no one dares go near the main sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is Lei Qianfeng’s corpse still there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, and it’s very much intact.” Ji Ruyan suddenly felt some misgivings, “Sir Ling Yun?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The main sect is completely finished. Even though there are a large number of branch sects, with all the hatred and enmity accumulated by the Soul Sect throughout the years, they should be at a dead end. This is their well deserved retribution.” Yun Che stated, “Whether it was the Divine Martial Realm that was responsible isn’t important, I also can’t be bothered to move against the Soul Sect now, but one thing is for certain… I want to take away Lei Qianfeng’s corpse!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Ruyan was shocked, and slowly replied, “Of course that isn’t a problem. I’ll immediately send a transmission to father to prevent anyone from getting close to the location where Lei Qianfeng’s corpse is located.”</span></p>

Falling from the heavens to hell was without a doubt a nightmare that they wouldn’t be able wake from. With all the evil deeds that they’ve committed throughout the years in the Darkya Realm, their future fate was certain.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground here wasn’t level, as if a tornado had swept through it. Lei Qianfeng’s body was particularly eye catching. Beside him were also several Soul Sect members. From their clothing, their positions in the Soul Sect were definitely not low, but they were the same as Lei Qianfeng, not a breath of life left in them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che landed and looked coldly upon Lei Qianfeng. The Darkya Great Realm King, who had once nearly forced him into a dead end, now looked as if he didn’t die a peaceful death. Both of his eyes were wide open, as if filled with regrets. His eyes didn’t show any fear or horror, but held an emptiness within, as if the moment he died, he had felt an immense amount of hopelessness. Before his body had even died, his soul had already gone before it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lei Qianfeng, it’s time you face those innocent wood spirits and account for your crimes!” Yun Che growled. He stretched out his arm and violently lifted up Lei Qianfeng’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ding!</span></p>

Yun Che looked down and saw a purple dimensional ring. It had fallen from Lei Qianfeng’s body. It was apparently his belongings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was the Darkya Realm King. His dimensional ring would definitely hold a large amount of profound stones and rare treasures. Yun Che stretched out his hand and pulled the ring into it. He swept it with his sense and then paused in shock.</span></p>

The other two, one was as small as an dragon eye fruit, it released a strange treasure like light, the larger one was grayish white in color, it looked like an extremely ordinary stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che quizzically brought out these four stones. Lei Qianfeng was an extremely rich guy, why would there only just be four stones within?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He first lifted that grayish white stone. Yun Che inserted some profound energy and tried to inspect it, but his profound energy was immediately cut off and he was unable to investigate any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s eyebrows jumped in surprise, this ordinary looking rock was definitely something extraordinary.</span></p>

Yun Che then lifted up the glowing jade stone. Its glow wasn’t strong, it was peaceful and comforting. When he saw it, it involuntarily reminded him of beautiful stars filling the dark night sky. He inserted some profound energy into it, and a name surfaced in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s hand began to shake as he cried out, “Divine Nine Star Buddha Jade!!”</span></p>
