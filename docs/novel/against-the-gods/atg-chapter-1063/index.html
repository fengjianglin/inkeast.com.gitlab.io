 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How did he get there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the Vermillion Bird projection, Yun Che’s figure actually showed up. Even more surprising was the fact that he had appeared in a place filled with the power of a Divine Master dragon. Even Yan Wancang and Yan Juehai would’ve been severely injured or killed outright in a short time if they went to that place… but somehow Yun Che was still alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before anyone could react, they saw Yun Che brazenly raising a sword and meeting the furious draconic flames of the ancient horned dragon head on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like the scene of a tiny ant raising its arms to resist the entire sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, it was impossible for Mu Xuanyin to meet the ancient horned dragon’s power head on even if she was alone, not to mention that she had to protect Yun Che right now. The only two conclusions of this clash were either they perish together or she withdraw her power and scrape an escape on her lonesome… But when she saw Yun Che risking his life to make his way towards her, she instinctively poured more energy into Yun Che’s body despite her blurring consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The deadly draconic attack surged closer and closer… but in the next moment, just before it could envelop the duo entirely, the attack’s power, aura, might and even heat vanished in an instant. Not a trace of the attack could be seen anywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was almost as if it had been transferred entirely to a silent world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“AOOOOO!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A furious and obviously pained dragon roar resounded through the air. Mu Xuanyin immediately turned around to find the shocking sight of an ancient horned dragon flipping backwards in recoil. The innumerable wounds that riddled the dragon’s body instantly burst under pressure and caused dragon blood to spray everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uuuaaahhhhh!?!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wha… what is that!?!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone—from sect masters to disciples—standing before the Vermillion Bird projection shouted at the top of their lungs as if they were struck by heavenly thunder, eyes bulging so wide and so rapidly in absolute shock that their eyeballs nearly burst out of their sockets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because they could clearly see that the ancient horned dragon had thrown a calamitous swipe that could burn even a Divine Sovereign to dust, at Yun Che and Mu Xuanyin. But just as the attack touched Yun Che’s gigantic sword, the dragon was suddenly sent flying away, rolling, roaring in pain and bleeding all over the place… it obviously suffered a grievous wound in that one instant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Yun Che and the Mu Xuanyin on the point of demise… were perfectly unharmed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What… what… what…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd had never distrusted their eyes so much until today. A large majority of these people had lived over ten thousand years but despite adding up the most ridiculous rumors they’d heard and the most ridiculous scenes they’d seen in their life together, the culmination was still not even one ten thousandth as ridiculous as what they’d just seen today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancient horned dragon was a Divine Master. It was the most powerful existence in the long history of the Flame God Realm since hundreds of thousands of years ago. Harming the ancient horned dragon with a single sword strike was absolutely impossible even if there were ten of Yan Wancang, the strongest human in the Flame God Realm… but somehow, Yun Che did just that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It… it worked!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che madly roared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the most direct expressions of the Heretic God Arts’ strength was its ridiculous amplification of a cultivator’s profound energy after a gate was opened. It was also the power Yun Che relied on the most to defeat opponents with far greater profound strength than him. However, the true reason behind the Heretic God Arts’ greatness lay on its core ability to ignore or even go against the laws of the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The impossible amplification of profound energy was something beyond the boundaries of normal laws to begin with. The terrible Ice Flame he created by merging fire and ice was also a power that was outside the boundaries of laws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Falling Moon Sinking Star of the Heretic Soul gate, Sealing Cloud Locking Sun of the Burning Heart gate and Destroying Sky Decimating Earth of the Purgatory gate were definitely incredibly powerful skills but they weren’t so powerful that they literally reversed the laws of nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moon Star Restoration of Rumbling Heaven gate was different, however. For the first time, the Heretic God Arts’ outstanding ability of reversing the laws of nature was revealed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Moon Star Restoration was fully executed, the law and order of all powers within the affected area were reversed completely. This also meant that all powers in contact with Moon Star Restoration would be reversed in an instant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore… it was an instant counter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also a full counter. Because the skill was based on the power to rewrite the law and order of nature, the strength and shape of the powers involved were completely irrelevant. Everything would be reversed completely as long as Moon Star Restoration was executed in full, no matter the level or the form of the power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only thing that could stop it was a power that could also cause havoc on the laws of nature like the Heretic God’s power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, since the Heretic God’s Fourth Style heavily interfered with the laws of nature, it was also treated as a breach of the heavenly law! The heavens punished all who forcefully use such skills without exception, so Yun Che was bound to suffer terrible consequences for his transgression...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The consequence of using Moon Star Restoration was a severe reduction of lifespan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also why Yun Che had never used Moon Star Restoration even though he had been able to barely activate Rumbling Heaven for a long time already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the ancient horned dragon’s destructive flames touched the Heaven Smiting Sword, all of its power was instantly reflected back to the ancient horned dragon like light reflecting off a mirror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So the feat of reflecting a Divine Master beast’s attack by a Divine Origin profound practitioner was achieved… it was a miracle that only the power of the Heretic God could achieve in the entire vast and chaotic history of the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because the ancient horned dragon was in a berserk state, it injected all of its fury and power into every one of its attacks. Before the ambush, it was already covered in wounds during the long hours it fought against Mu Xuanyin. Therefore, the reflected attack was without a doubt a nightmare it had planted with its own hands.</span></p>

 <p>With my internet and work somewhat better than it used to be a few weeks ago, I have been able to take the time to read the feedback received personally instead of hearing it second hand. I have seen some complaints in the comments when I denote a chapter that isn't fully double the English word count being considered a double chapter. I have answered some of them, but I figured I needed to put it in a place where everyone would be able to see it so I don't have to repeat myself again.</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p style="margin-right: 0; text-indent: 0">Recent chapters have become longer than usual in the raw text and this chapter, although not directly double the length of normal chapters, is pretty much close to it. This kind of thing is noted by my editor who then forwards this to me, who acknowledges this fact.&nbsp;</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>The above is an answer I gave to a reader who mentioned something about it, but it is not just that. For those who believe it to be shameless because they think I am just trying to put it a double so we do less chapters per week, wrong, I've been doing my best to get out the 7/week release with my shippy internet. 7 chapters as in seven full chapters, so you aren't receiving less than what we can manage to do. For those who believe it to be scummy because they think I am trying to make a chapter a double so that we have one less chapter to catch up to, wrong, because this has been going on since the very start of the series and looking back on it, sometimes we didn't even count chapters as doubles when we should've. To me, what's truly scummy is if I don't indicate which chapter is considered a double, but if that's what you guys want, then I won't bother giving you guys notice since the only real reason I bother to tell you guys whether a chapter is considered a double or not is to let you all know that we are trying our best to catch up to the chapters missed, even if we're not there yet. And lastly, for those of you who wondered why we do not count some chapters as .5 or .75 of a normal chapter if we count some as double chapters, have you guys actually seen more than 5, or even 3, short chapters of ATG in 1000 chapters? I could be wrong, but I can only think of two chapters that was shorter than the norm. One was released back in the age of dinosaurs when ATG started off with a release of 3 chapters a week and I didn't even bother to count the other one as a single chapter, let alone .75.</p>
 <p>On a happier note, there may be a potential translator joining ATG soon. Fingers crossed, but if something happens, pretend this comment was just an April Fool's joke. :(</p>
 <p>tl;dr... Ya'll can complain about whatever you want, but take it easy on the conspiracy theories.</p>
