 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He possessed the Heretic God’s power and the Sky Poison Pearl, both were singularly unique items in this universe. Even though possessing these things allowed him to live a completely different life, they had also come with an equivalent amount of risk and danger. The moment they were exposed, it would definitely draw an extremely large amount of covetous eyes towards him, so it was inevitable that he had to be careful and vigilant at all times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At present, his greatest secret had already been exposed to Qianye Ying’er’s side. Even if she did not tell anybody else, it still meant that he could forget about ever living a peaceful and carefree life… Unless he could rise above Qianye Ying’er, and rise above everyone else in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, Shen Xi’s words were not wrong to Yun Che’s understanding… Even if the points they were referring to may have been different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of the things you said are things that I already understand,” Yun Che said. “Fine, I won’t try to force you to tell me the things you don’t want to talk about again. Right now, I only want to think of the quickest way to get rid of this Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark… I’ll think about the rest of it after this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Shen Xi, tell me this one thing first. Is there a way for me to get rid of the Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark quicker, and if there is, what is it?” Yun Che asked. With the Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark still in his body, what Qianye or Dragon Monarch… he basically did not have any spare effort to waste thinking about them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Xi replied in a cool voice, “Dual cultivate with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che was immediately struck dumb, “Eh…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, since you are able to create and manipulate light profound energy, that will also greatly shorten the amount of time it will take.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Xi turned around and walked towards the bamboo house that only one outsider, Yun Che, had ever stepped inside before. After that, she said, “Follow me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che paused for a moment before he followed behind Shen Xi and left He Ling quietly standing in her original spot as she remained completely dumbfounded for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bamboo door closed behind them and the world became incomparably quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just at the moment when Yun Che wanted to ask a question that Shen Xi extended a jade arm as she lightly traced something in the air, her white sleeve flapping in the wind. Immediately, a white light shone from an unknown location, illuminating the entire bamboo hut in a sea of lustrous white light. After that, one could no longer see a trace of emerald-green, it was as if the entire space had been transformed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the white light was dense, it was not glaring. Within this world that had turned pure white, characters started appearing in the air. These characters were also white, yet they were, strangely enough, exceptionally clear and easy to make out in this dense white light. These characters started to slowly dance in the air, eventually converging to form a gigantic profound art. As the white light curled up around these characters, they released an incomparably profound and holy aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che raised his head to stare at this strange profound art that was being bathed in light, “This is…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the light divine art that I am about to teach you,” Shen Xi said in a gentle voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Light… divine art?” Yun Che muttered in a soft voice, his eyes rigidly fixed on those characters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Light profound energy is different from all the other profound energies you are familiar with, its true essence absolutely does not lie in force or destruction. Rather, the true essence of light profound energy is cleansing and salvation. Your body is weighed down by a very heavy aura of malice and blood, so this is definitely not a power suited for you to wield, and perhaps you are also not too interested in this sort of power which provides nearly no combat ability. However, if you want to quickly get rid of your Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark, then this light divine art is the best choice you have at present.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Shen Xi said these things, Yun Che had been silently staring at the light divine art that was floating in the air. He was very convinced that this was the first time he had ever come in contact with this profound art, yet he suddenly had this notion that he might have seen this somewhere before. This was an extremely strange and indescribable feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Shen Xi, are you letting me cultivate this light divine art so that I can purge myself of the Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Xi gave a light nod of her head, “The reason why I was able to purge your Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark in the first place was by the power of this light divine art. So even though your strength is extremely far from mine, the power of other people and the power that originates from your own body can’t be put in the same sentence at the end of the day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can handle light profound energy so you just barely have the qualifications to cultivate this light divine art. If you are able to master the contents of this divine art, you will not only be able to cleanse yourself of the Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark, your lifespan will also far exceed that of the human race.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Other than that, this divine art isn’t just a simple light profound art, it also contains unique laws of ‘Creation’ and an extremely high level medical knowledge. If you can comprehend everything within it, you can not only save yourself, but others as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All those years ago, she had used light divine power to save the Dragon Monarch who was on the brink of death… Not only had she completely restored his profound veins and meridians, she had even been able to completely restore his eyes and tongue which had been destroyed. In the God Realm, it was said that this power that transcended all normal understanding was something that only Shen Xi possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also why Xia Qingyue, in her despair, had not hesitated to bring Yun Che to the distant Dragon God Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che finally managed to move his gaze away from the floating characters before he asked, “If I am able to cultivate it, how long will it take me to get rid of the Brahma Soul Death-Wishing Mark?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Within ten years,” The number Shen Xi had just uttered was five times less than what it initially had been.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s expression changed slightly… Even though it was still far too long, compared to being trapped in this place for fifty years, it was a far better option.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But you shouldn’t become happy too soon. The level of this light divine art is extremely high and if you desire to comprehend its contents, being able to control light profound energy is only one of the most basic conditions. You also need an extremely high comprehension ability and the right opportunities. Besides that…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Xi’s words came to a small stop before a look of regret and pity appeared on her celestial mien, “This is only half of the divine art.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Half?” Yun Che was mildly stunned by those words, “Then where is the other half?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Xi shook her head, “This light divine art came from an incomparably distant era in the past, and it should also be the only remaining copy of the light divine art in the current universe. To be able to obtain even half of it is already being blessed by the heavens and the other half will probably never ever be found.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is… a divine art from the Primordial Era of Gods?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che, “...!!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Yun Che’s Heretic God powers, yet another Creation God’s powers had appeared in this world… No! It had appeared at a far earlier time than Yun Che’s own Heretic God powers. It was just that the entire God Realm knew the “Dragon Queen Shen Xi” was the most unique existence under heaven, an existence that could turn death to life, could turn a rotten piece of wood into a forest. Yet they had not known that this unique power, a power that only she possessed in this universe, was actually the power of a Creation God.</span></p>

Shen Xi had originally thought that he had been astounded by the name “Creation God Art”. Yet at this moment, Yun Che said something that actually stunned her instead, “This light divine art, is it’s name… the 【Divine Miracle of Life】?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Shen Xi’s crescent brows twitched slightly as her beautiful eyes swivelled towards him, “You actually know of this name?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she looked at Yun Che’s clearly strange behaviour and appearance, Shen Xi began to feel a faint suspicion, “Why do you know of this?”</span></p>

After that it formed a profound shadow and following a wave of his hand, it slowly spread open in front of him.</span></p>

It was actually the Creation God Art of the Creation Goddess of Life Li Suo, the 【Divine Miracle of Life】.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As it involved a Creation God Art on the same level as the Heretic God’s powers, this was a conversation that Yun Che definitely was not able to forget. He had previously tried to comprehend it before, but he had met with no success. Even though, he had carved the entire “Heavenly Medicine Manual” into his heart, his understanding of it had basically all come from Yun Gu.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the slightly wondrous feeling of compatibility that came from the same divine art!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following this, an incomparably strange and fantastic scene unfurled before their eyes. The two parts of the divine art that had come from Shen Xi and Yun Che respectively had actually started to dance together. After that, they drew near to each other at a very swift speed… until they perfectly merged together. Following that, the light and aura radiating from these characters flowed and blended together before spreading out to reveal a complete light divine art, and at the same time, it also opened up a whole new world.</span></p>

Bright ripples spread within her beautiful eyes and they did not fade away for a very long time.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She closed her eyes for a long time before slowly opening them again. After that, she turned towards Yun Che and said, “This latter half of the Divine Miracle of Life, where did you obtain it from?”</span></p>

This half of a divine art was something he unwittingly found. Master was convinced that this was a very special medical manual that stored an extremely deep and high level of medical knowledge. So he called it the ‘Heavenly Medicine Manual’ as a way of saying that this was a medical manual that the heavens themselves had bestowed on him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shen Xi, “...”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No,” Yun Che shook his head before answering in a frustrated voice, “Master is someone who has a pure and sacred heart. He has only sought to help people and increase his medical prowess his entire life, and he is even somewhat repulsed by the profound way. From the beginning to the end, he had thought this was a medical manual and he was completely unable to comprehend ninety-nine percent of the knowledge contained within it. The remaining tiny one percent was medical knowledge he comprehended through sheer devotion to his craft and his own intuition as a physician.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Divine Miracle of Life does indeed contain medical knowledge, but the level of those medical principles are extremely high. For your master in medicine to be able to comprehend just the slightest bit of it with his mortal heart and perception, is already enough to call him a person of extraordinary talent.”</span></p>

But after Yun Gu had passed away, he began to gradually realize that Yun Gu was a genuine saint by any and all measures. A person like that was someone he might not find again in his life and even in the entire mortal world.</span></p>
