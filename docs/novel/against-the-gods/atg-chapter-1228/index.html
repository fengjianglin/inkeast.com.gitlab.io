He was bleeding all over his body, his chest was badly mutilated, and his handsome face had swollen to twice its normal size. Blood and rotten flesh looked like they were mashed together to form a paste, and the only part left that made Luo Changsheng recognizable was his dark and hateful eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Had Luo Changsheng been anyone else, they would’ve died three times over after being slashed by the Heaven Smiting Sword more than ten times while their profound energy was falling apart. Right now Luo Changsheng looked worse than a man who was tortured until he died, but he still managed to stand up in the end. Although his aura was chaotic and had become half as strong as before, it still created great pressure on Yun Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che’s heart tightened. For the first time in this battle, he was stunned by Luo Changsheng’s tenacity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I slashed him fifteen times with the all the phoenix power I possess. Every hit was brutal and accompanied by the sound of shattering bones… so why is he able to stand up after that? And his profound energy is still so strong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know that Luo Shangchen and Luo Guxie, two experts who were regarded as superiors throughout the star realms of the Eastern Divine Region, were at least ten times more shocked than he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dragon soul… How did Yun Che come by a dragon soul? Where did he get it?” Luo Shangchen muttered to himself in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dragon was a creature of the highest level in the Primal Chaos, and the same went for its soul. A dragon’s soul could be destroyed or sealed away by force, but never seized!</span></p>

Moreover, it also couldn’t be passed on to the next generation like a bloodline, much less transferred or forcefully seized by another party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why many people possessed the bloodline of dragons in the Eastern Divine Region—Lu Lengchuan was one such example—but very few actually possessed a dragon soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Shangchen was a powerful expert. He easily noticed that Yun Che’s dragon soul was no ordinary dragon soul either. But… why would a dragon with a such a powerful soul grant its very source to a human junior?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Changsheng’s soul is stronger than even a Divine King’s soul after it was tempered by the Divine Water of Absolute Beginning. There’s no way his soul should’ve lost this easily!” Luo Guxie’s voice was obviously shaking due to Luo Changsheng’s current appearance, “Not even if it was a dragon’s soul!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s definitely no ordinary True Dragon soul.” Luo Shangchen frowned before a possibility entered his mind, “Yun Che’s claim that he hails from a lower realm… may very well be false! Such a powerful dragon soul can only come from a Divine Master dragon at minimum! In fact, Yun Che himself may actually hail from the Western Divine Region, and he’s somehow related to the Dragon God Race, or he wouldn’t have had such a powerful body and soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Luo Guxie’s chest heaved rapidly as her aura occasionally turned cold or chaotic, “How dare he hurt my Changsheng… that little brute!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps no one, not even those who had been “Fairy Guxie’s” acquaintance for over ten thousand years, had seen her this out of sorts before today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Shangchen shot a glance at her and looked like he wanted to say something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This dragon soul is quite powerful. It may be the gift of a master dragon.” the Eternal Heaven God Emperor turned to look at Dragon Monarch, “Do you recognize who the soul belongs to, Dragon Monarch?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon Monarch didn’t nod or shake his head. He answered indifferently, “Yun Che is just a human, but his talent is rare to say the least. It is not surprising that a master dragon of our realm may have decided to break the norm and grant him their soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mn.” the Eternal Heaven God Emperor nodded slightly. Dragon Monarch obviously wanted to sidestep this question, so he wasn’t going to prod him further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Monarch didn’t look away from Yun Che even once throughout this series of events. Although the emotions in his eyes had become calm once more, in reality they were still seething deep within his pupils, heart, and soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since a long time ago, he had already noticed that Yun Che possessed both a dragon’s bloodline and soul. He was the Dragon Monarch, the king of all creations and the lord of all dragons after all. He had even arrived at the conclusion that the bloodline and soul Yun Che possessed were of incredibly high level. Although he had never said a word about it, he paid close attention to Yun Che long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because he could easily deduce the type and level of Yun Che’s dragon soul the moment he used it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when Yun Che finally unleashed his Dragon Soul Domain in battle, he, the realm king of Dragon God Realm, the indisputable champion who was feared and respected throughout the entire Primal Chaos actually felt fear, shock and even... humility, in that one instant. It was an emotion he had never felt for the past three hundred and fifty thousand years of his existence until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even now, the azure eyes that had opened above Yun Che’s head had left a clear, lingering imprint inside his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was looking at Yun Che in an entirely new light… he was no longer looking at Yun Che like he was just another human junior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yun… Che!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng’s voice had become completely distorted. At this point, he was so filled with anger, hatred, and mania that he couldn’t even retain full sanity—or at least, he no longer cared for the handsome image he had cultivated for himself one bit—his glowing, purple eyes said that he wanted nothing more than to cut Yun Che into mince meat, grind his bone to dust, and scatter it to the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took a step forward, blood spraying freely out of his wounds. With both hands, he slowly raised the blood drenched Dragon Compassion Blade and enveloped Yun Che inside a pressure that was unstable, yet still powerful enough to be fatal to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che had to use nearly all of his strength just to raise the Heaven Smiting Sword in front of him. His arms were shaking uncontrollably against his will in the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng might’ve underestimated Yun Che, but Yun Che had underestimated Luo Changsheng as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t Luo Changsheng’s strength that he had underestimated. It was his unnaturally powerful body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had struck Luo Changsheng tens of times until his body was tattered, and his bones were shattered in more than a dozen of places. And yet, Luo Changsheng was still able to summon such tremendous power… His body was practically as tough as his own!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only reason his body was this tough was because he had the Dragon God’s bloodline, marrow, and he cultivated Great Way of the Buddha… just how on earth did Luo Changsheng cultivate his body!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng was a true profound practitioner at the tenth level of the Divine Spirit Realm, so his well of profound energy was countless times greater than Yun Che’s. Because Yun Che failed to incapitate Luo Changsheng completely, this gigantic disadvantage of his was starting to rear its ugly head. Although Yun Che’s wounds were much lighter than Luo Changsheng’s, his profound energy was nothing compared to the latter’s right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“... Die!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng let out a hoarse, strange-sounding cry as a gigantic tornado circled around the Dragon Compassion Blade, looking like he would crush Yun Che into mince meat right now.</span></p>

He was thrown far, far away as tens of wounds burst open across his chest. His internal organs especially were rolling around and falling apart en masse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luckily for him, Luo Changsheng’s wounds were too severe. The attack caused Luo Changsheng’s own injuries inside and outside to worsen at once as five to six mouthfuls of blood forced their way out of his throat. His body wobbled, and he nearly fell to the ground. It was at this moment Yun Che jumped into the air and attacked Luo Changsheng again. Glaring golden light suddenly burst out of his body, and he burned like a sun that would turn everything into nothingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s… the Golden Crow blood!” Huo Rulie exclaimed involuntarily.</span></p>

At this point Luo Changsheng couldn’t move his body as he wished and couldn’t dodge out of the way, so instead he roared and summoned yet another storm powerful enough to distort even space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!!</span></p>

Beneath the fire, the Dragon Compassion Blade and the Heaven Smiting Sword pushed against one another as two equally dark eyes also stared fiercely at each other through the gap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Booom...</span></p>

Shuddering, Luo Changsheng’s right knee slammed fiercely against the floor and shattered upon impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Changsheng’s eyes looked so dark and fierce that it was scary. His arms were shaking violently under pressure, his broken muscles were bulging to their limits, and his joints were creaking non-stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aaaaaah… AAAHHH!!!”</span></p>

Luo Changsheng stumbled after he got back on his feet, but rather than steadying himself, he chose to pounce at Yun Che like a crazed animal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just the same, with total disregard to his own injuries Yun Che flipped around in midair and charged straight toward Luo Changsheng. The Heaven Smiting Sword burning with golden flames and pale white blade covered by a storm clashed again so deafeningly that the blue sky itself threatened to split in half.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if a profound thunder storm had suddenly visited the Conferred God Stage.</span></p>

Fire burned away the wind, the wind tore away the fire; the sword shattered the blade, the blade devoured the sword. The two blood drenched combatants attacked one another in the sky of the Conferred God Stage madly while roaring at each other like wild animals.</span></p>

Luo Changsheng’s body was horrifically mutiliated, and Yun Che’s was burning his divine blood just to keep fighting… they all believed that this fight would be entertaining beyond compare, but none of them had predicted the depths of desperation it had descended to.</span></p>

Even if Yun Che lost this battle, his name would still spread throughout the entire Eastern Divine Region. But at this point, who could fail to notice Yun Che’s indescribable thirst for victory?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why they threw the words “glorious defeat” to the back of their mind. Instead, they shouted with all their mind hoping that Yun Che would win.</span></p>

He knew very well that the only reason Yun Che was still in the fight was because he had burned all of the Golden Crow divine blood. The second the burst of divine power ran out, defeat was all but certain.</span></p>

Hidden inside a puff of distant cloud, a pair of scarlet eyes stared quietly at the bloody battle happening on the Conferred God Stage.
