 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Caizhi left the Heavenly Wolf God Palace and bitterly held back her tears until she finally landed. She was filled with a sense of injustice over what had happened to her, but compared to her feeling of being wronged, she was even more unwilling to argue it out and cause Jasmine to become even more angry at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She extended a hand to wipe away the tears that blurred her eyes, leaving two long wet trails of tears stained across her snow white face. After that, she saw Heavenly Poison Star God Moonflower and Heavenly Demon Star God Rose descend from the skies above... It was clear that they had just returned from the Eternal Heaven Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” The eyesight of a Star God was so powerful that even though the distance was extremely far, both people could clearly tell that Caizhi wore an aggrieved expression and that tears stained her face. Moonflower’s eyes turned and she smiled cheerily as she said, “Oh my!? What has happened to our little princess? Who has such gall to actually cause our little princess to cry. This servant’s heart hurts just looking at you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The face of the Heavenly Demon Star God, Rose, did not even have a hint of inquisitiveness... Given Caizhi’s temperament, if she did not go and bully others, that would already be quite an excellent thing. So the only person that could make her feel aggrieved was Heavenly Slaughter Star God Jasmine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Caizhi tried to wipe away the tear stains from her face in a fluster. Her gaze swept away from Rose’s figure to stare straight at Moonflower. She pointed a finger at her and said in a huffy voice, “Moonflower! Go to Stardust Palace with this princess and have a duel with me! Right now!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aah?” Moonflower’s eyes narrowed, “Little princess, you mustn't take out your anger on this servant just because you got bullied. If this servant makes a careless mistake and hurts our little princess, that would be a great crime indeed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! This is this princess’ order, do you dare to disobey it!?” Caizhi’s eyebrows slanted as her aura rose greatly. It seemed as if she would immediately begin the fight if her request was not complied with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moonflower’s neck contracted slightly, an expression of fear on her face as she cast a pitiful glance towards the Heavenly Demon Star God, “Rose, how about you play with the little princess? This servant simply doesn’t dare to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Demon Star God coldly turned around before saying, “It’s rare for Her Highness Caizhi to be in such high spirits, so you should just follow your orders and do as you’re told.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished saying that, the Heavenly Star Demon God flew off into the distance and vanished from sight in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, men are such fickle creatures after all,” Moonflower muttered in a gloomy and resentful voice. “Fine, fine. This servant naturally does not dare to disobey the orders of our little princess. So I’ll play with our little princess for a little bit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moonflower’s fingers bent gracefully as a faint jade green light danced across the tip of her finger, “Now that I think about it, this servant is also very curious to know just how much our little princess has grown... This is something that the entire king realm is exceedingly concerned about, you know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------------------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Yun Che waited for the better part of an hour, he was guided by Xing Ling to where the Star God Emperor and the Star Gods who accompanied him were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this Profound God Convention, the Star God Emperor had brought along four Star Gods. The Heavenly Poison and Heavenly Demon Star Gods had returned to the Star God Realm first, and the other two Star Gods...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To his left was a short man who looked really skinny yet he was the Star God who possessed the greatest physical strength amongst the Twelve Star Gods, <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Strength</span> Star God Shenhu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To his right was an old man with gentle features—Heavenly Origin Star God Tumi. It was said that his lifespan had already exceeded forty thousand years, that he was the sage of the Star God Realm, as well as the emperor’s teacher. He was the person that was most respected and esteemed by the Star God Emperor. The reason why Heavenly Chief Star God Xing Juekong could become the Star God Emperor had a lot to do with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this Profound God Convention, everyone could see that the Heavenly Origin Star God had actually been seated on equal footing with the Star God Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Snow Song Realm’s Junior Yun Che greets the Star God Emperor, Senior Heavenly Origin, and Senior <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Strength</span>.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che made his greetings, his attitude respectful and reverential. But it was not because they were the Star God Emperor and his Star Gods, it was because… one of them was Jasmine’s very own father and the other was Jasmine’s master before she became a Star God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gazes of the Star Gods and their accompanying Star Guards lingered on Yun Che’s body for a long period of time, and even though Yun Che was a junior who came from low and petty origins, their eyes did not contain the slightest bit of arrogance or contempt for an inferior being... This was because Yun Che was the person who had truly shaken the world during the Profound God Convention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fact that he had chosen the Star God Realm already could be construed as him bestowing a great honor upon their Star God Realm... After all, even the Eternal Heaven God Emperor, the Brahma Heaven God Emperor, and the Dragon Monarch had all found themselves locked out of the gates when they tried to invite him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh heh, there’s no need to stand on ceremony,” the Star God Emperor said with a chuckle as he raised his hand. “Yun Che, I, the Star God Emperor, very rarely invite outsiders into my own realm. As someone who comes from the middle star realms, you are the first person to be invited in nearly a thousand years. However, it could also be said that you are the most important and honored guest to come in said thousand years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Che hurriedly said, “This junior is stricken with fear, I do not deserve such praise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was at this moment that he was close enough to take a good look at the Star God Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As one of the four god emperors of the Eastern Divine Region, the Star God Emperor had a countenance that radiated might even though he was not angry. Yet at the same time, he did not emit an aura which was overly oppressive. This was especially true regarding his eyes since although they were as like radiant pools of still water, they contained a sharpness that could pierce a person’s heart and soul with a glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His hair was a most common pitch black color, while Jasmine’s was scarlet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He is my birth father and also the person I hate the most in this world. One of the reasons why I don’t wish to go back is because I’m unwilling to see that face of his which only provokes feelings of hatred and loathing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” The words Jasmine had said all those years ago reverberated in Yun Che’s head, causing his feelings immediately become more complicated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The word “father” was something that he regarded as the most sacred thing in his world. No matter whether it was his real father Yun Qinghong, or his foster father Xiao Ying, both of them were men he felt extreme gratitude and reverence towards. But in Jasmine’s world, the word “father” was like a nightmare that twined around her, a nightmare that she could not be rid of. She very rarely mentioned him and every time she did mention him, feelings of resentment and hatred would rise up as well… and it was a profoundly deep resentment and hatred.</span></p>

A powerful current of majestic force flowed down like a galaxy of stars and in the blink of an eye, an area of hundreds of kilometers was completely turned into a world of destruction.

Even as the power of the Heavenly Wolf rent the heavens and tore at the earth, it was still unable to destroy this small world. Furthermore, it was at this moment that tens of profound light beams suddenly shot out from this jade-green small world. These light beams morphed into strange tendrils as they pierced through layer after layer of the Heavenly Wolf’s power.</span></p>

This caused Caizhi’s body to shake violently as she just barely avoided any damage, but the Heavenly Wolf Sacred Sword flew out of her hand.

He achieved such splendid and awe-inspiring achievements in battle.”</span></p>

Furthermore, when His Highness Xisu faced down those two Moon Gods, he was only slightly stronger than them.

As a result of this, the heavier one’s resentment and hatred is, the greater the divine power of the Heavenly Wolf will become.”</span></p>

So what would you know of hatred and resentment? Aiyah...” Moonflower’s fingers danced as jade-green light coiled around them, “Ah, it truly is just a slight pity.”</span></p>

If it was not for the protection of my aunt, big brother, and big sister, all of whom regarded me as their family, I, the so-called little princess of the Star God Realm, would perhaps have been tossed aside into some corner which no one knew of.
