 <p>The Barbaric Bull King’s fur was vertical and stiff, glowing a blood-red color. The bull’s eyes were overcome with fury, and had turned completely red.</p> 
 <p>The Barbaric Bull King glared at Blue Maple, like it couldn’t wait to knock this human into the sky and trample him under its hooves!</p> 
 <p>However, the Barbaric Bull King hadn’t touched Blue Maple from the beginning to the end. It didn’t even graze him. From the bull’s perspective, Blue Maple was like a feline who could predict its every move, or he couldn’t possibly be human!</p> 
 <p>The Barbaric Bull King was infuriated, with whatever consciousness it had been given, and it needed more strength to kill this enemy which had angered it.</p> 
 <p><strong><em>[Enraged Barbaric Bull King] (Rank 22 Elite Boss)</em></strong></p> 
 <p><em>Attack: 162-183</em></p> 
 <p><em>Defense: 57-68</em></p> 
 <p><em>Magic Defense: 24-35</em></p> 
 <p><em>HP: 2,378</em></p> 
 <p><em>Skills: Wild Charge</em></p> 
 <p><em><strong>Introduction:</strong> One of the leaders of wild animals living in the Foggy Grasslands. It is very aggressive, and its skill is stronger than usual. The Barbaric Bull King has mutated, you are advised to leave! Or, you can find teammates to kill it!</em></p> 
 <p>“Little rascal, you can’t see monsters’ attributes that are more than ten ranks above you. I’m showing you mercy by showing you the bull’s attributes. Ugh, I didn’t project my voice into his ears. Fuck, what a waste of words. Forget it, I don’t think it would matter to the little rascal whether or not he can see the bull’s attributes,” the old man muttered to himself in the shadows.</p> 
 <p><em>Ding! <strong>Game Announcement:</strong> The Barbaric Bull King is enraged, and has mutated into the Enraged Barbaric Bull King. All negative effects are dispelled, and its attack has increased by 50%, while its Defense has gone down by 30%.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Eh? This mutation is a little different. That’s probably how it should be, anyway. The same mutations every time is rather boring. </em>Blue Maple was momentarily confused before he reconciled with the facts.</p> 
 <p>The Barbaric Bull King should have lower health, but Blue Maple wasn’t fighting monsters in Novice Village anymore. These monsters could regenerate, and they regenerated about one hit point per second.</p> 
 <p>The Barbaric Bull King had recovered from its injuries, so attacking its leg again was meaningless. Blue Maple had to use all his strength to attack the bull’s body, and he had to go for vital points as much as possible. His condition wasn’t becoming better, so he couldn’t delay any longer.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple’s attributes had declined by 12% because of his fatigue. This meant that his movement speed, attack, defense, and whatnot had declined by 12%!</p> 
 <p>The Barbaric Bull King’s rank increased a little while its Defense was a little lower. Blue Maple’s attack value had also fallen a little, so his overall damage should increase a little.</p> 
 <p>The bull had recovered its speed, while Blue Maple’s speed was reduced. He had to be even more focused!</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple calculated his situation and the bull’s. The game only limited his body, it didn’t limit his brain or his rationality. His mind was just getting warmed up, and his mentality was still clear even after fighting for several hours. This was just the beginning!</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple would have died a long time ago if he couldn’t keep his mind in peak condition in the Chaotic Region back on Earth.</p> 
 <p>Heightened focus!</p> 
 <p>“Moo!” the Enraged Barbaric Bull King bellowed as it charged towards Blue Maple. Wild Charge!</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple found skills that moved in a single direction the easiest to dodge. He sidestepped the bull and slashed furiously at the bull’s torso.</p> 
 <p><em>Swoosh!</em> The blade dragged open a long and bloody gash across the Enraged Barbaric Bull King’s body. The bull’s powerful momentum and pushing force almost took Blue Maple’s sword out of his hands, but he clutched onto his sword tightly as he followed up with another attack: Cold Light Slash!</p> 
 <p><em>-23, -3, -3, -2, -25! </em>The damage points were displayed one after another.</p> 
 <p><em>Eh? Where did those damage points come from? </em>Blue Maple glanced at the small damage values that appeared after the first one in confusion.</p> 
 <p><em>Ding! <strong>Announcement</strong>: Your attack has caused relatively severe injuries to the Enraged Barbaric Bull King, and you have made it bleed. It will bleed for one hit point per second, and this effect will last for five seconds.</em></p> 
 <p><em>That can happen? Heh. I can use Wild Charge’s momentum to inflict damage! Even though the first tick of damage didn’t increase much, the long gash caused continuous bleeding damage. This game that’s half-based in real life… is becoming more interesting! Hehe!… </em>Blue Maple’s thoughts flashed.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple’s eyes had something else in them when he stared at the enormous bull. This extra ‘something’ only existed when Blue Maple was interested in something, which meant that Blue Maple was starting to get serious.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple’s attitude wasn’t as simple as before, when he focused on killing this gigantic bull. Blue Maple would become even more terrifying when he wanted to know more about something that fascinated him, or when he wanted to experience novel things.</p> 
 <p><em>I can’t increase my body’s speed, but I can add some techniques. So, let’s begin!, </em>Blue Maple thought to himself as his mouth curved into a smile.</p> 
 <p>The impression that Blue Maple gave off was like a lonely kid who had obtained a new toy…</p> 
 <p>The Barbaric Bull King paused for a moment after completing its charge, then turned around and charged at Blue Maple again. Blue Maple didn’t try to dodge the bull’s attack, and he remained still, like he had given up on attacking.</p> 
 <p>The Enraged Barbaric Bull King was almost about to touch Blue Maple when he suddenly moved. He turned his body at an angle so that he was facing the bull’s flank, and the bull was parallel to his body as it zipped past him. Blue Maple turned his feet slightly before he shifted backward and planted his foot firmly on the ground, then he leaned back as he swung his sword into the air and pointed it at the bull’s flank.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple evaded the bull’s attack with this tiny movement, and he dealt damage to the Barbaric Bull King by opening another gash on its body. This gash wasn’t as deep as before, but…</p> 
 <p><em>-21, -2, -1, -1!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Ding!<strong> Announcement: </strong>Your attack has caused relatively severe injuries to the Enraged Barbaric Bull King, and you have made it bleed. It will bleed for one hit point per second, and this effect will last for three seconds.</em></p> 
 <p><em>That did happen. How interesting, hehe!… </em>Not even three seconds had passed from the start of the bull’s attack until this moment!</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple seemed like he was dancing around the Barbaric Bull King’s body, but his sluggish body was still like an agile and nimble feline.</p> 
 <p>------</p> 
 <p>The old man’s mouth hung open in the shadows. His eyes were full of surprise, and that expression continued for several seconds. The old man watched Blue Maple humiliate the Barbaric Bull King several times before he closed his mouth and uttered one word.</p> 
 <p>“Fuck!”</p> 
 <p>“Fuck. This guy is definitely not human to be able to play like that. What does he do in the real world? He doesn’t have a murderous aura at all, so he’s not from an organization of assassins. However, he’s not just a normal hitman. Fuck… forget it. I need to be cultured because I’m a respected man...”</p> 
 <p>------</p> 
 <p><em>What happens if I cut across again with my sword? </em>Blue Maple was playing so much that he was getting excited, and he started thinking about other things.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple used his nimble fighting technique to dodge the Barbaric Bull King’s attack as he hacked furiously at the bull’s torso once more, and forcibly dragged his sword in the other direction.</p> 
 <p><em>-21, -3, -3, -2!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Ding! <strong>Game Announcement: </strong>Your attack has caused relatively severe injuries to the Enraged Barbaric Bull King, and you have made it bleed. It will bleed for one hit point per second, and this effect will last for three seconds.</em></p> 
 <p><em>I managed to achieve the same outcome as I did when he was charging. If I do that when he’s charging… will that be even more fun?, </em>Blue Maple continued thinking to himself.</p> 
 <p>The Enraged Barbaric Bull King’s Wild Charge was about to cool off; Blue Maple just had to wait for a few moments. Bleeding damage continued stacking on the bull’s body as ‘-1’ damage points appeared one after another. An extremely long gash appeared along the bull’s body, and Blue Maple started becoming even more interested.</p> 
 <p>A few more waves of attacks passed before the bull paused momentarily, signaling that it was about to use Wild Charge.</p> 
 <p>Wild Charge!</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple deftly evaded the bull once more, except he had to start moving earlier as Wild Charge was too quick, and he could only dodge it if he moved earlier. Speed could render all reactions futile, no matter how quick a person’s reflexes were, and speed could even negate all technical prowess. Blue Maple possessed incredibly fast reflex time and great technical ability, but even then, he wasn’t invincible when his opponent completely suppressed him.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple clutched his sword tightly, as he almost lost his grip before this. He had to use all his strength to cut another gash open, as his sword was going to fly into the air if he didn’t clutch it tightly.</p> 
 <p><em>Swish! </em>A terrifying gash appeared on the bull’s flank, in addition to the lines of gashes already on its body, which gave it a mortifying look. However, Blue Maple had seen people who looked like that, let alone bulls.</p> 
 <p><em>-23, -4, -4, -3, -25!</em></p> 
 <p>Blue Maple realized that Cold Light Slash and the Enraged Barbaric Bull King’s Wild Charge shared the same cooldown, so he followed up with Cold Light Slash.</p> 
 <p><em>Ding!<strong> Announcement:</strong> Your attack has caused relatively severe injuries to the Enraged Barbaric Bull King, and you have made it bleed. It will bleed for three hit points every two seconds, and this effect will last for six seconds.</em></p> 
 <p><em>That does happen!</em></p> 
 <p>Blue Maple made a fool of the Enraged Barbaric Bull King for four more minutes. The bull’s hit points were almost depleted, and Blue Maple could finish it off with a few more hits when he suddenly frowned.</p> 
 <p>The old man scoffed to himself happily when he saw that, thinking to himself, <em>You’re not that powerful, are you, little rascal? Let’s see what you’re going to do this time. The Barbaric Bull King is going to demonize, and I want to see you try to dodge the bull when it has that speed. You’re even stronger than I was back then… Psh, I was stronger than he is. My memory must have failed me. Yes, that must be it.</em></p> 
 <p>Yes, the Enraged Barbaric Bull King was likely to mutate for a second time, just like the Slime King did. This situation was similar to the Slime King situation back then, and the bull’s speed would increase once more. Blue Maple wouldn’t have much chance to dodge when that happened. He wouldn’t just be hurt if the bull managed to hit him, because the bull had a higher attack value, so he would be immediately killed by the immense level disadvantage!</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple wouldn’t be able to complete his quest, and his level would also drop. The old man was undoubtedly going to mock him!</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple couldn’t toss his sword like he did with the Slime King anymore. The Enraged Barbaric Bull King’s charge momentum was too great, and its body wouldn’t stop moving even if the bull died midway. This game was half-based in real life, and the bull’s corpse would probably still hurt Blue Maple if it crashed into him. Even though Blue Maple probably wouldn’t die, he wouldn’t complete this quest without taking a single point of damage.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple was paying attention to this, but how was he going to deal with it?</p> 
 <p><em>The Enraged Barbaric Bull King should behave like it did. It should start mutating after Wild Charge has cooled down. Wild Charge is going to cool down before I can kill it. According to my current damage points, it will take me two more hits two more hits to kill the bull, even if its Defense is lowered… I think I can only try... </em>Blue Maple calculated rapidly.</p> 
 <p>A formidable aura radiated from the Barbaric Bull King’s body after a few more attacks, just like Blue Maple expected.</p> 
 <p><em>Weng! </em>The second mutation was coming!</p> 
 <p>“Moo!”</p> 
 <p><strong><em>[Enraged Barbaric Bull King – Savage] (Rank 24 Demonized Boss)</em></strong></p> 
 <p><em>Attack: 235-257</em></p> 
 <p><em>Defense: 16-19</em></p> 
 <p><em>Magic Defense: 5-7</em></p> 
 <p><em>HP: 58</em></p> 
 <p><em><strong>Introduction:</strong> One of the leaders of wild animals living in the Foggy Grasslands. It is very aggressive, and its skill is stronger than usual. The Barbaric Bull King has completed its Savage mutation. Contact is ill-advised.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Ding! <strong>Game Announcement:</strong> The Enraged Barbaric Bull King has become completely savage, and its attack is now increased by 50%, and its movement speed has increased by 30%. Its defense has decreased by 20%. You are in much danger, please take care!</em></p> 
 <p>The system was very sympathetic. However, Blue Maple didn’t have time to think about all that. He relied on the powerful air flow and started running away from the Bull King, hurling his sword in the bull’s direction the moment that the air flows disappeared.</p> 
 <p><em>-39!</em></p> 
 <p>“This fellow knows how to throw his sword. Good!” The old man was full of praise.</p> 
 <p>“But what are you going to do next, you little rascal? You don’t have a sword anymore.” The old man continued watching Blue Maple, his eyes sharp.</p> 
 <p>The Enraged Barbaric Bull King immediately used Wild Charge when he was struck. It almost didn’t stop this time, but Blue Maple had already distanced himself through the powerful wind when he suddenly uttered a word.</p> 
 <p>“Equip!”</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple’s Novice Sword appeared in his hands, and he tossed it again with Cold Light Slash, along with his basic attack!</p>
