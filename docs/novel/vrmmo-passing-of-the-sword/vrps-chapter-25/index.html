 <p>When Blue Maple walked into the hotel, he immediately saw a ravishing NPC smiling and asking him, “Sir, are you here to find lodging?”</p> 
 <p>“Yes,” Blue Maple immediately replied. At the same time, Blue Maple was skeptical as he thought to himself. <em>Don’t tell me that these counter NPCs are all beautiful ladies?</em></p> 
 <p>In fact, it was not what he thought. It was just that he was a little fortunate. For example…</p> 
 <p>------</p> 
 <p>“Sir, what are you here for? Are you here to stay? I’ll provide the best quality service.” A bearded man was rubbing his hands as he spoke cheerfully to Subtle Nobleman.</p> 
 <p>Subtle Nobleman was tempted after he heard his words, but he forced a straight face as he replied, “No, I came to the wrong place. I hope we never meet again!” After that, he turned around and left. The speed at which he left made it feel as if he had broken the barrier to Level 10.</p> 
 <p><em>What kind of hotel is in this game? Fuck, how is it possible that such a hotel hasn’t collapsed. Fortunately, I snuck away quickly. Otherwise, I would have lost my virginity. I’m a pure, handsome guy okay?,</em> Subtle Nobleman thought to himself as he walked away…</p> 
 <p>------</p> 
 <p>As Subtle Nobleman was escaping from that hotel...</p> 
 <p>“We have four different types of rooms: ordinary, medium, deluxe and presidential. Their respective prices are fifty bronze coins, one silver coin, three silver coins, and one gold coin. The services in the presidential suite are all-encompassing.”</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple seemed not to have heard the NPC’s last sentence as he replied, “I’ll just get the medium room.”</p> 
 <p>“Alright, give me a moment.” The NPC then turned around and shouted into the hotel, “Chris, bring this customer to Room 207!” After she finished shouting, it seemed she recorded something before she retrieved the room key.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I’m coming!” a male voice responded.</p> 
 <p>“Can you give me a room at the highest level?” Blue Maple suddenly asked.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, alright. Please wait a minute then.” The lady was startled for a moment before placing the key back to its original spot. She took another key and re-recorded her entry. Chris also rushed over at this moment. He was a young man dressed as a waiter.</p> 
 <p>“Chris, bring this customer to Room 507 instead of Room 207,” the lady instructed him. At the same time, she passed the key to Blue Maple. “Sir, this is your key. Please keep it well.”</p> 
 <p>“Oh, alright. Come, follow me.” Chris nodded to acknowledge the lady’s words, then gestured to Blue Maple.</p> 
 <p>---</p> 
 <p>Under Chris’ guidance, Blue Maple reached the fifth level. He saw a row of doors when he reached the fifth level, all marked by their room numbers. Evidently, these were the guest rooms. He was a little doubtful at this moment, but he didn’t voice it out.</p> 
 <p> Chris seemed to have detected Blue Maple’s doubts and explained to him as he walked behind him, “Sir, there are small subspaces behind these doors. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be enough space. The windows were also formed using subspaces. It’s just that there aren’t many windows if you look at the hotel from the outside.”</p> 
 <p>“Oh.” Blue Maple figured it out after hearing Chris’ words. To satisfy the accommodation needs of a large number of players, this hotel had to furnish things in such a way. Otherwise, its capacity would definitely be insufficient.</p> 
 <p>---</p> 
 <p>After walking along the long corridor for some time, they finally reached Room 507.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, sir. This is your room. You can go in directly. If there’s anything, just touch the red crystal behind the door and summon me. If you forget my name, you can just call for any waiter. The glowing green crystal is the switch for the lamp. Alright then, have a nice stay.” Chris bowed before he made his way out.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple entered the room. It was an ordinary room; rectangle-shaped, with a bathroom and furnished with simple decorations.</p> 
 <p>He only took a brief look at the room, not very concerned with how it was decorated. He stayed very silent. He was so silent that it was difficult to describe him right now.</p> 
 <p>After he finished looking at the room, he immediately walked to the window. He pushed open the window and peered outside. It was no longer dark outside, but was bright and clear instead. The scenery outside was colorful. Every street was lit up by yellow lamps. Some buildings were even shining brightly, with all kinds of lights.</p> 
 <p>The lights made everything feel so peaceful and harmonious. The hills in the distance could almost touch the sky. Above these hills were the starry sky. As the lights below were so bright, the stars paled in comparison. However, this didn’t make their glitter seem any less amazing. Blue Maple was quietly admiring this beautiful scene, and remained silent. Perhaps this was the most beautiful image that he had ever seen up until now...</p> 
 <p>“Perhaps, I should have come to this gaming world earlier. Even if it’s all an illusion...” Blue Maple muttered to himself.</p> 
 <p>“If everything in this gaming world, or even a part of it, was reality, it would be great...” </p> 
 <p>---</p> 
 <p>Blue Snow was saying something similar in another unknown hotel. She had also quickly found a hotel. It was just that it was a mystery whether she was looking out of the window, just like Blue Maple.</p> 
 <p>---</p> 
 <p><em>Earth... war, panic, fear, nightmares, evil...</em></p> 
 <p><em>Even the most powerful families wouldn’t be faring well. Maybe the next war would bring about extermination. Even the most prosperous cities will vanish under the next attack. The lights in the dark will be from the flames of bombs and explosives. The nights will no longer be illuminated by the glittery stars in the sky...</em></p> 
 <p>Blue Maple didn’t say anything as he just watched everything going on outside. He watched as lights went out and switched on. After a long time...</p> 
 <p>After a long while, Blue Maple lifted his head and asked gently, “Can the evil really enjoy such beauty?” as he peered into the starry sky. Blue Maple was no longer the same confused young man that he had once been. He was more like someone who had been through all sorts of turmoil. Perhaps he was indeed someone like that...</p> 
 <p>After that, he climbed onto the window ledge and started to crawl out. He easily made his way to the rooftop. Even though the hotel was built in an ancient European architectural-style, the rooftop wasn’t round like it normally was.</p> 
 <p>After he reached the rooftop, Blue Maple tried his best to get as high as he could. After that, he surveyed everything around him. The wider his view, the more beautiful it seemed. Everything he saw earlier was just a small portion of what he was seeing now. He was almost gazing upon the entire view right now.</p> 
 <p>He was silent as he looked at everything…</p> 
 <p>---</p> 
 <p>After that, he laid down on the rooftop. He was covered in darkness. Perhaps there was only some moonlight shining upon him.</p> 
 <p>He continued to gaze at the starry sky, as well as the full moon that he had missed earlier....</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple didn’t move as he laid on the rooftop. If not for the fact that his eyes were still open, one would suspect that he was sleeping.</p> 
 <p>As the city lights were extinguished one by one, Blue Maple got up and slowly returned to his room. It was impossible to know what he was thinking throughout this time.</p> 
 <p>---</p> 
 <p>After returning to his room, he switched off his lamp before lying on his bed. He went over everything that occurred throughout the day out of habit. This made him feel that a lot had actually happened over the entire day. First, he had killed the Demon Boss Slime that had mutated twice, and news of it was publicly announced.</p> 
 <p>After this, he met the weird and uncharacteristic old man. He was even sent to complete a rather difficult Hidden Class quest. He also met Blue Snow under ‘special’ conditions, and was assigned yet another difficult quest. As he didn’t eat anything, the hunger index that had been installed by the system led him to becoming more and more fatigued. <em>In fact, I haven’t eaten anything yet. Forget it, I’m just going to sleep. I’ll deal with it tomorrow.</em></p> 
 <p>After that, a few other things had happened because of the old man. Eventually, he even brought Blue Snow to the town, which was very uncharacteristic of him. He even met an interesting personality along the way. He still didn’t know whether he had completely passed his Hidden Class quest, however...</p> 
 <p><em>I’ll just take up some quest tomorrow for fun. At least I'll use this time before I get bored. Perhaps I won’t feel like doing anything in the future, once I lose interest in quests.</em> Blue Maple was a little self-condescending as he thought about the future him.</p> 
 <p>“Tomorrow...” Blue Maple muttered. After that, he opened up his attributes panel. In fact, Blue Snow had taken a look at his attributes out of fun on the way to town. However, she didn’t take a look at the specifics, she only saw the basic attributes. Even Blue Maple hadn’t taken a close look at his Passive, <em>Sword Heart</em>, yet. However, he wasn’t very concerned about his skills right now, but he guessed that there was a passive effect of boosted attacking strength. Otherwise, it wouldn’t make sense for Blue Maple’s attack power to rise so quickly.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple didn’t take a deep look at his more advanced attributes, like the detailed statistics regarding his mobility, jumping, height, night vision, and so on. Blue Maple took a look at his friends’ list that popped up after his attributes panel opened up.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple didn’t plan to meet anyone in the game. It meant that he had no intention of making friends. Given his perfectionist attitude, he felt that it was best that his friends’ list remained empty. However, there was the ID of a beautiful girl in it right now.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple clicked on her ID before choosing the ‘delete’ option.</p> 
 <p>“Please confirm if you want to delete ‘Blue Snow’ as a friend.”</p> 
 <p>“Yes” “No”</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple paused at the “Yes” option. He hesitated for a long time without clicking on it. After pausing for a brief moment...</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, never mind.” Blue Maple acted like nothing had happened before clicking on “No”.</p> 
 <p>After that, he closed the blue simulation control panel in front of him before going to bed.</p> 
 <p>------</p> 
 <p><em>The next day...</em></p> 
 <p>There was a group of bandits on a mountain to the north of a town called Aikhale. They often attacked businessmen and civilians that passed by, as well as harassing some of the villages nearby. For some unknown reason, the military did not attack these bandits, who were close to Level 30. They had been running riot, perhaps waiting for players to bring them to justice.</p> 
 <p>On this day, the trees and grass were so sparse that they exposed the rocks on the mountain. The mountain was strangely quiet. Even the gentle breeze could be heard. The cursing and screaming of the bandits that was so often heard on this mountain didn’t go on today. It was like the bandits were actually a myth over here.</p> 
 <p>However, the truth was that the bandits were not a myth. It was just that there was an uninvited guest.</p> 
 <p>The bandits’ cave was filled with corpses. The blood of these corpses had yet to dry. The heavy smell of blood filled the air. The gaming world made it seem so realistic...</p> 
 <p>“Why…why…are…you…so…strong…” The leader of the bandits, a Level 32 individual, struggled to say, just before he died.</p> 
 <p>A human boss wouldn’t demonize so easily. However, some traces of mutation could still be seen. In front of this powerful boss was a Level 17 player. Comparatively speaking, the player appeared much weaker. There seemed to be a huge gap between both parties, but the boss was actually the one who lost. This was even after the player had killed so many other bandits!</p> 
 <p>“You’re just not strong enough,” the player answered. After that, he retrieved the sword he had stabbed the bandit with. Fresh blood was still dripping from it, and blood also spurted out from the wound. The chief bandit was indignant as he collapsed slowly.</p> 
 <p>Even though this player was also ridden with injuries, he didn’t show any weakness at all. He had no lethal injuries. Otherwise, the player wouldn’t have survived the chief bandit. Perhaps he hadn’t even sustained any injuries before he fought the chief bandit.</p> 
 <p>“Indeed, killing is so much easier...” Blue Maple muttered to himself as he looked at the corpses on the ground. There was something in his eyes...</p>
