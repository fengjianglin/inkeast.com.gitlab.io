 <p>After half a minute, Blue Maple heard the washroom door open. After that, he saw a furious young lady walk out. She had seen him, too. She strode towards him.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple chose to remain quietly where he was as the young lady got closer and closer to him.</p> 
 <p>“Hooligan!” <em>Whap!</em></p> 
 <p>When the young lady got close to Blue Maple, she immediately slapped him. Blue Maple could have easily avoided it, but he didn’t. Although this was nothing to him, he knew that he deserved the slap.</p> 
 <p> Blue Maple just stared straight at the enraged and teary young lady, and said, “Are you going to continue?”</p> 
 <p>“You…” The young lady was stunned as she saw how composed he was. “You’ve seen a girl…but you’re still so composed. I, I must kill you, hooligan!” The young lady was infuriated by Blue Maple’s behavior.</p> 
 <p>The young lady drew her sword and immediately slashed it in Blue Maple’s direction. This time, Blue Maple still didn’t dodge her attack, even though he could have easily done so.</p> 
 <p>-5!</p> 
 <p>“How…” The young lady was shocked when she saw the almost negligible damage done to him, even though she struck his shoulder. She covered her mouth.</p> 
 <p>Blood streamed down from his shoulder……</p> 
 <p>“If you want to kill me, it’s better if you use my sword. Even though this is nothing to me, it might be different for you. I can only say that I’m sorry.” Blue Maple passed his sword to her, and removed the sword from his shoulder. More blood started to stream out.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the young lady also saw the attributes of Blue Maple’s sword…Rank 7 Bronze…</p> 
 <p>This series of actions left the young lady in a daze. She didn’t know if Blue Maple was really a shameless hooligan. or if he had truly accidentally entered the washroom.</p> 
 <p>After a brief moment, the young lady snatched her sword back. After that, she turned away from Blue Maple and rubbed her eyes a few times. She was fierce as she said, “Don’t you have to use it? Let’s talk after you come out.”</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple took a glance at the young lady. After pondering for a moment, he walked into the washroom.</p> 
 <p>After he entered the washroom, Blue Maple discovered that the lock was broken. It seemed like he had used too much force.</p> 
 <p>“No wonder…” It was why there was a creak when he first tried to open the door. He used his sword to hold the door shut.</p> 
 <p>---</p> 
 <p>Right now, the young lady was organizing her thoughts.</p> 
 <p>“Was that guy doing it intentionally or not? He actually forced his way in. He even broke the door. He even dared to say that he felt it was nothing. What does that even mean? Are the people from the place he belongs to all so shallow? Also, after he saw me, he actually… he actually remained so composed! I’m…furious!” The young lady stomped her foot.</p> 
 <p>“Also, why is the damage done so little! His sword is so good. It can’t be that his armor is so strong too, right? What is his level? His name and level weren’t even revealed.” The beautiful young lady was puzzled as she thought about it.</p> 
 <p>“Forget him. No matter, he is a hooligan. This issue isn’t over yet.” However, she was still infuriated. There was probably no girl who wouldn’t be furious over such a matter.</p> 
 <p>As for the damage done, it was naturally very low. The young lady was only Level 7. It was complete level suppression. This was on top of the fact that the attributes of her sword were very weak, and Blue Maple’s armor was top-quality. To most other players, the attributes of Blue Maple’s Bracers were too impressive!</p> 
 <p>Most people were around Level 5 right now. Although Blue Maple had risen in level very quickly, this was because he killed monsters beyond his level. He had too much experience from fighting monsters who were Bosses. The system even added two Levels to him. Most other players found it difficult to rise any further after they reached Level 3. Unless they teamed up to kill monsters when they reached Level 5, they found it even more difficult to rise in level.</p> 
 <p>There weren’t many players like Blue Maple, who killed monsters without sustaining any damage at all. Most people had to return to the village to buy medicine to heal themselves. There weren’t many coins in the Newbie Village, either. Even someone like Blue Maple, who killed monsters beyond his level, and they were even monsters around the perimeter of the central town, had less than two gold coins if his system rewards and the coins he took from the Bosses that he had killed were excluded.</p> 
 <p>Those two gold coins were the result of monsters around the central town dropping more coins because Blue Maple had crossed too many levels!</p> 
 <p>If this was in the Newbie Village, killing a Slime would only garner three bronze coins. As for higher-ranked monsters, they would only drop a dozen or so bronze coins. This was given the fact that the difference in ranks between the monster and player weren’t too big.</p> 
 <p>That was why the players didn’t earn much money, while the medicine in the Newbie Village was very expensive. The money from one fight wasn’t enough to buy much medicine. Eventually, one had to keep returning to buy medicine. The map covered a huge amount of ground. This greatly reduced the amount of time for training.</p> 
 <p>That this young lady could reach Rank 7 proved that she was already quite impressive. However, Blue Maple still didn’t think it was enough. Even though no one was as quick as him, there were still people whose skills were superior to him.</p> 
 <p>------</p> 
 <p>After some time, Blue Maple came out from the washroom. When he saw that the young lady was still standing there and appeared to be thinking of something, Blue Maple decided to question her.</p> 
 <p>The first thing he noticed was something he failed to notice earlier; her name was Blue Snow.</p> 
 <p>As for her level, Blue Maple had completely neglected it. It was something that he could ignore.</p> 
 <p>She was around a meter-sixty in height. Her hair was long and flowed all the way to her waist, and was black, soft, and smooth. Her body had just completed developing, and had a nice curvature to it now. Her hips were protruding and her waist was slender. Her skin was white and smooth. Her exquisite facial features accentuated her beauty. She seemed to have a natural dazed look, as she was deep in thought right now.</p> 
 <p>However, Blue Maple seemed to be able to resist such temptations. When he saw Blue Snow’s name, he couldn’t help but mutter to himself, “Blue Snow……”</p> 
 <p>“Oh?” Although he spoke softly, they were still very close to each other, so Blue Snow still managed to hear him.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, Little Gangster, why did you call my name? Come over, I need to ask you a few questions.”</p> 
 <p>“What questions?”</p> 
 <p>Blue Snow was a little embarrassed as she softly asked, “Did… you do that intentionally?” </p> 
 <p>“No.” Blue Maple responded with the same indifferent look on his face.</p> 
 <p>Blue Snow was staring hard at Blue Maple, as if she was trying to tell if there was something amiss. However, it was a pity that Blue Maple was completely unmoved. She couldn’t tell if there was anything wrong with him. She didn’t know if Blue Maple was being real or not.</p> 
 <p>“How do you explain the broken door then?”</p> 
 <p>“I have never opened such a door before. I was afraid I couldn’t open it, so I used more force.”</p> 
 <p>“You! Have you not read books from two hundred years ago? Don’t you know how to knock first?”</p> 
 <p>“Nope.”</p> 
 <p>“You are making me pissed! Idiot, hooligan! Until now, you still think you have nothing to do with this. Despicable!” Blue Snow was furious as she stomped her foot. Her face turned completely red.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve already told you, this is nothing to me. I’m only still here because of you.”</p> 
 <p>“Do you mean that you would leave if I wasn’t here?” Blue Snow was enraged.</p> 
 <p> Blue Maple was puzzled as he asked, “How can I not consider your presence?”</p> 
 <p>“…” Blue Snow was stunned.</p> 
 <p>“Hmph, disgusting. Let me add you as a friend. I shall settle this matter with you in the future.” As she said that, Blue Snow sent him a friend request.</p> 
 <p><em>Ding! <strong>Announcement</strong>: Player ‘Blue Snow’ has sent you a friend request. Do you accept?</em></p> 
 <p>“Can this be deleted by one party?”</p> 
 <p>“It’s best if you don’t delete it. If you delete it, I’ll know your name and I can settle scores with you.” As Blue Snow said that, she waved her fist at him.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple appeared to be in a difficult spot. Blue Maple didn’t want to add any friends in this game, he wanted to operate alone. This was especially true after the system announcement. However, right now……</p> 
 <p>“Why? Don’t you want to add me?” Blue Snow sounded a little threatening as she pressed him.</p> 
 <p>As he was helpless, Blue Maple could only shake his head slightly as he accepted her request.</p> 
 <p><em>Ding! <strong>Announcement:</strong> You have successfully added Blue Snow as a friend.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Ding! <strong>Announcement:</strong> You have successfully added Blue Maple as a friend.</em></p> 
 <p>The two announcements sounded in Blue Maple and Blue Snow’s ears at the same time.</p> 
 <p>“You are… you are the Blue Maple who killed a Rank 5 Demon Boss?!”</p> 
 <p>“No.”</p> 
 <p>“Ugh… nonsense. Your name is exactly the same!”</p> 
 <p>“It’s just a coincidence.”</p> 
 <p>“You! How can it just be a coincidence? You can’t choose the same name in this game.”</p> 
 <p>“Uh, perhaps there’s something wrong with the system.”</p> 
 <p>“You! You are a big liar. About the question earlier… you must have lied too!” Blue Snow was completely red right now, but no one knew whether it was because she was furious or embarrassed. However, she seemed rather cute in this state.</p> 
 <p>“No.”</p> 
 <p>Just as Blue Snow wanted to continue speaking, Blue Maple made a rare comment, “There must be something up, considering that you were so anxious to add me as a friend.”</p> 
 <p>“Ah, right, I need to complete my quest soon. There’s a time limit. You, you……hmph! I’ll go and complete my quest first. Watch out, hooligan!” After she finished speaking, Blue Snow rushed off like a gust of wind. She even shouted as she ran off, “Little Gangster! Stupid gangster! Gangster!”</p> 
 <p>“Oh, right! If you dare to tell anyone about what happened, I’ll not let you off!” Blue Snow turned around and roared before running off. At the same time, she grit her teeth and waved her fist at him.</p> 
 <p>“Okay…” Blue Maple appeared as if he hadn’t listened to Blue Snow at all. This left Blue Snow even more furious than before. However, she was in a rush and only snorted before leaving.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple remained where he was and thought to himself as Blue Snow rushed off. After that, he said something that would have left Blue Snow crazy, “Seems…pretty interesting…”</p> 
 <p>------</p> 
 <p>When the boss of the restaurant and village chief saw Blue Maple walking out, there were weird looks on their faces. Blue Maple was very nonchalant and indifferent. He didn’t know how Blue Snow would react when she came out.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple immediately walked towards the village chief and said,“Quest, reward.” He completely ignored the expressions shown by the village chief and restaurant boss. However, Blue Maple still looked at the boss. Everything was the result of thr boss’ forgetfulness.</p> 
 <p>The boss appeared a little uncomfortable as Blue Maple stared at him. He immediately twisted his head to one side.</p> 
 <p>“Ah, that. This is your reward!” the village chief spoke, immediately relieving the awkwardness of the situation. At the same time, he passed the reward to Blue Maple.</p> 
 <p><em>Ding! <strong>Announcement: </strong>Congratulations on completing the Grassland Bull Quest. Due to your outstanding performance, your level will increase by 1. At the same time, your physical rewards will be adjusted such that you can use them with your current level. Their attributes remain unchanged.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Ding! <strong>Announcement:</strong> Congratulations on rising to Level 14. You are awarded 5 attribute points that can be allocated freely.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Ding! <strong>Announcement:</strong> Congratulations on being equipped with the <strong>Cattle Ring</strong>.</em></p> 
 <p>===</p> 
 <p><strong><em>[Cattle Ring] (Rank 14 Iron)</em></strong></p> 
 <p><em>Strength: +10</em></p> 
 <p><em>Endurance: +6</em></p> 
 <p><em>Agility: +3</em></p> 
 <p><em><strong>Special effects:</strong> Increases damage to ordinary, wild bull-type monsters by ten percent. Wild, bull-type monsters increase damage to users wielding this item by ten percent.</em></p> 
 <p><em>===</em></p> 
 <p>He didn’t need to equip himself with the ring. Since it could be worn on his finger, he could just put it on.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple was also taking a look at his own attributes right now</p> 
 <p>===</p> 
 <p><strong><em>[Blue Maple] (Level 14 Newbie Swordsman)</em></strong></p> 
 <p><em>Attack: 205-221</em></p> 
 <p><em>Defense: 72-80</em></p> 
 <p><em>HP：352</em></p> 
 <p><em>MP：152</em></p> 
 <p>===</p> 
 <p>“Oh? I recall that my Bracer should be able to distinguish between guarding against material attacks and magic, right? Forget it, perhaps it’s because I haven’t switched classes.” Blue Maple was doubtful as he tried to remember</p> 
 <p>Indeed, Mages possessed skills after switching classes upon reaching Level 10. Naturally, there would be a distinction between material attacks and magic. Even though Blue Maple was only Level 14 now, and was also equipped with the ability to defend against magic, it wouldn’t show up in his basic attributes. It was his hidden attribute.</p> 
 <p> At this moment, the old man’s words sounded in his ears. “Hey, rascal. Go to the village entrance.”</p>
