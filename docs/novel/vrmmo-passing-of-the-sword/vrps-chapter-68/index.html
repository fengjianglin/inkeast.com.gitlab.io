 <p>“6000 gold coins!” someone from the fifth room shouted. Indeed, those who could rent the rooms were rich.</p> 
 <p>“Madam Kitty, we only have this many gold coins. Furthermore, you don’t need that ring. Surely you aren’t buying it for us, right?” The leader of the bunch in the fifth room was a beautiful young lady. The rest seemed to be her followers, as they sat around her in the room.</p> 
 <p>The young lady was a little domineering as she retorted, “Hmm, of course not. Don’t you guys think that the ring is very pretty? Furthermore, no one said it was a Warrior’s item. Why can’t I buy it?” </p> 
 <p>“Alright then…” Her followers didn’t know how to argue against her. No one could debate how pretty the ring was.</p> 
 <p>She was truly a bratty little girl. She was a blonde, but her hair was long and curly, already beyond her hips. She had a very cute face and her fair skin was also very tender. Her nose and lips were small, but her eyes were huge and round. She was almost flawless.</p> 
 <p>Her nose was actually sharp, but she wasn’t a genie. She was a cat woman! </p> 
 <p>She wasn’t even a meter and sixty centimeters in height, but she was voluptuous and her waist was very slender. She wore an exquisite set of leather armor and a small, little bow hung from the side of her shoulders. Due to her bratty behavior, she was absolutely like a ravishing little genie! However, she was in truth just a cat woman.</p> 
 <p>It was one thing Blue Maple was always very confused about: there was a 20% chance of picking another species, but there were very few other species on the streets. Most were human. Those that Blue Maple had met were all humans.</p> 
 <p>There was a 20% chance for a player to choose his species in the game. However, more than half of those chosen players still chose to be humans. After all, the other species were a little weird, apart from genies. How many of the other species – such as Earth spirits, beasts and midgets – fit the human idea of beauty?</p> 
 <p>In fact, the system actually gave a player two choices: one was to be a human and the other was a different species, but this species was pre-assigned by the system. A player didn’t have the freedom to choose the species he wanted to switch to. If for example, one felt that he was already short enough and he was given the choice to become a midget, would he choose to do so? Of course not. He would choose to remain a human!</p> 
 <p>That was why there were very few players that were of other species. After all, there wasn’t much difference in the overall attributes between players of varying species. Perhaps certain classes fit certain species better, but this wasn’t necessarily the case.</p> 
 <p>This lady was in luck. Not only was she given a rare species, it also happened that catfolk were very suitable as Archers and Thieves. The others weren’t as lucky as her.</p> 
 <p>“6200 gold coins!” White Lion bid.</p> 
 <p>“Hoo, fortunately the price isn’t rising quickly. We still have a chance.” White Lion heaved a sigh of relief. He had no choice. They simply didn’t bring enough money with them.</p> 
 <p>“6400 gold coins!” someone from the sixth room screamed.</p> 
 <p>“Mr White, do we really want this ring? It feels like we don’t have to risk souring our relationship with the guild.” Capricious Mr White and his followers were in the sixth room.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry. It’s just an auction. The guild isn’t so narrow-minded. After all, we are just bidding for fun. If the price gets too high, we’ll just stop bidding. We might even be able to earn some favors.” Capricious Mr White brushed off his follower’s words. He seemed to have conveniently forgotten that they had just pulled one over Paris Red Wine and taken the Silver-tier set components.</p> 
 <p>“Alright then. Is it true that these items are from that person we met yesterday?” The person asking the question was a Warrior named Shining Cross.</p> 
 <p>“Mmhmm. You know that I love Asian culture. That’s why I often take a look at Asian forums, especially China. I take a look at Korean and Japanese forums, too. Do you know what I saw in those forums?” Capricious Mr White asked mysteriously.</p> 
 <p>“What did you see?” Shining Cross’ curiosity was piqued and he ignored the auction that was going on. He wasn’t actually paying much attention to it.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know that fellow’s name. However, he’s originally from China. I don’t know why he went to Japan for a mission. I heard it was because of a beautiful female Priest. He offended the Common Guild in Japan, and was stopped at the city gates by more than seventy people from the guild.” Capricious Mr White took a sip of a drink and paused for a moment.</p> 
 <p>“What happened next? Was he forced out until he had to come to our city?” Shining Cross wasn’t wrong in thinking so. After all, how could a single person possibly challenge seventy people at one go? If he didn’t escape, he probably died!</p> 
 <p>“Could they stop him? He managed to rush out and completely overwhelmed them. They couldn’t even retaliate! He even unleashed terrifying blue fire to kill more than forty people. Hehe, if you holographically project that blue fire, you’ll be completely frightened. There were still twenty-some people left, but he was too lazy to kill them. They eventually fled.” Capricious Mr White took another sip of his drink after he finished speaking.</p> 
 <p>“This, this is… my God, how is there someone like that? Isn’t he affecting the balance of the game?” Shining Cross was completely astonished. It was written all over his face.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a little complicated. His fire was released beforehand. I guess it had to be accumulated first. I don’t think he’s that simple in real life, either. I’ll find the video for all of you to see later. Don’t think that he’s easy to deal with because he doesn’t have any protective equipment. He wasn’t hit even once during that fight!” Capricious Mr White was a little frightened as he continued speaking.</p> 
 <p>“Gosh, he’s not human! Shining Cross’ mouth was already hanging open.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, stop being so shocked. You’ll be even more astonished later. Take a look outside first. They’re about to fight.” Capricious Mr White gestured to everyone to look outside after he finished speaking.</p> 
 <p>“Bastard! What’s wrong with you, White Lion? Your guild doesn’t have any outstanding Warriors. Why are you challenging us for it?!” one of Dusk’s followers shouted. He should be pretty senior in rank, orhe wouldn’t have spoken. In fact, he was a vice-team leader. It was just that he wasn’t as strong as Dusk.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be angry. Just look at how beautiful this ring is. It can be given to a beautiful lady as a gift.” White Lion wasn’t angry at all. He responded very amicably.</p> 
 <p>“Stop squabbling. 8500 gold coins!” Dusk was a Thief. His tolerance was rather good.</p> 
 <p>As Capricious Mr White was speaking, the prices kept on rising. It was already at 8500 gold coins.</p> 
 <p>The young lady in the fifth room had already stopped raising her bids. She was out of money…</p> 
 <p>“Yeah, stop squabbling. Harmony is the most important. It’s just a ring. Come, let me add 50 gold coins. 8550 gold coins.” Paris Red Wine spoke like a mediator. Basically, he spouted some crap before he added 50 gold coins to the highest bid. Obviously, he was just delaying so that he could raise more funds.</p> 
 <p>His guild’s system was rather inconvenient. If the chairman wanted to find members, it could only be done by adding some of the senior members in the guild, who would then add other lower-ranked players as friends. This would continue on and on, which explained why the fund-raising process took so long.</p> 
 <p>After all, every player had to be independently contacted. Furthermore, some people’s intended usernames were taken by someone else. After all, there were 300 million people in the game. It was very difficult for there not to be clashing names. If not for the fact that Blue Maple was quick, he wouldn’t have gotten ‘Blue Maple’ as his username.</p> 
 <p>Furthermore, funds could only be transferred between friends if they were in the same city. If they were from different cities, some time was needed. The time needed depended on the distance between the cities.</p> 
 <p>“Red Wine, stop delaying. I’m bidding 10,000 gold coins!” Berserk Overlord was very clever. She could tell that Paris Red Wine didn’t have enough money. She decisively cut short the amount of time he had to raise funds.</p> 
 <p>As Berserk Overlord was normally very fierce, her followers raised funds very quickly to avoid incurring her wrath. This was an area where Paris Red Wine couldn’t compare to her, even though there were more people from the Red Wine Guild in this city.</p> 
 <p>“Eh, we are out of the running.” White Lion was the first to give up. They only had around 10,000 gold coins. They didn’t stand any chance anymore.</p> 
 <p>Paris Red Wine was silent now. Evidently, he was considering stopping.</p> 
 <p>“If I continue bidding, I probably won’t get the Gold-tier set. But if I don’t, I won’t know how much money that crazy woman has raised. It’ll be disastrous if I can’t even get the Gold-tier set.” He was indeed worried. The difference between the Gold-tier set and ring wasn’t very large.</p> 
 <p>“11,000 gold coins!” Dusk shouted.</p> 
 <p>“Keep your money to fight for the Gold-tier set equipment. I’m taking this ring.” Dusk’s bid was well-timed. If those two parties still wanted the ring, they would most likely have to give up on the Gold-tier set equipment.</p> 
 <p>“Hoo, fortunately Dusk still has money. It’s good as long it’s not the other two parties.” After all, Paris Red Wine and Berserk Overlord’s guilds specialized in Warriors. White Lion certainly did not wish for the ring to land in their hands. It was better for it to land in Dusk’s hands, since their chairman was an Archer.</p> 
 <p>“Fucking Dusk, I’m going to kill him!” Berserk Overlord was going mad. She clearly saw that Paris Red Wine was wavering, but Dusk disrupted her momentum at such a critical moment. It was no wonder she was infuriated.</p> 
 <p>“Calm down, chairman. It’s still good this way. At least we stand a higher chance with the set items later.” One of Berserk Overlord’s subordinates tried to calm her down at this point. He was really afraid that she would turn violent.</p> 
 <p>Their room was on the second level. Every room had a balcony, but people rarely went to the balcony. If she wasn’t stopped, Berserk Overlord might actually jump from her own balcony to Dusk’s balcony and start a killing spree, so her subordinate quickly calmed her down!</p> 
 <p>“Does anyone still want to bid? 11,000 gold coins once, 11,000 gold coins twice…11,000 gold coins thrice! Sold!” Leah signaled the end of this auction with a hammer.</p> 
 <p>“Congratulations to those from the third room on successfully winning the bid for this ring. We’re proceeding to our last item next. Come, ladies and gentlemen, tell me, are you excited?!!” Leah shouted with all her might, although it seemed like she was struggling a little.</p> 
 <p>“Yes!” everyone responded in excitement.</p> 
 <p>“Quick, I can’t take it anymore.”</p> 
 <p>“Aiyo, isn’t that Brother Toothpick?”</p> 
 <p>“You are a damn tailor then. Do you want to fight?!”</p> 
 <p>“Fight! Fight!”</p> 
 <p>“Fight!”...</p> 
 <p>Why did it feel like they were straying off topic…</p> 
 <p>“Seems like there’s nothing for us anymore. Come, let me show you the video.” Capricious Mr White ignored what was going on outside. He appeared very calm, as if he wasn’t affected by the atmosphere.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s just stick around. We don’t have to rush to leave.” White Lion was evidently bored.</p> 
 <p>“I’m so bored. Why isn’t it an Archer’s set?” The young lady was obviously unhappy that she had lost the ring.</p> 
 <p>“Hehe, at least we’ve gotten the ring this time.” Dusk was in a good mood. They were actually here for the Gold-tier set equipment originally. However, they didn’t bring enough money… but at least they got the ring!</p> 
 <p>However, a Gold-tier ring was much more expensive than a Gold-tier dagger. Apart from its value, the ring also had an extra Skill that came along with it. It was a life-saving Skill! Furthermore, a ring could be used for a long time!</p> 
 <p>Paris Red Wine and Berserk Overlord were going to be the only ones bidding for the Gold-tier set equipment. The rest were just joining in the fun.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s begin our auction of the last item now!” After Leah finished speaking, two beautiful NPCs carried out a tray covered with an elegant, purplish silk cloth. They placed it on the auction table.</p> 
 <p>The final auction was about to begin!</p>
