 <p>Blue Maple struck again and again, and didn’t retreat with each strike, entangled in battle with Tovilis. Blue Maple was very clear that Tovilis probably only had very simple intelligence now, and was probably relying only on his instincts. Blue Maple didn’t want to make that assumption before, as he was afraid that Demonized Tovilis was indeed intelligent, and was only faking it so that he could catch Blue Maple off-guard.</p>
 <p>However, Blue Maple had dealt such tremendous damage to him, and Tovilis was still waving his blade around hysterically. Blue Maple could now be sure that Demonized Tovilis didn’t have any intelligence to speak of!</p>
 <p>However, Demonized Tovilis still had some discipline as he swung his blade hysterically. He probably retained his basic fighting prowess, except he wasn’t using his abilities rationally. Blue Maple became even more fearless under such circumstances, and was basically dancing right beneath Tovilis’ blade.</p>
 <p>Demonized Tovilis’ blade came very close to Blue Maple’s body again and again, but he never touched Blue Maple, not even the corners of his clothes. Blue Maple was like a waltzing dancer as he flickered around Tovilis, while every strike scattered blood through the air.</p>
 <p>Tovilis’ blade continued to miss, and Blue Maple’s sword was like drifting snow. He was like a perfect dancer performing a spectacular dance, and his blade, shining with cold light, was just so eye-catching. Blood scattering in all directions was the best decoration in his performance, while Demonized Tovilis’ exasperated and infuriated cries were the most excellent sound effects!</p>
 <p><em>Little gangster is… so powerful…&nbsp;</em>Blue Snow stared unwaveringly at them, and didn’t even cover her wide open mouth, and her beautiful face couldn’t mask her tremendous surprise.</p>
 <p>“Bastard! I will kill you! Ah!”</p>
 <p>Demonized Tovilis used Warcry and tried to damage Blue Maple again. However, Blue Maple was like an agile cat as he snuck behind Tovilis in a flash and retaliated with a deep cut over Tovilis’ nape.</p>
 <p><em>-2878!</em></p>
 <p>Blue Maple had a thirty percent bonus to his movement speed, and was entirely capable of playing around with a foe who only knew how to use brute force. Even though Demonized Tovilis’ original speed was also quite fast, he was still a Warrior after all, and couldn’t be faster than a Swordsman who possessed similar attributes!</p>
 <p>Blue Maple’s sword left uncountable cuts and gashes across Tovilis’ body. Every spot that wasn’t covered with armor was stained with blood as the armor around his body started breaking apart and crumbling. Blood oozing with black hues flowed over Demonized Tovilis’ muscular frame. Blue Maple had cut off many of the spikes that Tovilis had created from his demonization process, and Tovilis was in bad shape.</p>
 <p><em>Clang!</em></p>
 <p><em>-1124!</em></p>
 <p>Blue Maple targeted Tovilis’ neck, but wasn’t in time to dodge Tovilis’ retaliation and was forced to block Tovilis’ Furious Slash. Blue Maple was hurt by the impact.</p>
 <p><em>Ding! <strong>Announcement</strong>: Your consistent damage against Demonized Tovilis has caused a severe loss of blood, and his attributes have declined by 10%!</em></p>
 <p>Blue Maple consumed a health Potion as he stared at Demonized Tovilis closely and thought, <em>Consistent slashing damage causing continuous loss of blood actually has this effect. Yes, it’s a game half-based in real life after all.</em></p>
 <p>They continued fighting with locked horns for another two minutes. Blue Maple dealt tremendous damage, and also took an instance of damage from an impact. Blue Maple’s total damage was 402,589!</p>
 <p>Yes, Blue Maple had dealt more than 400,000 damage within two minutes. That appeared impossible, but Blue Maple’s attack speed was 1.8 per second, and he could consistently strike once every second after accounting for situations where he had to evade or parry attacks. There was also bonus damage in between from Blue Maple’s Skills and from attacking Tovilis’ neck, which was a weak spot.</p>
 <p>One hundred and twenty seconds, which meant he averaged more than 2600 damage per second when accounting for his Skills. He had to inflict at least 300,000 damage. Furthermore, Blue Maple wouldn’t affect his basic attacks when he used his Skills. He could hit at least once per second, which meant he actually averaged 1.2 strikes per second!</p>
 <p>This meant Blue Maple would deal around 400,000 damage. However, Blue Maple only had two more minutes left for his explosive attribute bonuses.</p>
 <p>Even though Demonized Tovilis’ attributes were all lowered by 10%, Blue Maple didn’t think that he could successfully defeat Tovilis in the next two minutes. Tovilis’ last Skill was definitely not a simple one. That Skill was listed after Earth-Rending Chop, so it definitely wasn’t something that Blue Maple could easily deal with.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple had about sixty percent of his Heavenly Fire remaining. If Demonized Tovilis’ Skills completed their cooldowns in the end and he activated his final Skill, Blue Maple wasn’t confident that he could hold his own.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple required 30% of his Heavenly Fire’s total volume to defend himself against Earth-Rending Chop. Demonized Tovilis’ Earth-Rending Chop was also probably a stronger version, and 30% was likely inadequate if that was the case, not to mention Tovilis’ final unknown Skill.</p>
 <p><em>I hope his final Skill is something that changes his state or form. I’ll have a greater chance that way.&nbsp;</em>Blue Maple thought to himself, a little worried. Blue Maple could only take his chances that the unknown Skill was something that altered Tovilis’ state; its name seemed like it. Blue Maple would be in trouble if Tovilis’ final Skill was a high-damage Skill, and he would probably be killed instantly. Blue Maple and Blue Snow wouldn’t stand a chance if that Skill was a powerful single-target skill, if it was connected with Earth-Rending Chop!</p>
 <p><em>Whoosh...</em></p>
 <p><em>I can’t keep expending Heavenly Fire,&nbsp;</em>Blue Maple thought as he withdrew the flames covering his sword, even though Fiery Explosion did deal good damage. However, if Tovilis’ strange-sounding final Skill was something that dealt high damage, Blue Maple would definitely not stand a chance if he didn’t have ample Heavenly Fire to protect himself.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple’s Defense value was so pathetically low that it couldn’t even compare to a normal Wizard’s Magic Shield. Blue Maple would have to consume too much Heavenly Fire, even though it had impressive defensive capabilities. More importantly, Blue Maple couldn’t replenish Heavenly Fire and could only wait for it to gradually recover, unless he had a large energy source, such as unleashing an ocean of fire in a forest….</p>
 <p>Blue Snow watched Blue Maple withdraw his flames and could roughly guess what he was thinking about. Blue Maple had shared Demonized Tovilis’ attributes with her, after all, and she knew that Tovilis had another Skill that he hadn’t used. However, Blue Snow wasn’t like Blue Maple, and had enough gaming experience to know that Tovilis’ final Skill was something related to his state. Even then, so what?</p>
 <p><em>Little gangster’s bonuses are almost gone, and he will undoubtedly be suppressed if Tovilis’ state is amplified. What are we going to do? I can’t help him even though this is MY quest.&nbsp;</em>Blue Snow was starting to panic. She didn’t know that Blue Maple wasn’t actually worried, and he was withdrawing his Heavenly Fire just to be safe.</p>
 <p>Blue Snow didn’t know what was happening, and only knew that Blue Maple would only be left with his bonus from removing his Seal after his temporary amplification disappeared. Demonized Tovilis’ attributes would be greatly boosted when that happened, and he would suppress Blue Maple. There wouldn’t be only a superficial gap in their attributes, and Blue Maple’s attributes would be greatly suppressed!</p>
 <p>This meant Blue Maple wouldn’t be able to reach 2000 damage points like he did in the beginning, and he could probably only deal 180 damage. That was what suppressing hidden attributes would lead to, while the actual result depended on how wide the gap was.</p>
 <p>Demonized Tovilis watched Blue Maple withdraw his Heavenly Fire, and his eyes glowed with bloodlust as his belligerence was triggered once more. Fiery Explosion had made him suffer greatly, even though Heavenly Fire didn’t deal too much special damage to demonic creatures.</p>
 <p><em>Charge!</em></p>
 <p>Tovilis immediately used Charge. Blue Maple’s damage would be a lot lower than before if he didn’t have Heavenly Fire boosting his damage. Fortunately, Tovilis’ overall attributes were also lowered.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple chose not to face Tovilis’ Charge head-on this time. Instead, he chose his familiar sequence, and stepped sideways when Tovilis was nearing him with Charge and used Airborne Somersault to switch directions as he slashed Demonized Tovilis from his flank.</p>
 <p><em>Bam!</em></p>
 <p><em>-2130! -314!</em></p>
 <p>The result was the same as before. Blue Maple sent Tovilis crashing to the ground with a single strike on his flank!</p>
 <p><em>My damage has decreased by twenty percent without Fiery Explosion. I don’t think I can kill him within two minutes,&nbsp;</em>Blue Maple lamented a little as he thought to himself.</p>
 <p>Anyone who heard Blue Maple’s thoughts would probably scold him profusely. Blue Maple was at Level 39, and was trying to deal with a Rank 60 demonized Boss within five minutes. Even a team of one hundred normal Rank 39 players couldn’t do what Blue Maple was doing, although that didn’t mean one hundred players were collectively weaker than Blue Maple was individually.</p>
 <p>The reason was from the so-called suppression of hidden attributes from a demonized Boss twenty Ranks higher. Every normal player would face the same situation, and would deal less than two hundred damage to Tovilis if they struck him. He had five hundred points in Defense, so it would be true even if these players possessed 1000 attack damage. Furthermore, normal Level 39 players couldn’t possibly possess 1000 attack damage!</p>
 <p>Demonized Tovilis could kill a player in a team with one hundred players in one hit. Furthermore, this place was small and narrow, so Demonized Tovilis would probably eliminate a whole bunch of them with a single use of Earth-Rending Chop and push the rest into a very weak position.</p>
 <p>Blue Snow continued fighting around with Demonized Tovilis while Blue Snow contemplated how to help him from above. Rather, she was thinking about how to help him kill Demonized Tovilis.</p>
 <p><em>Should I stand behind Demonized Tovilis to evade Earth-Rending Chop? No matter how unintelligent Demonized Tovilis is, unleashing Earth-Rending Chop against a wall will still cover this entire area if he sees someone running behind him.</em></p>
 <p><em>Should I run beforehand? I couldn’t even outrun the Samurai Warlord’s Earth-Rending Chop, so how can I outrun Demonized Tovilis’ Skill?</em></p>
 <p>Blue Snow frantically thought of a solution that would work. Time continued to pass while Demonized Tovilis’ hit points decreased continuously. He was coming closer to his explosive outburst, and becoming increasingly violent and brutal. Blue Maple didn’t dare rely on his nimbleness to remain around Demonized Tovilis for too long, because he could potentially be instantly killed if Tovilis grazed him.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple’s amplification had one minute and thirty seconds remaining, but Demonized Tovilis still had 270,000 hit points…</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>Blue Maple had one minute left. Demonized Tovilis’ attacks had such powerful momentum and generated shockwaves so powerful that Blue Maple didn’t dare go near him so easily. Blue Maple’s strikes became less frequent, while Demonized Tovilis had 210,000 hit points remaining.</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>There were thirty seconds left. Blue Maple had found a small opening during one of their previous scuffles, and he hit Demonized Tovilis into the air before hacking and slashing furiously at him. However, Blue Maple’s Skills weren’t as powerful as before, and his damage wasn’t as high. Demonized Tovilis had 120,000 hit points remaining!</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>Blue Maple’s amplification was about to end. Demonized Tovilis’ health had declined to a dangerous level, and he only had ten percent of his initial health remaining: 80,000 hit points!</p>
 <p>Time was up!</p>
 <p>Blue Maple suddenly felt weakness course through his body as his bonuses suddenly disappeared. He felt a little uncomfortable with this sudden change, and swiftly put some distance between Tovilis and himself as he blasted Spatial Fiery Chop in Tovilis’ direction for one last helping of damage. Demonized Tovilis’ blood dropped to beneath ten percent of his original health!</p>
 <p>Demonized Tovilis suddenly descended into temporary silence as he lowered his head.</p>
 <p>Three quiet seconds passed before Demonized Tovilis suddenly lifted his head!</p>
 <p>“Ah, ah, ahhhh!!!”</p>
 <p>This wasn’t a mutation, and no shockwaves or forces were released. This meant…</p>
 <p>This was Demonized Tovilis’ final Skill: Imperious Fighting Spirit!</p>
