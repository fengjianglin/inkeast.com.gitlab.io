 <p>“Hahaha!!!”</p>
 <p>“It’s a pity the Holy Peacock King left us too early. Otherwise, I’ll unleash more terror on all of you.”</p>
 <p>“But it’s fine. The Terror Fortress will cease to exist from today onwards. Hahaha!!!”</p>
 <p>The Golden Roc cackled and shouted, giving no attention to his injured wings…</p>
 <p>He didn’t care about anything else. The only thing he wanted to do was to crush the strongest fortress, and also one of the twelve fortresses that belonged to the Demons – the Terror Fortress!</p>
 <p>“Feast of spells! Unleash!”</p>
 <p>“Glorious Demonic Fire! Burn!”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha!!!”</p>
 <p>“Destroy the fortress!!!”</p>
 <p>As the Golden Roc fluttered its wings and unleashed the Glorious Demonic Fire, the scrolls wrapped around the powerful energy undulations that were formed and flew towards different positions of the fortress. Some of these scrolls flew towards the scrolls that were unleashed by demons.</p>
 <p>“Boom boom boom!!!”</p>
 <p>A strong energy wave spread and destroyed anything that it touched. Even the tragic cries were buried by this wave…</p>
 <p>The archers and wizards barely struggled before they were completely exterminated…</p>
 <p>Even the Demon Crystal Cannons and Demon God Cannons were shattered, turning into a pile of debris…</p>
 <p>“Ahh!!! Hold on! Continue to maximize the strength of the spells! Hold on!” One of the three demons from earlier screamed in pain as he watched his fellow demons die.</p>
 <p>“Hang on! Or I’ll boil you to make soup!” Carogie threatened his subordinates.</p>
 <p>“The Bandit Demon God has already gone to prepare the Terror Descent. Victory is close!” The last demon out of the three tried to encourage his subordinates.</p>
 <p>Perhaps it would only work on slightly stronger demons. The weaker ones couldn’t even resist a minor blow. They were just turned into nothing.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha!!! Victory?! This is hilarious.”</p>
 <p>“Do you really think Valefor can maximize the potential of the Terror Descent by relying on a formation developed by Terror?!”</p>
 <p>“Worry about yourselves! Don’t forget, my Glorious Demonic Fire has only been fully initiated just as of now!”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! Glorious Demonic Fire, burn all evil in this world! Go!”</p>
 <p>The Golden Roc continued to cackle and mock. He completely ignored the imminent Terror Descent. He was only interested in revenge! And this would be achieved by destroying this fortress!</p>
 <p>When the three Demon Gods invaded, they seriously wounded him and left him helpless.</p>
 <p>Today, he returned to the Terror Demon God’s fortress. Even if he couldn’t kill the Terror Demon God as revenge, he still wanted to kill and destroy everything about the fortress!!!</p>
 <p>“Shing shing shing!!!”</p>
 <p>Scarlet-red fire was quickly released. Very soon, it filled the entire sky! It colored the skyline that made it seem like dusk. It was captivating…</p>
 <p>The fire resembled red clouds that covered the sky. The fresh-red, dazzling flames were enchanting…</p>
 <p>But it wasn’t gentle and beautiful red clouds, but…</p>
 <p>The strongest half-demonic fire that was intent on purifying the world from all evil!</p>
 <p>It was the…fire of phoenixes!</p>
 <p><em>That’s really the…phoenixes’…demonic fire…</em></p>
 <p><em>We are doomed…</em></p>
 <p>The three demons became much more afraid at this moment. They also lost all hope!</p>
 <p>“Ah…”</p>
 <p>While the demons were powerful, they were unable to withstand the barrage of attacks any longer. The magnificent red fire was their nightmare!</p>
 <p>It burned and destroyed their bodies and lives…</p>
 <p>Struggles, cries, terror, hopelessness…</p>
 <p>None of the demons were able to put up any meaningful resistance. Everything was quickly being destroyed and turned into nothing…</p>
 <p>The three demons were eventually killed and their bodies were charred.</p>
 <p>“Boom boom boom!!!”</p>
 <p>The scrolls were relentlessly attacking the fortress wall earlier. The cannons had all been ravaged.</p>
 <p>The indestructible Terror Fortress had been turned into a pile of debris. Everything was eviscerated as the horrifying energy storms ran riot…</p>
 <p>Lightning, fire, frost, meteorites, windstorms, earthquakes…</p>
 <p>All types of imprisonment spells were used to ravage this indomitable fortress. It was in ruins now…</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! Are you terrified? Useless beings, be terrified! I’ve brought your Terror Demon God his favorite thing – terror!”</p>
 <p>“Cough cough cough…”</p>
 <p>The Golden Roc laughed heartily. However, he was about to die, even if his body was strong. He had initiated so many spells at one go. Moreover, one of them was even a high-level imprisonment spell scroll.</p>
 <p>But it didn’t matter anymore. He was here to die anyway.</p>
 <p>He was going to drag the Terror Fortress down with him!</p>
 <p>“Ka ka ka…”</p>
 <p>Something strange was heard in void space as if something had crushed.</p>
 <p>That was the spatial seal that the Golden Roc had designed. It was targeted at the entire Terror Fortress. It could isolate any outer interference, but it was damaged by the terrifying imprisonment spells.</p>
 <p>But Blue Maple and the others were still fine. No one could sense him.</p>
 <p>“The undulations are so strong…that’s…in the direction of the fortress!” Old Man Fang was the first to sense it. He was drinking tea in a wayside pavilion.</p>
 <p>But he lost the mood to do so now.</p>
 <p>“That’s…the aura of the Frenzy Cyclone! The Golden Roc!” Old Man Fang quickly sensed from the information that he was given.</p>
 <p>“Let me see…fuck, what’s going on? That golden bird went to attack the fortress alone?!”</p>
 <p>Old Man Fang appeared as if he had seen a ghost. He was so astonished that he tried to sense further.</p>
 <p>“What the fuck. He even used the Glorious Demonic Fire. Don’t tell me he’s using that as well…fuck, am I going to be blamed in the end?”</p>
 <p>Old Man Fang wore a bitter look on his face. Then, a blue fire started to burn on his body before he disappeared…</p>
 <p>“Golden Roc…Terror Fortress…so this is it.” Old Man Wen also sensed it too. However, he was much more serious than Old Man Fang.</p>
 <p>Old Man Wen also disappeared from where he was.</p>
 <p>Other powerful individuals also sensed it too.</p>
 <p>“What a hero. Let’s help him.”</p>
 <p>“Reckless and arrogant. He’d rather die than to live in indignance.”</p>
 <p>“Let’s inform the rest. Those two old fellows should have gone. We can’t catch up to them. But we can stop any reinforcements to the fortress.”</p>
 <p>“Stop my ass. Apart from those two old fellows, who can go over so quickly? We should attack other fortresses to pile on the pressure.”</p>
 <p>“Seconded.”</p>
 <p>“Agreed.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>A battle between powerful characters was about to unfold just as the other players were unaware.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple was still watching the fight. He didn’t know anything about Old Man Fang and the rest…</p>
 <p>“Discovered? Hehe…it doesn’t matter. I should have enough time. Valefor is trying to initiate the Terror Descent. He’s distracted. These small fries are about to die.”</p>
 <p>The Golden Roc sensed that the spatial seal had broken, but he wasn’t too bothered by it.</p>
 <p>He was slowing becoming weaker. He was about to die.</p>
 <p>Valefor was in the same situation. He had also combusted his own life. He knew that the Golden Roc was sure to have a backup plan. He didn’t care about his survival anymore. Whether he managed to protect the fortress, he was still going to die.</p>
 <p>Only a small number of demons were still alive. They were the ones who weren’t on the wall.</p>
 <p><em>With these guys left, we still have a complete foundation and can still rebuild in a short time. However, they will also perish if we can’t resist that bird’s final attack or kill him. Whatever demons that are left over will also be completely exterminated.</em></p>
 <p><em>Fuck!</em></p>
 <p>Valefor thought to himself as he was about to initiate the Terror Descent. However, he was still very anxious knowing that the Golden Roc would have a backup plan.</p>
 <p><em>The spatial seal is broken? What’s the use now? At most, I can escape. It’s not enough to teleport the other demons away!</em></p>
 <p><em>I’m not sure if Barrias has called for reinforcements. But I don’t think I have a choice…</em></p>
 <p><em>Hahaha…if that bird is willing to release them, I’m sure they’ll have no way of passing any information. I was so stupid to bear heavy hopes that it would happen.</em></p>
 <p>Valefor was disappointed as he mocked himself. He knew that destruction was inevitable now.</p>
 <p><em>If that’s the case…</em></p>
 <p>Valefor’s expression changed slightly. He appeared to have thought of something.</p>
 <p>“Golden Roc! Show me what else you’ve got! Let the final attack rain down! I want to see how you resist the Terror Descent!”</p>
 <p>Valefor was ready to go all out before he died. He was a little like the Golden Roc earlier.</p>
 <p>It was laughable and sad at the same time. It was probably karma that he was about to suffer the same fate as the enemy who came here to sacrifice his life.</p>
 <p>“Valefor! Since you want to die so quickly, I’ll grant you your wish. I’ll let you know what’s true terror once more!”</p>
 <p>“You were probably not rattled by the fire earlier. In that case…”</p>
 <p>“What about this?”</p>
 <p>The Golden Roc opened his mouth and spat out another scroll. This scroll was deep-blue. It appeared extraordinarily dazzling. It was decorated in a very flowery manner too.</p>
 <p>When this scroll appeared, Blue Maple instantly knew who he belonged to.</p>
 <p>Sword Hermit – Fang Chen.</p>
 <p>“It’s…that Old Gangster’s imprisonment spell scroll! Why do you have it?!”</p>
 <p>Valefor was at a loss of what to do when he saw it. It was as if he had seen something terrifying!</p>
 <p><em>Fuck, this golden bird is going to use it! Fuck, those demons will target me next time. I’m already so pitiful. Now that there’s more trouble, I…</em></p>
 <p>Old Man Fang started to curse. He gave the scroll to the half-demons many years back. He knew that the Holy King was no longer around and the scroll was just a way for them to protect themselves.</p>
 <p>Then, the three Great Demon Gods invaded their territories. The Golden Roc knew that initiating the spell would be futile, which was why he absconded with it eventually.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! That’s right. It’s the Sword Hermit, Fang Chen’s scroll. It’s the scroll that left the entire demon race in fear. It’s the anti-imprisonment spell scroll – Heavenly Fire Sword Intent, Garroting Tornado!”</p>
 <p>The Golden Roc laughed in delight as he exclaimed. In fact, he didn’t say the full name of the spell…</p>
 <p>Valefor recalled the terror that ensued back then. When Old Man Fang used this spell many years ago, he only managed to escape by a stroke of luck.</p>
 <p>Old Man Fang fought more than ten Demon Gods back then. It was his ultimate imprisonment spell against the three Great Demon Gods!</p>
 <p>As Valefor thought about Old Man Fang…</p>
 <p>“Hahaha!!! So what if you have more people? Have a taste of my ultimate imprisonment spell – Indestructible Explosive Heavenly Fire Sovereign Sword Intent Garroting Terror Tornado!!!”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>When Old Man Fang used the spell against the Demon Gods back then, more than half of them were either seriously wounded or died. Old Man Fang sustained his own injuries from that fight then and went into a coma. He was then saved…</p>
