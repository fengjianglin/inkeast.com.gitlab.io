 <p>Subtle Nobleman was very nervous. Suddenly, a blinding ray of light emanated from the mirror. As it extended into the sky, it looked like a dazzling sun above the tower. In an instant, the tower seemed to have become a lighthouse.</p>
 <p>“Fuck, why is the initiation so awe-inspiring?” Subtle Nobleman was astonished. He used his arms to cover his eyes.</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>As this light shone, along with Blue Maple’s Heavenly Fire, the tower soon caught the attention of many players.</p>
 <p>“Quick, take a look! Look at the tower!”</p>
 <p>“Fuck, what’s going on? Have divine soldiers been born or something?”</p>
 <p>“Wait a minute, there seems to be a blue fire!”</p>
 <p>“Fuck! What? There’s even a blue fire? Don’t tell me it’s that guy?!”</p>
 <p>“That’s very possible. Didn’t you see the thread yesterday? That guy is back!”</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>Blue Maple released glaring, blue lights from his eyes too, and wasn’t affected by the light from the mirror. On the other hand, Subtle Nobleman completely shut his eyes and seemed to be very calm. He was completely relaxed, as if he was sleeping.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple and Subtle Nobleman rose from the tower and slowly floated into the air. They stopped about diagonally ten meters above the tower.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple furrowed his brow when he sensed the change.</p>
 <p>“It’s too attention-getting...” Blue Maple didn’t want people to notice what they were doing. He was already wary when he unleashed his Heavenly Fire. Now that the glaring ray of light had ignited and they were floating in the air, Blue Maple was feeling extremely vexed.</p>
 <p>The light slowly dimmed, and his Heavenly Fire also gradually dissipated. Both Blue Maple and Subtle Nobleman were revealed, and the other players managed to catch a glimpse of them.</p>
 <p>“Fuck, it’s really that guy. Who’s the other fellow with him? Don’t tell me it’s another powerful figure?” someone among the crowd below shouted. His words were the same as the others in the crowd.</p>
 <p>Commotions broke out and all sorts of guesses were made. Most of the guesses were right. The majority of the people believed that Blue Maple and Subtle Nobleman were initiating some kind of inheritance, and they were adamant that Blue Maple was the one helping out. This was because Blue Maple had proven himself to be very strong and mysterious.</p>
 <p>“Fuck, this is unbearable. How can he be so cool?! Fuck! When Creep is done, I must give him a good beating no matter what!” Fuck I’m Handsome grit his teeth in frustration. He couldn’t help it. It was in his nature to be jealous of someone else who was cooler and more handsome than him.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t technically jealous. It was more of the fact that his beauty was the only thing he had. Whatever it was, he couldn’t tolerate anything when it came to looks!</p>
 <p><em>Om...om...om...</em></p>
 <p>At that moment, a very gentle energy undulation was released from the mirror. It was like a wave as it spread through the air.</p>
 <p>As it gently ruffled Blue Maple’s coat, it also made Subtle Nobleman slowly open his eyes.</p>
 <p><em>Om!</em></p>
 <p>As Subtle Nobleman opened his eyes, a strong wave of energy erupted, and the Heavenly Fire was ferociously absorbed by the mirror. The light stabilized instantly.</p>
 <p>After the Heavenly Fire was completely absorbed, the mirror flared with blinding lights that shot diagonally into the sky. A black hole formed in mid-air.</p>
 <p>The revolving black hole seemed like it could devour all matter. However, Subtle Nobleman was only excited when he saw the black hole!</p>
 <p>This inheritance initiation was too formidable!</p>
 <p>Fuck I’m Handsome felt it the strongest. He believed that this Rank SS inheritance was stronger than his!</p>
 <p>Rank SS Bloody War Reverend, 19th among the Rank SS inheritances!</p>
 <p>Fuck I’m Handsome wasn’t happy with what he was seeing, but he had to admit that it was much more breathtaking than his own initiation. It also meant that this Rank SS inheritance was definitely stronger than his.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that Fuck I’m Handsome didn’t know the name of this Rank SS Class. Otherwise, he would be completely shocked.</p>
 <p>All-Conquering War Reverend, once known as the All-Conqueror. It was almost as good as a Rank SSS inheritance!</p>
 <p>As he had died in war and wasn’t in the mortal world, its rank dropped. This was why… the All-Conquering War Reverend’s rank was now first among Rank SS inheritances!</p>
 <p>Blue Maple was a newbie and wasn’t very focused on the details, which was why he was unaware. There was a simple reason why Blue Snow didn’t know: it was that she shared something common with Blue Maple, in that both of them didn’t bother with whatever they weren’t interested in.</p>
 <p>This was why she didn’t know any Warrior Hidden Classes, as she was only concerned about Swordsmen Hidden Classes. As she had mentioned, a Warrior class seemed very foolish to her and she didn’t like it.</p>
 <p>After the black hole was projected, a rusty, machine-like sound was heard. Everyone around could hear it.</p>
 <p><strong><em>“Class inheritance initiation, entering it will endanger your life! You still have a choice you can make. Are you going to enter the inheritance ground?!”</em></strong></p>
 <p>“Is there even a choice to make? Of course I will! I must possess such a powerful inheritance!” Subtle Nobleman shouted in response. At the same time, he seemed very emotional. His fists were clenched and already trembling with excitement.</p>
 <p>Just as Subtle Nobleman finished speaking, his body seemed to have been controlled by something invisible. He flew into the projected black hole. It was quick, like time was precious and not a second was to be wasted.</p>
 <p>“In that case, inheritance initiated! Life or death depends on you!” that rusty, machine-like voice sounded once again. Subtle Nobleman wasn’t given a chance to respond again. He was quickly flung into the black hole, but he still managed to squeeze a word out.</p>
 <p>“Fuck!” His voice disappeared into the hole...</p>
 <p>After that, the light from the mirror disappeared and it turned back into an ordinary Meteorological Jade Mirror.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the projected black hole also started to shrink and eventually turned into a blurry light projection. It was an old man. The old man bowed towards Blue Maple before disappearing into the sunlight.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple was still drifting in mid-air. However, he wasn’t being supported by the mirror. Instead, a talismanic platform formed from his Airborne Somersault had appeared.</p>
 <p>The blurry old man figure that eventually appeared probably bowed because of the talismanic platform. He had the aura of an old friend.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Blue Maple was teleported to the site of his second Class Advancement!</p>
 <p>------</p>
 <p>It was a pavilion. Old Man Fang was sipping tea under this pavilion.</p>
 <p>He didn’t seem like an old baddie right now. Rather, he appeared to be very melancholic as he quietly gazed at the teacup in his hand.</p>
 <p>“Has your inheritance been initiated, my old friend?” The old man mumbled to himself a little sadly. After that, he swallowed his cup of tea.</p>
 <p>------</p>
 <p>Blue Maple’s side.</p>
 <p>More and more people were watching from below. Blue Maple also knew that it was time to leave. In fact, he wouldn’t have helped Subtle Nobleman if he knew that it was going to cause such a huge commotion.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t in a good mood last night. His mood had turned for the better because of Subtle Nobleman. To him, the mirror was just another mirror, so he gave it to Subtle Nobleman as an expression of his gratitude.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple was about to leave.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple stared at where the black hole disappeared and muttered to himself, “Wang Clan’s only son. Interesting fellow.” Blue fire surfaced.</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p><em>Fuck, this is a good opportunity. This is a good opportunity to show how cool I am!,</em> Fuck I’m Handsome thought to himself excitedly.</p>
 <p><em>Fuck, there are so many people watching now. If I challenge this fellow and dominantly make my entrance, and finally… hahaha!&nbsp;</em>Fuck I’m Handsome was extremely delighted as he thought to himself. This was especially true when he heard some chicks talking below.</p>
 <p>“Wa, the Blue Fire Devil is so cool!”</p>
 <p>“Does he have a girlfriend?”</p>
 <p>“Brother Blue Fire, I want to bear your babies!”</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>Just as Blue Maple was about to complete his teleportation, Fuck I’m Handsome made his move.</p>
 <p>“Hey! Do you dare to fight me?!” Fuck I’m Handsome shouted with all his might, so everyone could hear him.</p>
 <p>He unleashed his aura. His bloody aura engulfed all the players, suffocating them. At the same time, blood-red fog was released from his armor!</p>
 <p>He then made a dominating flip to the top of the tower, confronting Blue Maple from below.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple was puzzled as he glanced at Fuck I’m Handsome. He didn’t know what he wanted. He was about to leave, but Fuck I’m Handsome shouted at him like that. Blue Maple was relieved that it didn’t stop his teleportation.</p>
 <p>“This is also an interesting fellow. But...” Blue Maple suddenly found it very funny as he looked at Fuck I’m Handsome. However, Blue Maple wasn’t going to agree to the fight.</p>
 <p>Even if he wasn’t bothered by how others thought about him, it didn’t mean that he was a pawn to be used. So...</p>
 <p>Blue Maple formed a fireball from his Heavenly Fire and stared at Fuck I’m Handsome provocatively. Then, he popped the fireball!</p>
 <p>He disappeared along with his fireball!</p>
 <p>“Ugh...”</p>
 <p>Fuck I’m Handsome stood there above the tower awkwardly. As the chilly morning wind blew against him, he appeared just like… an idiot!</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>“Who’s Fuck I’m Handsome? How dare he challenge the Blue Fire Devil? That’s so laughable. He didn’t even respond to him and just left.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, he’s just an idiot, even though he appears pretty strong. Hahaha!”</p>
 <p>“Retard. Didn’t he see how much fire was used to aid in the initiation? He chose such a time to challenge the Blue Fire Devil. How shameless can he get?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. He’s not even as cool as Brother Blue Fire, but he still tried to act cool by flipping onto the top of the tower!”</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>Whether it was a man or woman, they were all mocking Fuck I’m Handsome after what Blue Maple did.</p>
 <p>Instantly, Fuck I’m Handsome realized that his efforts to act cool were in vain, and he had even embarrassed himself completely!</p>
 <p>“No!!!” Fuck I’m Handsome screamed internally, just like Subtle Nobleman had reacted in the bar.</p>
 <p>Finally, he snuck away...</p>
 <p>------</p>
 <p>Blue Maple was strolling leisurely through a dense forest to the east of Azeriya. He randomly chose a Rank S quest and gathered a bunch of medicinal herbs. He was probably going to kill another Boss, who was probably not going to be as strong as the Snow Wolf King.</p>
 <p>However, he was just out to catch a breather. Killing a Boss was a relatively easy task for him.</p>
 <p>Some fighting noises caught his attention suddenly. Since he was bored, he didn’t mind going over to take a peek. Although he wasn’t a Thief, he was still very confident in his ability to hide. Moreover, the forest was very dense.</p>
 <p>He wandered over to where the fight was happening.</p>
 <p>However, he was momentarily stunned when he got to the fight. Given his character, he had to be seeing something really special if he could be stunned.</p>
 <p>He saw a beautiful lady completely covered in dark blue leather armor fighting an injury-stricken brown bear Boss.</p>
 <p>That dark-blue figure resembled a mirage. It was like there was an… alluring spirit!</p>
