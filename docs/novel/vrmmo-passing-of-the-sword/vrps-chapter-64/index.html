 <p>Every Spatial Fiery Chop caused more than 1000 damage. The concentration of Spatial Fiery Chops coupled with the terrifying strength of the Heavenly Fire blew the Treant King’s HP to rock bottom almost instantly!</p> 
 <p>It was almost like that 10,000 HP was a complete lie. It didn’t hold up in the face of Blue Maple’s destructive attacks. The sea of blue fire catalyzed the formation of countless Spatial Fiery Chops that eventually led to a complete extermination!</p> 
 <p>The Treant King stopped its struggle as its HP were wiped out. It was like an ordinary tree about to wither. It was slowly burned by the Heavenly Fire, and its branches started to crack. Eventually, they broke off and dropped onto the ground.</p> 
 <p>In just a while, the huge tree collapsed, and flames spewed everywhere. The broken tree branches were all aflame, while the leaves that were still burning scattered everywhere.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple was very calm as he sipped on his drink. He walked towards the collapsed Treant King. He came across a huge pile of gold and silver coins. He was shocked that they were still in good condition despite the raging fire.</p> 
 <p>He threw his drink holder into the fire after he finished it and let it combust. After that, he flipped through the equipment that had dropped. If the coins were intact, the equipment had to be fine too.</p> 
 <p>Three pieces of equipment appeared in front of his eyes.</p> 
 <p>===</p> 
 <p><em><strong>[Ring of Nature] (Rank 45 Gold)</strong></em></p> 
 <p><em>Strength: +55</em></p> 
 <p><em>Agility: +42</em></p> 
 <p><em>Endurance: +60</em></p> 
 <p><em>Intelligence: +20</em></p> 
 <p><em>Attached Skill – Force of Nature: Restore 1000 HP in 10 seconds (60 seconds cooldown)</em></p> 
 <p><em>===</em></p> 
 <p><strong><em>[Treant Helmet] (Rank 45 Gold Set Equipment)</em></strong></p> 
 <p><em>Defense: 221-286</em></p> 
 <p><em>Strength: +15</em></p> 
 <p><em>Endurance: +40</em></p> 
 <p><em>Toughness: +27</em></p> 
 <p><em>HP: +200</em></p> 
 <p><em>Set Equipment Attributes: Additional 200 HP will be added with every increment in components. At the same time, HP can be restored every 8 seconds and up to 250% restoration of basic HP can be achieved.</em></p> 
 <p><em>===</em></p> 
 <p><strong><em>[Treant Battle Skirt] (Rank 45 Gold Set Equipment)</em></strong></p> 
 <p><em>Defense: 187-236</em></p> 
 <p><em>Strength: +15</em></p> 
 <p><em>Endurance: +35</em></p> 
 <p><em>Toughness: +21</em></p> 
 <p><em>HP: +200</em></p> 
 <p><em><strong>Set Equipment Attributes</strong>: Additional 200 HP will be added with every increment in components. At the same time, HP can be restored every 8 seconds and up to 250% restoration of basic HP can be achieved.</em></p> 
 <p>===</p> 
 <p>“None of them suits me,” Blue Maple lamented. It was only someone like him who was so unbothered by tangibles that would ignore such Gold-tier equipment. There were even Set Equipment components! There was a Gold-tier jewelry! Even if he didn’t want it, he could still sell it for a high price.</p> 
 <p>After checking whether there were any other dropped items, he was prepared to proceed to selling his stash of equipment. He was really in luck these two times. It was important to know that one Gold-tier equipment dropped the last time he dueled a Boss. This time, there were three. They were even Set Equipment components and a ring!</p> 
 <p>Comparatively speaking, this was better than the drop rate of the Jiangshi King. However, Blue Maple thought that the equipment was inferior in this instance. At least he had one item he could use with the Jiangshi King. However, his level was still too low and he couldn’t use it temporarily.</p> 
 <p>He glanced at the tree that was yet to finish burning. He thought that it was good that he razed the place down and created such a huge empty patch. Otherwise, he was really unsure how he was going to control the spread of the Heavenly Fire. He might be able to if there wasn’t any combustible material. However, there were leaves and branches. If he was any further away, he might actually be unable to control the fire.</p> 
 <p>He took a look at the Heavenly Fire that was still burning before he started absorbing it back.</p> 
 <p><em>Managed to replenish what I drained earlier. I can even use it to teleport back,</em> Blue Maple thought to himself as he reabsorbed his Heavenly Fire.</p> 
 <p>All the fire within a hundred-meter radius started to gather towards him. It was just like it was at Gong Liang City. This time, the fire was even stronger. However, there was no true killing intent about it.</p> 
 <p>In just a moment, all the Heavenly Fire disappeared, along with Blue Maple. What was left behind was only a charred patch of ground and ashes.</p> 
 <p>======</p> 
 <p><em>Aika City Auction House...</em></p> 
 <p>Blue Maple expended a lot of effort to find this auction house. It wasn’t that he was bad with direction navigation, it was just that he didn’t buy a map. The system provided free maps of the Newbie Village and Town, but not for cities. However, there were places where such maps were readily available, such as the Mercenary Union.</p> 
 <p>The only electronic map that Blue Maple had was a route map he got after he submitted a quest. However, it wasn’t the entire map of Aika City, so he took a long time to find the auction house. He even went to submit his quest first.</p> 
 <p>“Rather grand.” Blue Maple was impressed when he saw the exterior of the auction house.</p> 
 <p>If the Mercenary Union appeared to be overwhelmingly imposing, then this auction house had to be described as luxurious and pompous.</p> 
 <p>The architectural style of the building was splendidly grand and opulent. The golden tiles were especially apt, as the building followed a European architectural style. After they were pieced together to construct this palatial structure, it seemed like the building was the epitome of ‘a dazzling sight’.</p> 
 <p>However, Blue Maple didn’t admire the building for long. He wasn’t too interested in something like that. It was more important for him to tend to urgent matters. He immediately walked through the front door.</p> 
 <p>After entering the main hall, a beautiful European NPC came over and welcomed him. She was evidently a service staffer. Her dressing was on point and fit the style of a European. However, Blue Maple wasn’t interested at all. He didn’t take notice of her appearance or attire.</p> 
 <p>“Hello, are you here to sell your equipment? I can settle it for you if they are Silver-tier or lower-ranked Gold-tier equipment.” The NPC smiled at him. When it came to this aspect, the auction house trumped the Mercenary Union. After all, it was very focused on earning money.</p> 
 <p>“Many Silver-tier and a few Gold-tier. Oh yes, I also have Set Equipment.” Blue Maple casually mentioned. He only added the second sentence after he suddenly thought about it. He almost forgot that Set Equipment was more expensive.</p> 
 <p>“So many?! And there is Set Equipment too?!” The NPC’s smile turned into astonishment as she covered her mouth. After that, she regained her decorum and immediately restored her smile.</p> 
 <p>“Distinguished guest, please follow me.” After she finished speaking, she gestured for him to walk further down the hall.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple followed her steadily. He didn’t notice how astonished the other players were.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, take a look. That Asian person has been invited in. Don’t tell me he’s going to sell something really valuable?”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, I’ve not seen someone being invited in before. Don’t tell me there’s really some great stuff this time?”</p> 
 <p>“Quick, inform our head. Oh no, inform our chairman! There must be something good if he’s been invited in. These ordinary NPCs directly dealt with the Gold-tier equipment that our head tried to sell the last time!”</p> 
 <p>===</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple didn’t know that he had caused a mild uproar in Aika City. However, he wasn’t bothered about it at all. After all, he was only trying to sell some items, he wasn’t doing anything weird. Could they really come over and rob him? There wasn’t a need to, since killing a player for no reason wouldn’t lead to any dropped equipment. Furthermore, they were in the city. Killing someone was a crime, and the killer would be arrested by troops.</p> 
 <p>“Miss Leah, we have some big business!” the NPC called out after they went further down the hall. She was talking to her superior.</p> 
 <p>Another beautiful NPC appeared in front of Blue Maple. However, her figure was even better than the first woman. Her style of dress was also much more attractive. Clearly, she was a more desirable lady.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple was feeling a little lamentable as well. Salespeople were naturally of higher quality. The NPC also left after she brought Blue Maple to her superior.</p> 
 <p>“Woah, is it a business by this handsome guy. Come, take a seat.” Miss Leah considerately invited Blue Maple to take a seat. The chair was one of the more comfortable ones.</p> 
 <p>“I wonder what you’re trying to sell?” Miss Leah didn’t do anything seductive. However, any passionate young man wouldn’t be able to resist her charm.</p> 
 <p>However, it did seem like Blue Maple was immune to it……</p> 
 <p>“Many Silver-tier, a few Gold-tier. Set equipment too.” Blue Maple’s reply was just about the same as he said to the NPC earlier. Even his tone of voice was the same. It was like he was unmoved by anything.</p> 
 <p>His indifferent response left Leah a little astonished. His willpower was beyond ordinary people. He was tempted even the slightest bit.</p> 
 <p>However, Leah was much more experienced than the NPC earlier. She didn’t reveal too much of her emotions. She composed herself quickly.</p> 
 <p>“Can our appraiser take a look at them?” Leah smiled and asked politely. It was very difficult to describe it, but her approach was much more welcoming than the NPC, even though their smiles were equally cordial.</p> 
 <p>“Yes.” Blue Maple remained unmoved.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, wait a minute then.” Leah got up and found an appraiser. Blue Maple didn’t take the opportunity to look around. He realized that they were just some elegant decorations after glancing around for a moment earlier. It seemed like this wasn’t the place where the best treatment was given yet.</p> 
 <p>Leah soon brought an old man over. They were wearing the same style of uniform.</p> 
 <p>Before he was even asked, he retrieved a complete Treant Set Equipment, as well as some Gold-tier equipment that he didn’t fancy. Of course, there were also the two extra Gold-tier Treant Set Equipment components. Unless there was some kind of special situation, the Set Equipment could only be dropped from a Treant King.</p> 
 <p>The old man started to appraise the items.</p> 
 <p>“This Silver-tier equipment is top-quality piece for Warriors. It’s very practical. It should have dropped from an evil Treant.” The appraiser was in awe as he touched the Treant Set Equipment. He was also dazzled by what he saw. His appraisal was also right on point.</p> 
 <p>After this, he turned his attention to the Gold-tier equipment. There were more than ten of them. However, his attention was quickly drawn by two which had the same style. Yes, they were the helmet and battle skirt.</p> 
 <p>“Are, are they Gold-tier Set Equipment components?!” The old man’s voice was trembling. He was clearly a little excited now. Leah was also astonished and covered her mouth. They didn’t expect Blue Maple to possess the Gold-tier Set Equipment components.</p> 
 <p>It was important to know that if the components were available, an entire set was perfectly possible.</p> 
 <p>“Given their attributes, the set equipment is certainly a top-quality Warrior Set Equipment before the third class advancement. It’s a pity that there are only two components. It seems like that they must have dropped from an even stronger Treant King. You are so impressive even though you’re young. You even beat a Treant King!” The old man was stingy with his praises. However, English was different from Mandarin; there weren’t as many complimentary phrases, so the old man didn’t use any bombastic vocabulary to compliment Blue Maple.</p> 
 <p>“Hmm, these Gold-tier items are rather good too, especially this dagger. Its decaying effect is valuable in a team.” The old man was still as impressed as before. It seemed like the dagger could fetch a high price.</p> 
 <p>“These items are all pretty good. Let’s not even talk about the Set Equipment. The ordinary ones are also good. Oh yes, I heard you have many Silver-tier equipment too. Do you have any other Treant equipment?” the old man asked abruptly.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, I have a bunch of them,” Blue Maple answered. He promptly retrieved whatever he wanted to sell from his backpack.</p> 
 <p>A pile of Silver-tier items appeared in front of Leah and the old man. There were at least sixty to seventy items. This was even after Blue Maple didn’t pick up some of the items that had dropped on his quests.</p> 
 <p>Leah and the old man were stunned now.</p>
