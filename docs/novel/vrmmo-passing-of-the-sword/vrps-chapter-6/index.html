 <p><em>This skill seems to be rather good. </em>After this, Blue Maple looked around. He discovered that there weren’t any Slimes around and felt that it was a pity.<em> It’s a pity there aren’t any Slimes around for me to test this skill. Otherwise, I could test how good it is when it’s unleashed. </em>Blue Maple had always been fascinated by things that he had not tried before.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t know what to do now. “It seems like my level is a little too high now. I won’t be able to gain any XP, even if I kill a Slime now. If I go to Advanced Monsters Area, I must walk a long way. After all, the Slimes seem to cover a huge area. There are still Rank 4, 5, and 6 Wild Monsters Areas. Won’t I be wasting too much time if I walk?”</p> 
 <p>“Should I go back and ask the Chief how I can get to the town? However, it seems like I need to be at least Level 10 to teleport to the town. This is so troublesome! I didn’t expect leveling up to be such a bad thing. What should I do? Should I follow the original plan and kill monsters all the way back to town?”</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple, who was very decisive, immediately made up his mind after pondering for a while. He returned to the Newbie Village to find the Chief. From the map, it seemed like returning to the Newbie Village made more sense to him. After all, the electronic map didn’t indicate how far it was to the next town, even though it pointed out the general direction. He couldn’t determine the exact distance. The current electronic map only revealed him to be at the center of the publicized map, and a two thousand meter radius extending from him. Nothing beyond this radius would be shown and nothing that was not publicized would be revealed, either. However, the current publicized map revealed the general direction of the major points of interest.</p> 
 <p>After Blue Maple decided to return to the Newbie Village and was about to rush back, he suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p> 
 <p>Someone appeared in front of him without any warning. It was an old man! He was dressed in ordinary linens and had sharp facial features. His messy hair was half-black and half white. He appeared just like an old man from the old days. However, he was smiling from ear-to-ear as he looked at Blue Maple. The look on his eyes was a little dubious. Blue Maple felt that the old man wanted to hit him.</p> 
 <p>Clearly, this old man wasn’t a player. He was just like the villagers, an NPC!</p> 
 <p>“Is there something you have for me?” Blue Maple could tell that this old man wasn’t ordinary. At the same time, he could tell that the old man was here for him. Although he didn’t know the reason, he still probed.</p> 
 <p>“Hehehe, of course I have something for you. Otherwise, why would I be here?” The old man had a cheeky smile as he replied. At the same time, he seemed to be sizing Blue Maple up as he said, “Oh, not bad. I didn’t expect such an outstanding person in such a rural area. Ah, at least I didn’t waste my time coming over to check on things after sensing some demonic undulations. Oh, you are really not bad. I’m in luck. I didn’t expect such good fortune after losing a bet. Hehehe…”</p> 
 <p>Just as the old man was sizing Blue Maple up, Blue Maple also sized him up at the same time. Eventually, the feeling that he got was… the old man was just a weird person and the things he said were just weird.</p> 
 <p>Just as Blue Maple was pondering whether he should ignore the old man and walk away, the old man stopped him and asked, “Hey, rascal, did you kill that thing over there yourself?”</p> 
 <p><em>That thing? He should be talking about the Slime King. </em>Blue Maple replied without any expression on his face, “No.”</p> 
 <p>“Ugh……” The old man’s expression immediately turned gloomy. After this, he retorted, “Hey! Rascal, you are the only person here. If it wasn’t you, who was it? Ah?!”</p> 
 <p>“Oh, I think someone got rid of it before he walked off.” Blue Maple still appeared as nonchalant as ever as he responded. He even twisted his head to one side to indicate where the imaginary person went.</p> 
 <p>The old man was furious, “If there was someone else when I came, would I not have known? Within a twenty-kilometer radius, there’s only you and a few other foreign boys, and we are the only ones here! Let me tell you, if anyone was near me, I couldn’t possibly not know about it! Uh…” The old man seemed to have realized that he had inadvertently revealed something. He immediately shut his mouth.</p> 
 <p>“Ah, that… hey! Rascal, what’s with that expression!” Just as the old man re-organized his thoughts and was about to ask Blue Maple something again, he realized that Blue Maple looked very skeptical. This made him even angrier.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple was still doubtful as he watched the old man. There was even a hint of scorn in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>The old man was a little annoyed when he saw Blue Maple acting like this. “Stop acting! You are the one who killed that Slime King, right? Even if I shut my eyes, I’d know something like that. Hey, young kid, don’t you want to get to the town? I can help you.”</p> 
 <p>As he faced the doubtful Blue Maple, the annoyed old man said once more, “Let me tell you, I have been alive for such a long time. How can I not tell something like this? How about that? If you help me with something, I’ll send you to the town.”</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple asked, “Why me?”</p> 
 <p>The old man responded, “You are mystical and spiritual… eh! Hey, young kid, don’t go. I was just kidding.” In mid-speech, the old man changed his tone when he saw Blue Maple ignoring him and walking away.</p> 
 <p>After he finished speaking, the old man rushed in front of Blue Maple and stopped him.</p> 
 <p>“That’s quick. Is that instant teleportation?” Blue Maple was a little astonished when he saw the old man was now in front of him.</p> 
 <p>The old man continued, “Young people don’t have to be so rushed. Don’t you know to respect the elderly? You simply walked away before I finished talking!”</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple replied, “I don’t want to listen to you.” Although he was astonished, he didn’t want to reveal it.</p> 
 <p>The old man didn’t know what to say.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple immediately walked away after he finished speaking. The old man was anxious as he watched Blue Maple leave. “Excellent rewards!”</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple still continued on his way.</p> 
 <p>The old man was even more anxious as he said, “Let me teach you a powerful skill.”</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple was still as unmoved as ever. Blue Maple wasn’t interested in anything. He was completely disinterested in the game. Why would he be interested in something like that?</p> 
 <p>The old man continued to persuade Blue Maple after seeing that his offer had no effect, “What do you want then? We can negotiate.”</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple continued to ignore him.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that Blue Maple was completely unmoved, the old man was a little regretful as he shook his head and sighed, “Haih, it’s so difficult to accept a disciple in this era. Usually, people are begging me to be my disciple. But I can no longer tempt anyone now. Should I be acting more seriously? Haih……”</p> 
 <p><em>Accepting a disciple? </em>Although Blue Maple was a distance away, he could still hear what the old man said. Suddenly, he stopped. At the same time, he recalled the summary for one of the classes. Certain classes had their own special characteristics, which seemed to be different from ordinary classes.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple immediately paused when he realized that. He had jumped to the summary and proceeded to the next page of content, so he knew that some classes were a little special. The educators for those kinds of classes could only be met by chance. One could start those classes after completing a quest. As for other information, he was unsure.</p> 
 <p>As Blue Maple had always been interested in special things. He stopped and turned to face the old man.</p> 
 <p>The old man was stunned as he looked at Blue Maple. He didn’t know what was going on and probed, “Have you thought of something?”</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple asked, “What type of class can you make me become?”</p> 
 <p>The old man reacted, “Uh……” He was completely unsure of what was going on.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple continued to ask without giving any care to the old man, “Speed, strength or defense? Or magic?” Blue Maple was someone who hated defense. If the old man was someone who coached people in defense, then Blue Maple would immediately turn around and leave.</p> 
 <p>“Hehehe.” The old man was a little cheeky as he chuckled. It was like he had completely changed.</p> 
 <p>Just as Blue Maple was puzzled about the sudden change to the old man’s behavior, the old man suddenly revealed a domineering aura. His cheeky laughter disappeared and he immediately turned serious. After this, an overwhelming and mighty gust of air instantly smoked out from the old man’s head. It engulfed the entire place and caused everything around to shake. It was like a tornado unraveling.</p> 
 <p>Everything around seemed to be groaning. The glaring sun instantly darkened, and it seemed that everything in this world was focusing on the old man. Everything around seemed to be bowing down to the serious old man.</p> 
 <p>The raging winds were relentlessly tugging at the old man’s shirt, as well as messing up his beard. A strong beam of light shone from the old man’s body, forcing Blue Maple to shut his eyes. At the same time, Blue Maple heard the old man’s commanding voice!</p> 
 <p>“I am the controller of swords. I can wield every sword in this world.</p> 
 <p>“For the wielder of swords, his blade can tear open heaven and earth.</p> 
 <p>“For the wielder of swords, his connection with his swords can destroy any weakness.</p> 
 <p>“For the wielder of swords, his sword spirits can reach anywhere.</p> 
 <p>“The blade of my sword enables my sword to remain concealed in this world.</p> 
 <p>“The heart of my sword enables my sword to assimilate with this world.</p> 
 <p>“The spirit of my sword enables my sword to dominate in this world!”</p> 
 <p>When the old man finished speaking, an even stronger windstorm raged around Blue Maple and the old man. It was furious!</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple could only sense the terrifying storm around him. The incisive cutting sounds made by the wind were piercing. Even though the old man was here to protect him, Blue Maple still felt the prickling pain as the wind struck him. However, the weird thing was that Blue Maple’s clothes didn’t seem to be affected at all.</p> 
 <p>After a brief moment, the windstorm slowly dissipated and only slight blowing sounds could be heard……</p> 
 <p>When everything returned to normal, Blue Maple opened his eyes once again. The scene in front of him left him completely stunned!</p> 
 <p>The trees and plants around them had been completely uprooted and disappeared. Only soil and rocks were left behind. As Blue Maple peered into the distance, he only saw sand and rocks, as well as a large depression in the ground.</p> 
 <p>However, this depression was very smooth. Even the rocks in this depression seemed to be cut in the same alignment and arranged neatly...</p>
