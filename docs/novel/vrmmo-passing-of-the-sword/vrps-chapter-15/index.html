 <p>When the rest of the players stopped moving, Blue Maple turned and said to Blue Snow, “Hey, idiot. If you didn’t receive the quest, stand to one side.” </p> 
 <p>“You…how…” Blue Snow still hadn’t recovered from her earlier shock.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, I told you to stand to one side. I don’t have the energy to protect you. This is my quest.” This had to be the longest string of sentences that Blue Maple had ever put together. He had no choice, Blue Snow had not regained her focus yet.</p> 
 <p>“Er…” Blue Snow replied with a simple word. After that, she walked further back, but was still in a daze. After a while, she stepped back and said to Blue Maple, “Be careful, then.”</p> 
 <p>“What?” Blue Snow’s words left Blue Maple skeptical. However, he immediately turned back and faced the rest of the players who wanted to snatch his dagger. When he turned around, he scared them so much that they all took a step back. They were afraid after witnessing what he had just done. The corpse of the dead player was still lying there on the ground. After a player died, the system would preserve his body for ten minutes before it disappeared.</p> 
 <p>It was a 300 damage attack! Blue Maple’s HP was only 200 or so when he was at Level 7. Even if a warrior was naturally talented, his HP wouldn’t be much higher than others in the initial stages, definitely not more than 300! Even with armor, there would only be a slight difference. Moreover, the players currently averaged Level 5 now. Their attributes were far weaker than his. Even if Blue Maple took it easy, they wouldn’t be able to handle his attack.</p> 
 <p>Furthermore, Blue Maple knew how to target weak points. Blue Maple hadn’t fought animals on many occasions, but he had fought humans countless times. When it came to humans, he was very familiar with how he should attack, defend, and avoid attacks. Killing was too easy for him!</p> 
 <p>“Please, this can’t be. 300 damage in one attack? Is this guy a player or a NPC? He’s too terrifying!”</p> 
 <p>“That’s right. I still thought he was a player earlier. Now that I look at it, he doesn’t even have a name or a level. He might actually be an NPC who’s here to offer a quest. Is the system trying to prank us?”</p> 
 <p>Just as everyone was in doubt, a wicked-sounding voice spoke up. Blue Maple immediately recognized the old man’s voice.</p> 
 <p>“Hehehe, guys, this fellow is just like the rest of you. It’s just that he’s stronger than any of you. The quest I gave to all of you is a team effort. It shouldn’t be a solo effort and none of you should be as idiotic as that guy who attacked before he understood what was going on.” The old man was motivating everyone else while he watched from one side.</p> 
 <p>The old man’s words quickly took effect.</p> 
 <p>“So it’s really a quest. Fuck, you should have said so earlier! Come, let’s attack together!”</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, all of you should go together. Either you attack him or attempt to snatch his dagger. When the reward has been secured, it’s time for all of you to pit your abilities against one another. Without killing him, you won’t get the reward. Anyway, you can’t level up without a good weapon. It’s better to just die once and fall a level.”</p> 
 <p>The old man’s words were indeed effective. With someone to inspire them, all the players were all the more eager to carry out the quest. Blue Maple remained where he was from start until end, waiting for everything to happen. Blue Maple knew that he just needed to kill a hundred people. As for anything else, it was inconsequential.</p> 
 <p>The players who had already formed teams were already discussing their strategy. Solo players were either looking for teammates or trying to get a grip on the situation.</p> 
 <p>Blue Snow had already recovered from her shock. She was angry as she looked at Blue Maple’s back. “Hmph, Little Gangster, you’re such a big idiot. I helped you out of goodwill, but you asked me to go to one side. What kind of person are you? Hmph! You even called me an idiot. I’m so pissed! But...don’t be killed by those baddies.” Blue Snow added on.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple’s attention wasn’t on Blue Snow, but he was still very cautious about any attacks from behind, so he still managed to hear her. However, he didn’t react, and continued standing where he was.</p> 
 <p>The old man was chuckling at one side, “This young lady seems rather interesting. That rascal even admitted it.”</p> 
 <p>A group of players were already inching closer to Blue Maple. There were six of them. <em>I wonder what the maximum number of players is. Will any solo players ambush me?</em></p> 
 <p>The heavy armored players were in front, followed by leather armored players. From their cautious approach, it seemed they were trying to snatch the dagger.</p> 
 <p>However, no matter what method they used, he was going to kill whoever came!</p> 
 <p>The first to charge over were two heavy armored players, while two other leather armored players followed closely behind. Two other light armor players waited for the opportune moment at one side. Magic-type players wore leather armor instead of cloth armor before they reached Level 10.</p> 
 <p>The formation the enemies used didn’t matter to Blue Maple long as his dagger wasn’t snatched and he wasn’t attacked. Blue Maple was very confident of his adaptability and reflexes.</p> 
 <p>“Grr!” “Ha!”</p> 
 <p>The two heavy armor players fired an attack at Blue Maple, who easily dodged the two attacks. He didn’t even need to block them, and even stabbed his sword at the player on the right.</p> 
 <p>He managed to stab his throat!</p> 
 <p><em>-298! </em></p> 
 <p>Instant kill!</p> 
 <p>He kicked the other player with his foot. His overwhelming strength sent the player flying. At the same time, the player incurred 98 damage. Blue Maple could have used his Cold Light Slash to kill him, but he didn’t plan on revealing that skill so soon. After all, he didn’t know who the old man would find. It was still important for him to keep a trump card.</p> 
 <p>The two lightly armored players were about to snatch the dagger as Blue Maple attacked. However, Blue Maple didn’t stop them. He could have instantly unleashed an attack, but he decided to follow them. After all, he couldn’t be too far from his dagger.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that Blue Maple had followed them, the one player attacked Blue Maple. After all, he didn’t need to hurt Blue Maple. Blue Maple was already prepared for this scenario. He lifted his sword and blocked the attack. At the same time, he could counterattack!</p> 
 <p>He didn’t kill the person who grabbed the dagger, but the other player. After all, all players moved with the same speed before they switched classes, no matter what Class they were in right now. However, Blue Maple was slightly faster than him, as Blue Maple’s shoes increased his mobility by three percent. Even though it wasn’t very much, at least it made him faster.</p> 
 <p>After killing the first one, the other player who was trying to snatch the dagger was under great psychological pressure. After all, the player who was killed was behind him. The two lightly armor players immediately came to offer reinforcements after watching another player die at the hands of Blue Maple. They both attacked Blue Maple.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple wasn’t worried at all. He easily dodged those two players’ attacks and continued to chase down the player who stole the dagger after kicking one of the light-armored players aside. He found it sufficient to maintain a distance from that player, as long as he could still attack that player. If anything happened, he could just use his Cold Light Slash to kill him!</p> 
 <p>The other players were equally slow. They couldn’t use weapons to attack. As for other physical skills like kicking, they weren’t good enough to rival Blue Maple. Kicks and punches could be easily blocked. Otherwise, Blue Maple would be done for if seven or eight people surrounded him and tried to beat him up.</p> 
 <p>The remaining light-armored player attempted to use his body to knock into Blue Maple. Blue Maple had predicted this and even hoped that the players would do this to him. As the remaining players had discussed how to deal with him, Blue Maple also thought of how to retaliate. One of his ideas involved a very interesting move.</p> 
 <p>When that light-armored player was about to knock into Blue Maple, Blue Maple suddenly spun the blade of his sword towards that player. After that, he performed an elegant spin move just as he chased down the leather armor player. His blade spun with him and slit the oncoming player’s throat. </p> 
 <p><em>-316!</em> Instant kill!</p> 
 <p>---</p> 
 <p>“Fuck, this rascal really knows how to play!” the old man cursed from the side. </p> 
 <p>At the same time, Blue Snow opened her eyes wide from where she was stuck in a daze and exclaimed, “You can do that!?”</p> 
 <p>As Blue Maple’s sword spun with him, whoever touched the blade of the sword would naturally be hurt. It wasn’t an ordinary attack!</p> 
 <p>---</p> 
 <p>After that, Blue Maple directly killed the player who had stolen the dagger. Everyone watching was completely astonished. In just a few attacks, the entire fight was settled!</p> 
 <p>The two players who were kicked away backed off. <em>Quest progress – 5%!</em></p> 
 <p>As for why Blue Maple wasn’t hurt at all from blocking the attacks, it was because his level and strength were much superior. If one party was completely superior, he wouldn’t be hurt while blocking attacks!</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple’s next action left everyone speechless. The old man started cursing. Blue Maple dragged the two corpses beside his dagger to it while no one was trying to attack him. Even though the system could preserve corpses, it only protected the corpses from any physical deformation, but not from non-physical humiliation.</p> 
 <p>This meant that whoever wanted to snatch the dagger now had to shift the corpses aside. If one was killed in the process of trying to move the corpses aside, it would only increase the difficulty for those behind. Blue Maple was very proud of his idea. Those who discovered Blue Maple’s intention weren’t able to stop him in time. However, Blue Maple actually crawled on the ground to pull the corpses close to the dagger because he wanted to remain close to his dagger. Of course, this was only done after he was certain that no one was attacking him.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, rascal, move the corpses aside! That is cheating! You are flouting the rules!” the old man’s voice sounded out. If the old man wasn’t being careful to avoid any intervention in this quest, he would have shifted the corpses to the side by himself!</p> 
 <p>“You didn’t specify that I couldn’t do it!” Blue Maple retorted. Even though there wasn’t any other expression on his face, it still felt like he was being a little shameless.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, old baddie didn’t mention that.” Blue Snow also chipped in with her opinion at this moment. Her tone was a little excited and cheeky.</p> 
 <p>“Fuck off! Of course I didn’t tell you. I’m not a baddie. You have to respect your elders!” The old man was displeased with Blue Snow’s comment. Of course, that was also because he had indeed not specified such a rule.</p> 
 <p>“If you aren’t a baddie, you wouldn’t have asked people to snatch his things!” Blue Snow rebutted in displeasure.</p> 
 <p>“It’s called training! Training. I, I’m…so pissed!” The old man’s voice was a little over the top now.</p> 
 <p>Blue Maple continued to look at Blue Snow skeptically. He didn’t know what she was trying to achieve.</p> 
 <p>Blue Snow also realized that Blue Maple was looking at her. “What are you looking at? I just feel that the old baddie has annoyed me. Don’t overthink it!” Blue Snow blurted out as her face.</p> 
 <p><em>She’s actually pretty interesting…</em>, immediately surfaced in Blue Maple’s mind. <em>However, she’s an idiot… an interesting idiot.</em></p> 
 <p>After that, Blue Maple quietly stood there and waited for the other players to attack him.</p> 
 <p>Although Blue Maple did scare off the players, they were still very motivated by their intrinsic greed. In addition, they were all very jealous of Blue Maple. Why was the difference between him and the rest so huge, even though they joined the game at the same time? This left many jealous.</p> 
 <p>Even though the players were probably strangers, they all shared the same sentiments. Even though there were going to be problems regarding the allocation of the final reward from killing Blue Maple, the problems could still be resolved through contractual agreements in the game. The teams that were formed by the players were probably only possible because of those contractual agreements.</p> 
 <p>A team worked together to complete a goal. If the rewards were given after a player was killed during a quest, they would only be allocated after that player was revived. In the meantime, the system was responsible for keeping their rewards.</p> 
 <p>As a result, Blue Maple’s next group of enemies was already drawing closer and closer to him. There were seven of them! At the same time, there were a few players waiting for their opportunity at the sides. As for whether they were working in tandem with one another, it was a mystery.</p> 
 <p>However, this didn’t make any difference to Blue Maple. He was going to kill anyone who came!</p>
