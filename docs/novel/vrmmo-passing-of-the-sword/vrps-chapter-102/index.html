 <p>Both of them had managed to press their dagger into each other’s neck. However, they’d also both stopped simultaneously, refusing to push their daggers in further.</p>
 <p>A trickle of blood was present on both of their necks. However, as the fresh blood streamed down their necks, both of them didn’t seem to notice.</p>
 <p>After this, they retrieved their daggers from each other’s neck at the same time. They then took a step forward before turning to face each other.</p>
 <p>Their surroundings were quiet. Even birds couldn’t be heard chirping. A pin drop would be audible right now.</p>
 <p>The dagger formed from Blue Maple’s Heavenly Fire had already disappeared from his left hand. Only his simple dagger was left in his right hand. Whereas the icy-cold lady’s hands were drooping by her side as she clenched onto her daggers. It didn’t seem as if both of them had just engaged in an intense fight.</p>
 <p>However, the blood that streamed down the back of their necks was proof of their fight…</p>
 <p>They finally spoke after some time. It was their first conversation.</p>
 <p>“Blue Maple.”</p>
 <p>“Mystery.”</p>
 <p>They simply reported their names, but Blue Maple was the first to speak. However, Mystery didn’t lag too far behind. She was ready too, but Blue Maple was ever so slightly quicker.</p>
 <p>Mystery’s voice was just like her name – cold and mysterious.</p>
 <p>No, to be exact, her entire person gave off such a feeling.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple’s voice was indifferent.</p>
 <p>“You’re strong.” Mystery still sounded as cold as ever.</p>
 <p>“Where do you come from?” Blue Maple didn’t answer her question. Instead, he posed his own doubts.</p>
 <p>“You can roughly guess.” Mystery hesitated a little. However, her facial expression didn’t change at all.</p>
 <p>“Is that so? You’re also very strong.” Blue Maple paused for a moment, as if he was thinking of something. Just like Mystery, his expression didn’t change at all.</p>
 <p>Both of them were really similar.</p>
 <p>Silence descended once again……</p>
 <p>Blue Maple broke the silence.</p>
 <p>“Your class should be ordinary, right?” Blue Maple asked all of a sudden.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Mystery’s reply was concise.</p>
 <p>“Here.” After Blue Maple finished speaking, he spun his dagger in his right hand before pinching the tip of the dagger. Then, he passed it to Mystery.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple passed his seemingly-ordinary dagger to her.</p>
 <p>Mystery was doubtful as she glanced at the dagger. Then, she looked at Blue Maple. She didn’t know what he meant by that.</p>
 <p>Both of them were less than three steps from each other. Mystery could take Blue Maple’s dagger if she slightly leaned forward.</p>
 <p>However, Mystery was hesitating.</p>
 <p>“Inheritance?” Mystery seemed to have thought of something. She uncertainly mentioned and slightly twisted her head. Her coldness seemed to add to her beauty.</p>
 <p>“It suits you.” Blue Maple immediately admitted. He also clearly stated his intention.</p>
 <p>Old Man Fang had secretly stuffed the dagger into Blue Maple’s bag after he completed his second class advancement. He instructed Blue Maple to pass the dagger to a suitable Thief if he saw one and to help initiate the inheritance.</p>
 <p>Originally, Blue Maple wanted to give it to Crippled Feather, but he felt that Crippled Feather wasn’t strong enough yet, which was why he hadn’t given it to him yet. There was also his ridiculous conversation with Four Stones back then.</p>
 <p>Right now, he wanted to give it to Mystery.</p>
 <p>He believed that Mystery was strong enough and the dagger suited her.</p>
 <p>The inheritance was a…</p>
 <p>Rank SS class – Looming Shadow!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Mystery stared at Blue Maple with her icy-cold gaze and didn’t accept the dagger immediately.</p>
 <p>Confusion, curiosity, coldness……all these were revealed from her clear, beautiful eyes. Blue Maple didn’t look away and continued to calmly stare back.</p>
 <p>From the moment he took out the dagger to fight her, he was ready to give it to her. He did it very naturally too.</p>
 <p>“Is it very suitable?” Mystery muttered something before turning her attention away from Blue Maple and to the dagger.</p>
 <p>Then, she grabbed onto it……</p>
 <p>“Boom!!!”</p>
 <p>Just as she grabbed the dagger, a terrifying aura was unleashed from the dagger. After this, terrifying blue flames engulfed both of them.</p>
 <p>All the trees within a several hundred meters square radius were torched by the spreading blue fire.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t Blue Maple’s Heavenly Fire, but……Old Man Fang’s fusion of Heavenly and Earthly Fire!</p>
 <p>Not only did the fire contain the strength of Old Man Fang’s fire, it also contained a terrifying wave of energy. It was an energy that Blue Maple had never felt before!</p>
 <p>This sudden burst of energy didn’t harm Blue Maple or Mystery. Instead, it traversed across their bodies delicately. The ferocious heatwave shook their hairs and clothes, but both of them continued to hold onto the dagger. The undulations that spread didn’t affect them at all.</p>
 <p>One was holding onto the sword tip while the other was holding onto the sword hilt……</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the terrifying energy that had erupted began to revolve above both of them, creating an energy vortex. Both of them were in the center of this vortex!</p>
 <p>The energy from the vortex destroyed everything that was sucked into it. It didn’t matter if it was a branch, sand, or rocks…..</p>
 <p>Everything turned to nothing.</p>
 <p>The terrifying blue flames were burning within the vortex. Along with the energy from the vortex, the fire distorted space. Spatial cracks that resembled lightning bolts littered the vortex!</p>
 <p>However, those spatial cracks didn’t affect the vortex at all. It was as if they came together……</p>
 <p>“Fuck…what, what’s that?!” Players from afar bore witness to this frightening scene. They weren’t able to venture deeper into the forest, but they were still able to clearly see the vortex from afar.</p>
 <p>This was many more times more awe-inspiring than Subtle Nobleman’s inheritance initiation!</p>
 <p>“Is it another inheritance? How can it possibly be so impressive?!” The players from afar were completely astonished by what they saw.</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me……the Demons have descended much earlier than expected……” Someone whose voice was trembling muttered amongst the players.</p>
 <p>“Fuck, that’s possible!”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. There was already one terrifying inheritance this morning. How could another scary one appear again so soon?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. If it’s the Demons, perhaps it’s a sudden quest in the game. Perhaps we can gain something from it?”</p>
 <p>“You’re right. Quick, let’s go take a look!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The vortex attracted all the players over. Some of them even called their good friends as well. Very soon, the forest was about to be filled with players.</p>
 <p>The vortex was still spinning, and there were still two people in the middle of it. They were holding onto the same dagger, and allowed the terrifying heatwaves to rage all around them.</p>
 <p>They maintained their posture and kept staring at each other. They were quietly waiting for the vortex to disappear.</p>
 <p>If it still didn’t disappear soon, Blue Maple was going to let go of his hand.</p>
 <p>Mystery had the same thought as him……</p>
 <p>After a while, the vortex didn’t seem like it was going to slow down. It continued to spin and destroy everything that entered it. Many trees and rocks had already been completely destroyed by the vortex.</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, any player that got close would also be sucked in.</p>
 <p>“We can’t wait anymore.”</p>
 <p>Just as Blue Maple thought to himself, there was a slight change in the look in his eyes as he stared at Mystery.</p>
 <p>Mystery had the same look in her eyes.</p>
 <p>Then, both of them seemed to have reached an agreement as they looked at each other. They immediately let go of their hands……</p>
 <p>“Om!”</p>
 <p>Just as they let go of their hands, a strong wave of energy spread from the dagger. It was like a ripple, and spread towards the vortex.</p>
 <p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p>
 <p>Booms started to reverberate from the vortex. After this, it picked up speed, but it was clearly shrinking. It was shrinking towards the dagger.</p>
 <p>The vortex was spinning quicker and quicker, and was shrinking as quickly. The dagger silently drifted in front of Blue Maple and Mystery. After this, the tip pointed straight downward. Both of them also silently stood by the side of the sword and allowed the heatwaves to rage on. They were very calm even in this situation.</p>
 <p>“Boom boom boom……”</p>
 <p>The vortex spun and shrank quicker and quicker……</p>
 <p>Eventually, it shrank until only both of them could be accommodated inside it before turning into a huge, blackish-blue fireball. This fireball engulfed both of them. There were no longer any trees or withered leaves around them. Only an empty patch of ground was left behind……</p>
 <p>Finally, the fireball shrunk drastically, and then began to spin abnormally fast!</p>
 <p>Then…it seemed to have been devoured by space as it slowly turned into a small dot and vanished…</p>
 <p>The dagger vanished. At the same time, Blue Maple and Mystery had both also disappeared.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>In a different place much further away…</p>
 <p>“Has that cursed old man’s inheritance been initiated? I didn’t expect both of them to be the first.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Hmph, first it’s that damned old man flaunting his disciple. Now it’s an initiation of another inheritance. Are all of these premeditated?”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Seems like I need to be quicker too. I wonder why they’re so fortunate. How did they manage to find an inheritor so quickly?”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Oh, those old fellows might be wrong. It’s closer to here. It seems like…it’s that cursed old man’s disciple who managed to find another disciple of his… Damn, the energy interference is simply too strong. I can’t sense anything clearly…”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“From the looks of it, things are getting interesting…”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The voice of a Rank SSS inheritance mentor was present. There were both male and female voices. Some were old, while some were full of energy…</p>
 <p>Indeed, everything in this gaming world was just a start.</p>
 <p>The game still had a very long way to go…</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Right now, in an unknown cave, the space in the cave was abnormally wide. It was as if there was an entire world inside.</p>
 <p>The cave was very dim. There weren’t many light sources in the cave, but one could still make out several strange rocks in this cave. In the dark, these rocks seemed scary and fierce.</p>
 <p>The ground was still very level, but it was slick from the water puddles scattered across the ground. An eerie and humid aura filled the entire cave.</p>
 <p>Blue Maple and Mystery had been teleported into this cave, still in their previous positions. They both seemed quite peaceful in such an environment.</p>
