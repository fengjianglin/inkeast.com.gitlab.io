 <p><b>Chapter 122: Fried chicken</b></p>
 <p>I froze and stopped to look up and down. But aside from me, there weren’t anyone else. The whole staircase was empty. The atmosphere was very creepy.</p>
 <p><i>Could it be a ghost? But ghosts can’t speak?! </i></p>
 <p>Perhaps I haven’t spoken for far too long, the lights from the staircase suddenly turned off and scared me out of my mind.</p>
 <p>“Ahhhh!!!!” I yelled. The lights turned back on. But it was definitely much dimmer than before. On the inside, I was very nervous because I was truly afraid that there was someone or something following me.</p>
 <p><i>Am I hallucinating?</i> The voice never appeared again. My heart began to calm down and I thought to myself,</p>
 <p><i>I only have to get on the first floor. It’ll be ok once I get to the first floor. </i></p>
 <p>So, I began to focus on my task again. While I was three steps away from landing, it was as if someone suddenly shoved me from the back. I fell from the stairs and painfully landed on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Ahhh!” I screamed into the walkie-talkie and directly fell down the stairs. My painful cry echoed all around me. It felt very eerie.</p>
 <p>“What the heck?!....” I went to check my injury. There was a throbbing pain on my wrist. I must have sprained it.</p>
 <p>Since Suyang couldn’t locate me, he would eventually come find me. So, I sat at the lowest step as I waited for him.</p>
 <p>As expected, in less than three minutes, I could hear Suyang huffing and puffing up the stairs.</p>
 <p>“I’m here!” I tapped on the handrail and yelled down below.</p>
 <p>By the time Suyang reached my floor, he was already out of breath. He collapsed like a mess in front of me. “I f-finally found you….! You never replied back to my message. I thought something happened to you!” He panted.</p>
 <p>I pointed at my hand, “Something did happen to me. My wrist is injured.”</p>
 <p>“How?”</p>
 <p>“I fell and twisted it.”</p>
 <p>“How could you be so careless?” Suyang had his eyes closed as he raised one hand to indicate that he needed a moment to catch his breath.</p>
 <p>A few minutes later, he crouched down and said, “Alright, climb up!”</p>
 <p>“My wrist is injured, not my ankle. Why?”</p>
 <p>“So you don’t want to?”</p>
 <p>“Well, since you offered…” I tried my best to straighten my arm. But I could barely touch his shoulder. “No, I need you to help me up. I can’t get on your back while sitting down.”</p>
 <p>Suyang helped me up and I leaned against the handrail before I was able to leap onto his back. While Suyang carried me, I placed my chin on his shoulder and gave him a sideways glance. He was sweating profusely.</p>
 <p>“Are you stupid? Why didn’t you take the elevator?”</p>
 <p>Suyang gave me a bitter smile and refuted, “You’re the one who’s stupid for asking that question. How would I have known which floor you were on? Obviously I had to check every single one!”</p>
 <p>“Oh yeah. I forgot. Which floor are we on now?”</p>
 <p>“21st.”</p>
 <p>“What? After so long, I’ve only gotten down 9 floors?” I found the truth very unacceptable. But knowing that Suyang had ran straight up to find me was very touching.</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, I tightened my grip around his neck. I wanted to hold him closer.</p>
 <p>“Goldfish…..” Suyang sounded like he was suffocating, “At this rate, I’m going to pass out.”</p>
 <p><i>Ugh! He’s always ruining the mood!</i></p>
 <p>After 20 floors later, Suyang and I had an argument. He said we had to return back to the apartment to wrap my wrist and rest. But I wanted my free meal. I said he promised. So we were in the front of the elevators for a very long time.</p>
 <p>Suyang pressed the floor of our apartment. But I pressed the 1st floor. Ultimately, Suyang pressed 27th floor and pushed me all the way into a corner where I wouldn’t be able to touch the elevator buttons.</p>
 <p>“Ah! Let me go! Suyang! I want to go for dinner! I’m hungry!” I didn’t care that my wrist was killing me as I began to smack his back; whining.</p>
 <p>“Be good. We can always go out to eat another time. But we must take care of the injury now. Or else, you will suffer from repercussions.”</p>
 <p>“No! I’m fine! Look!” I climbed on Suyang’s back and flung my uninjured wrist in front of him. “Let’s go eat, ok?” I tried to look pitiful.</p>
 <p>“The other hand!”</p>
 <p><i>Darn it</i>…</p>
 <p>“How about I go buy whatever you want to eat after I wrap your injury? Ok?”</p>
 <p>I shook my head, “It’s different if you bring it back. I want to eat in a restaurant. I want it hot and steamy!”</p>
 <p>“No, today, you’re not allowed to go out.” Suyang put me down and was about to open the door.</p>
 <p><i>Humph! Fine, you can stay home and eat by yourself. </i>For some strange reason, I was extremely stubborn about eating out today.</p>
 <p>“Get back here, you!” Suyang grabbed onto me. Sigh. I thought he was going to give in. But Suyang ended up placing me over his shoulders and dumping me inside the apartment.</p>
 <p>I knew I wouldn’t be able to get my way today. So, I laid on the couch in a 大 shape and howled, “Hungry…!”</p>
 <p>“Tell me what you want. I’ll order takeout.”</p>
 <p>“I want to eat pig trotters, fried chicken, pizza, hamburger, roast duck, marinated beef, hotpot, bbq….” I named everything I liked.</p>
 <p>“Stop stop stop!” Suyang cut me off, “You may only choose one.”</p>
 <p>“Then, I pick fried chicken! I want fried chicken!”</p>
 <p>“So that’s how you gained so much weight….” Suyang quietly muttered. Then, he took out his phone from his pocket and called for fried chicken takeout.</p>
 <p><i>Fine! I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that comment!</i></p>
 <p>“Suyang, my wrist hurts a lot….” I showed him my wrist and pretended to act weak and delicate.</p>
 <p>Suyang calmly looked at me. “I thought you said it didn’t hurt earlier? Your body is quite unique.”</p>
 <p><i>Fine! I’ll hold it in! Just you wait! You’re going to fall into my trap!</i></p>
 <p>“Didn’t you say you will help me wrap my wrist?” I tried my best to speak as lightly as possible. The goal was to completely catch Suyang off guard. <i>Then I will… muahaha!</i></p>
 <p><i>I will give him a fatal blow! How dare he called me fat! </i></p>
 <p>“You’re too careless. How could you always be so clumsy?” Suyang nagged me like a granny as he took out the medical box and inspected my wrist, “Look at this. It’s all red.”</p>
 <p>While Suyang wasn’t paying attention, I unbuttoned the first two buttons of my blouse. I wanted to use this opportunity to tease him a bit.</p>
 <p><i>That’s what he gets for not taking me out to dinner</i>…</p>
 <p>I gazed at Suyang’s face and waited for his reaction.</p>
 <p><i>Huh? No reaction? Could it be that it wasn’t obvious enough? </i></p>
 <p>While Suyang wasn’t looking, I unbuttoned another button. This time, I deliberately brushed against his hand.</p>
 <p><i>Still no reaction? This man is too focused! How come he can’t multitask?! Now I feel like I have no charm… ugh. So sad. </i></p>
 <p>Just as I was about to unbutton the 4th button, Suyang commented, “Stop unbuttoning your buttons. At this rate, I can see your bra.” The whole time, he was massaging my wrist.</p>
 <p>My hand stopped in mid air and I awkwardly looked at Suyang. <i>So he noticed</i>…</p>
 <p>“Calling you stupid is being nice….” Suyang shook his head. However, he had a crafty smile on his face. “It’s just me and you here. Are you sure you want to seduce me?”</p>
 <p><i>Oh! My! God! </i></p>
 <p><i>I was fooled by his innocent face! Although Suyang looked like a pure boy, I almost forgot he was a kissing maniac. &nbsp;</i></p>
 <p>Thinking of this, I quickly pulled my hands away and buttoned up my blouse.</p>
 <p>“Well, right now, you’re injured. I’m usually not the type that would take advantage of the weak. But since you’re so willing today…..” Suyang shifted his body and gradually moved closer towards me.</p>
 <p>“What are you talking about? I don’t understand!” I used one hand to stop Suyang from getting any closer as I began to shift backwards.</p>
 <p>“Lin Yixin, would you like to be my woman?” Suyang seductively asked. His face was flushed as he gazed at me.</p>
 <p><i>He was putting me on the spot. Regardless of my response, it was to his advantage. </i></p>
 <p>“Aren’t we already boyfriend and girlfriend?” I pretended to be naive and avoided the question.</p>
 <p><i>How come Suyang was suddenly so brave? It wasn’t like him. </i></p>
 <p>“Today, you’re the one who tried to seduce me first.” Suyang whispered into my ears. My soul practically flew out.</p>
 <p>*Ding dong* <i>Whew. The takeout person saved me.</i></p>
 <p>Suyang sighed and got up. I could hear him mumbling resentfully, “How are the takeouts so fast these days?”</p>
 <p>Suyang looked very unwilling as he went to get the door. But then, I saw his body froze. Based on my womanly instinct, something bad was about to happen.</p>
