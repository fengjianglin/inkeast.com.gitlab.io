 <p><b>Chapter 82: Suyang’s confession</b></p>
 <p><i>I didn’t realize I had already gotten to this stage. But as the bullet was coming out, my brain didn’t even think. My body reacted first. I naturally blocked it for him. </i></p>
 <p><i>When did I become so nimble? </i></p>
 <p><i>But I don’t regret it. </i></p>
 <p><i>Finally, I’ve done something I wouldn’t regret….</i></p>
 <p>By the time I felt the intense pain on my chest, I had already fallen into Suyang’s arms. Everything appeared more and more hazy. I couldn’t tell if it were my tears or I was losing consciousness.</p>
 <p>“Lin Yixin! Lin Yixin! Remain alert! Don’t sleep!”</p>
 <p>It had been a long time since I heard Suyang use my real name. He normally called me “Goldfish”. Now that he was acting like this, it made me feel the severity of the situation.</p>
 <p>I have been shot.</p>
 <p>“Don’t use my name… it sounds too serious….” I managed to squeeze out those words as I raised my hand to touch Suyang’s face. I felt something wet.</p>
 <p><i>He was crying? </i></p>
 <p><i>Why's he crying?</i></p>
 <p><i>Don’t cry….you….</i></p>
 <p>This was the first time I’ve seen Suyang’s tears. It was more painful watching him cry than crying myself. Or perhaps, it was because of the pain I felt from the gunshot.</p>
 <p>I finally came to the realization that I didn’t simply like him. I love him. Gradually, I began to lose consciousness.</p>
 <p>“You’ll be fine! I won’t let anything happen to you!” Suyang screamed into my ears. But it sounded so distant and far away.</p>
 <p><i>Silly, I’m the one who wouldn’t let anything happen to you…. </i></p>
 <p>Before I completely lost consciousness, I secretly made a vow to Suyang - I must stay alive for his sake!</p>
 <p>----</p>
 <p>The gunshot wound was two centimeters from my heart. Because of those two centimeters, I lived.</p>
 <p>I was sitting on a chair in my ward as I watched my unconscious self on the hospital bed and snickered.</p>
 <p><i>I am experiencing the out-of-body experience….!</i></p>
 <p><i>Yes! I’ve become a spirit!</i> Although my body still showed vital signs, my consciousness had floated out. I was in the same state as Sheyu once was.</p>
 <p>Regardless of how loudly I yelled, no one could hear me.<i> Ai…..is this what ghosts normally experience? How boring</i>…</p>
 <p>Suyang had already been by 'my' side for the entire day and night. He had never left. Since his back was facing me, I couldn’t see his facial expressions.</p>
 <p>Suyang’s proud waist was now curved like dazed wanderer. <i>Was he feeling guilty? </i></p>
 <p>The more Suyang was like this, the more my heart ached for him.</p>
 <p>This incident occurred because of my failure to think thoroughly. Obviously, I wouldn’t have let Suyang taken the bullet…</p>
 <p>I wanted to comfort him and hug him. I wanted to lightly pat his back and tell him it was fine. <i>I’ve been by your side all this time. </i></p>
 <p>Yet, I couldn’t do something so simple.</p>
 <p>I approached Suyang as I crouched by his side. I admired him and rested my chin on my hands. Since he wasn’t aware of my existence, I could admire him from any direction.</p>
 <p>Suyang was no longer in a violent rage. Currently, he had reverted back to his calm self. But his pupils appeared to have lost a layer of some sort. It seemed so dim.</p>
 <p>“Lin Yixin….” Suyang began.</p>
 <p>“Huh?” I was spooked and fell onto the ground. I thought Suyang could see me. I didn’t blink at all as I waited for him to continue.</p>
 <p>“While you’re asleep, I will say this once. Regardless of whether you could hear it or not, I’m only going to say this once.”</p>
 <p>“Uh…” <i>So he can’t see me after all….</i></p>
 <p><i>Go and say whatever you want! I am listening!</i> I replied next to him. Except Suyang couldn’t hear anything.</p>
 <p>“I like you.” Suyang’s voice turned abnormally gentle. It was as if his voice had turned into a feather that was floating softly down into my lake.Then, *di*, there was a ripple.</p>
 <p>I remained frozen at my spot. I was at a loss for words. <i>Why's he suddenly confessing? Wait wait! Why's he doing it while I am unconscious? That’s messed up. Is he only saying this because I am unconscious? He should be telling me this when I’m conscious and awake! </i></p>
 <p>Right now, I desperately wanted to grab onto Suyang’s collar and shake him. “Why don’t you tell me this when I’m awake, huh? This is such a serious issue!!!!”</p>
 <p>“Including your part, I’m going to get it all back from the Chairman’s family.”</p>
 <p>*Falls apart* <i>Who the hell cares about the Chairman’s family at this time?! </i>I rolled my eyes.</p>
 <p><i>The most important point is that Suyang had confessed to me!?! </i></p>
 <p><i>He said he likes me, right?! I haven’t misheard?!</i></p>
 <p><i>Could I be hallucinating ever since I’ve become a spirit?! Or maybe I was in an alternate universe?! Does a different Lin Yixin and Suyang exist in another world? </i></p>
 <p>I wanted to hear him say it again…</p>
 <p>While I was praying to the Heavens, Suyang got up and gradually minimized the distance between us. Our lips were getting closer and closer…</p>
 <p><i>He wants to kiss me? Not now! Hello!?!? I’m over here! I’m over here!!! </i></p>
 <p>I anxiously tried to seize Suyang’s thigh, but I only managed to grab onto air.</p>
 <p>“Noooo! Noooo! Noooo!!” I screeched.</p>
 <p><i>At least do it when I could feel it!?!</i>.... I wanted to cry but had no tears. I was so frustrated that I began to roll across the floor.</p>
 <p><i>Under these circumstances, there's no difference between kissing or not kissing!</i></p>
 <p>But fighting was useless. I blatantly glared as Suyang gave me a light kiss on the lips.</p>
 <p><i>My first kiss</i>…. I covered my face.</p>
 <p><i>I had my first kiss without actually experiencing it. What a waste. </i></p>
 <p><i>On a brighter note, Suyang actually likes me? Damn… I had no idea! He hid it so well! Yet, I still caught him! Muahahaha. </i></p>
 <p>Thinking of this, I cunningly smiled at Suyang.</p>
 <p>He was gazing at 'me' very lovingly.</p>
 <p>“Am I interrupting you guys?” Following the sounds of the high heels, Mi Fan appeared. I was quite surprised to see her. I stood up and floated to her side.</p>
 <p>“I was wondering when you would come.” Suyang slowly got up. He was different from his usual polite self. His voice was very cold and the atmosphere changed drastically.</p>
 <p>“Do you really need to be so guarded towards me? I didn’t have anything to do with what happened to her.” Mi Fan calmly replied. Then, she stepped forward. “This is the information you want.”</p>
 <p>Suyang didn’t take the stash of paper from Mi Fan. He coldly replied, “You have prepared it all along? Then why are you giving it to me now?”</p>
