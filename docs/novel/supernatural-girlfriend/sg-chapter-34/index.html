 <p><b>Chapter 34: Make me feel something</b></p>
 <p>I heard him, but I didn’t respond as I looked the other way. Just like the scenery that was flashing by outside, many thoughts were running through my mind. My mind was an utter mess.</p>
 <p>As Suyang mentioned, we have so many different relationships between us. But I was afraid that one day, if one of the relationship breaks, all the other ones will naturally fall apart as well.</p>
 <p>Some time later, I ended up falling asleep without knowing. By the time I woke up, the car was already parked in the parking lot downstairs. Apparently, I had fallen asleep against the car door. In addition, I was drooling too.</p>
 <p>I could still sense Suyang on the driver’s seat. I didn’t want him to notice that I was drooling, so I didn’t dare to raise my head as I secretly used the lower hem of my jacket to wipe the corner of my mouth to get rid of all noticeable traces. I pretended I had just woken up.</p>
 <p>The moment I lifted my head, Xu Weishan had plastered herself against the car door.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” I covered my eyes with both my hands and deeply buried my head. I was so frightened by Xu Weishan that my heart was furiously pounding.</p>
 <p>One second, two seconds, three seconds…</p>
 <p>Just as I was about to recover from fright, Suyang grabbed my hand and smoothly pulled me into his embrace. My mind was starting to turn woozy again.&nbsp;<em>Was Suyang hugging me right now?</em></p>
 <p>I didn’t know where to put my hands. So currently, my fists were clenched in the air. My entire body was stiff.</p>
 <p>Suyang patted my back and soothingly comforted me in a soft voice, “Did you have a nightmare? Don’t be afraid….”</p>
 <p>“I….I’m fine. Let’s go home.” I wanted to get up, but Suyang's hand suppressed me from moving.</p>
 <p>“Why are you always like this? You were like this the first time we met. You were also like this at the hotel…. honestly, why?”</p>
 <p>“I -I had a nightmare.”</p>
 <p>“A nightmare? You had a nightmare while you were conscious?” Suyang didn’t believe me.</p>
 <p>I nodded, “I’m usually the type that freaks out if the wind blows and the grass moves. Sorry if my reactions scared you. I didn’t mean to…”</p>
 <p>“It’s fine. Instead of scaring me, I thought you were purposely using your stupid goldfish methods to try and take advantage of me.”</p>
 <p>I lifted my head and made eye contact with Suyang’s slightly raised eyes. I was so serious, yet he was deviating into an inappropriate path. The only way to deal with an inappropriate individual was to be more inappropriate than the individual.</p>
 <p>“I think you’re the one who wants to take advantage of me?! If you continue hugging me like this, I cannot guarantee nothing will happen….after all, you’re so handsome. I’m not the one at a loss!”</p>
 <p>Sure enough, my words were effective. Suyang immediately released me and opened the car door as he backed up.</p>
 <p>I knew it was going to work. Last time I was changing, Suyang had made a big fuss out of nothing. At the end of the day, all he had was a powerful mouth. I sighed a breath of relief. Now that Suyang wasn’t saying anything else, I didn’t have to keep acting. I quietly followed him home.</p>
 <p>Suyang had no idea, but there were actually three of us on the same path the entire time. I kept glaring at Xu Weishan, who was next to me. When Suyang walked further ahead, I threatened her underneath my breath, “If you dare to scare me again, I am not going to help you!”</p>
 <p>Originally, I thought my threat would be sufficient. However, Xu Weishan gave me a blank expression. Then, she pointed her right finger at Suyang, left at me, and combined them together.</p>
 <p>“It’s not what you’re thinking!” Seeing how Xu Weishan had misunderstood, I immediately wanted to clarify, “There is nothing going on between us!”</p>
 <p><i>Don’t tell me she thought she was helping me by scaring me…</i></p>
 <p>“Why aren’t you walking? Why are your hands dancing and feet tripping?” Suyang asked as he stood in front of the passageway.</p>
 <p>“Ai! Coming!” I fully ran towards Suyang. When I was next to him, he insulted my short legs and so on. I cast a glance at Xu Weishan and made a long face to prove that someone like Suyang and I would never have that type of relationship.</p>
 <p>Suyang seemed to have forgotten to interrogate me about Grandmother Meng. If he wasn't going to mention it, I naturally wouldn't bring it up. After entering the apartment, I ran straight to my room. I pulled the curtains up but didn’t see the mistress by the window. Then, I fell asleep on the bed.</p>
 <p>“Can you wash your face and rinse your mouth before you sleep?” Suyang stood by the door and asked in a disapproving manner.</p>
 <p>“No….”</p>
 <p><i>Was it a misconception? Ever since I was at Grandmother Meng’s, I felt an exhaustion that wouldn’t go away. Could it be because the Su descendants had taken turns extracting all of my energy? </i></p>
 <p><i>Who can understand the pain of those in the lowest rung? </i></p>
 <p>-----</p>
 <p>I stared at the fake Xu Weishan the entire class. I couldn’t imagined how thick of a skin she must have in order to murder her sister and replace her in such a carefree manner.</p>
 <p>“Bai Silu! Bai Silu!” The person next to me nudged my arm and brought my wandering mind back to reality.</p>
 <p>Since I was so focused, I was a bit agitated that she had ruined my train of thought. So, I gave her a big sister attitude and snapped, “What?”</p>
 <p>“The professor just called your name…” The girl’s expression appeared a bit cowardly due to my reaction. She looked wronged.</p>
 <p>I was still very unfamiliar with the name “Bai Silu”. I often failed to react to it.</p>
 <p>“If you’re not going to pay attention in my class, then I’d rather you leave. I am talking to the student sitting at the very end; Bai Silu classmate. Please take note.” Suyang coldly stated.</p>
 <p>Then, Suyang continued his lessons. But there were a few times that his eyes had swept by me. I could tell he was angry…</p>
 <p>From what I could remember, I didn’t choose a course called “history of literature”. However, when I received my timetable, the three words “history of literature” had blatantly appeared on my schedule for every Wednesday afternoon.</p>
 <p>This was the shadow of my life.</p>
 <p>“Bai Silu, answer my question.” Suyang called my name again.</p>
 <p>“What…..?” I shook my head. The whole class had their attention on me. <i>What did Suyang say? I zoned out again? </i></p>
 <p><i>Were University professors supposed to ask the students so many questions?</i> The way Suyang was acting reminded me of my High School home-form teacher. Each time I was caught for not paying attention, he would punish me by making me run around the track.</p>
 <p>I wasn’t used to having so many eyes on me. Why did he have to purposely make me look bad in front of so many people? Deep down, I resented Suyang.</p>
 <p>The fake Xu Weishan also turned around to look at me. She had a “I know the answer” expression on her face. It really annoyed me.</p>
 <p>“Uh…..” Before I could say another word, the bell rung.</p>
 <p><i>Yes! Saved by the bell!</i> I secretly rejoiced. But I accidentally made eye contact with Suyang. I quickly lowered my head and mumbled to myself, “I’m invisible. Invisible. He cannot see me. He cannot see me.”</p>
 <p>Sadly, he didn’t have the intentions of letting me go. He spoke in a stern tone, “Bai Silu, follow me.”</p>
 <p>Since Suyang was a guest professor, the University had given him an office. I guess it was somewhat believable if he was actually a famous author. I entered the office sulkily. I purposely left the door open so that his lecturing words would be less cruel; since many students or professors may happen to overhear.</p>
 <p>Suyang icily stated, “Close the door.” All my hopes were shattered. I respectfully shut the door and placed my hands politely on top of each other. “Boss… I can call you that now, right?”</p>
 <p>Suyang slammed a textbook on the table as he hollered, “You didn’t reach my requirements!”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t forget the reason why I sent you here. I didn’t send you here for you to daydream in class. We need to get into our roles. I’m the teacher and you’re the student. But. You. Totally. Failed.”</p>
 <p>Each of Suyang’s words jabbed my brain. I was truly speechless.</p>
 <p>“Then, please be more clear, boss? Be more specific?! You didn’t have specific requirements, so I acted the way I would’ve. This was how I behaved during my University years.”</p>
 <p>Suyang shook his head, “I told you. I want to gain some insight in regards to a teacher and student relationship. Can you make me feel something?”</p>
 <p><i>Forcing a person from society to return back to school was already ridiculous enough. What? Now I have to make you feel something?</i></p>
 <p>“Then tell me what type of girls make you ‘feel something’? I will work hard towards that direction.” On the surface, I spoke in an amicable manner. I gave off the tone that I knew I was wrong.</p>
 <p>Suyang seized my hand and locked me in between him and his office table.</p>
