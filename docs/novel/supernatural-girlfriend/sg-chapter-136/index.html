 <p><b>Chapter 136: The second time is still so beautiful</b></p>
 <p><span style>Suyang opened his mouth and grinned. “I do remember… you fainted that time! Thinking back, be honest ...were you secretly crushing on me all along and fainted because you were too overly stimulated by our date?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pssh.. in your dreams!” I rolled my eyes at Suyang. Then, I grabbed his collar. “What about you, huh? Why did you decide to write a love novel out of nowhere? Then later on, you gave up so easily… you were the one with ulterior motives, right? Tell the truth! Was it because you wanted to date me, so you used the novel as an excuse to get me on a date?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yup.” Suyang casually replied. </span></p>
 <p><span style>I felt a bit awkward but I couldn’t help but giggle. Ultimately, I had to cover my face and pretend to be shy. I punched Suyang lightly on the shoulder. “Oh you… how could you admit it so quickly! I am shy, you know?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was positive that Suyang shivered after hearing my words. He was staring and muttering at the ceiling. “Did you lose your IQ after you switched souls? How could you become so foolish and naive all of a sudden? Goldfish, you must conduct yourself well. Don’t take a wrong step in life…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say?” I threw away my fried chicken thigh and aggressively pinched Suyang’s face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yo! Yo!” Suyang was yelling. (tl: He’s saying “oil” in Mandarin. The pinyin is </span><i><span style>you</span></i><span style> but the </span><i><span style>u</span></i><span style> is silent so it sounds like </span><i><span style>yo</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What </span><i><span style>yo yo</span></i><span style>! I can say </span><i><span style>check it out</span></i><span style>!!! Are you going to keep smiling so mischievously?” I demanded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha! I’m talking about the oil on your hand! The oil! Cooking oil! Soya bean oil! Peanut oil!?!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was then I realized I had touched Suyang’s face without wiping my hands first. Now, his face was all shiny and greasy. </span><span style>It was like he hadn’t washed his face in 20 years. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s not play around and talk about something serious. I want to continue our 24 hour date!” I helped Suyang wipe the oil on his face as I suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re already a couple. We can go on a date whenever we want!” Suyang smoothly laid down on my leg and closed his eyes in a satisfied manner. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I’m talking about the continuation of our date from that day. It makes me sad to know we never finished it.” I whined to Suyang. </span><i><span style>Although whining never worked in the past, I wasn’t the type to give up so easily! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suyang mocked, “You have an injured arm, Warrior Yang. Where would you like to go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Suyang said I was Warrior Yang, I will act like Warrior Yang. “Gugu, please give permission to Guo’er! These past few days, Guo’er has been home and will turn moldy soon! At this rate, Guo’er will have feathers growing and become a bird!” I made a sullen face to try to gain Suyang’s pity. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then where do you want to go? It’s so cold… today, the weather is below 0 celcius…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to go to the beach; the same place where we went last time.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“But it’s so cold to go to the waters now! Are you sure you can handle it?” Suyang asked out of concern. </span></p>
 <p><span style>I nodded my head like mad. “It’s fine! I want to go! Take me!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Suyang lowered his head to think about it. He didn’t completely agree but he couldn’t deal with my whining. “Alright then. We’ll go to the beach. Change your clothes. We’ll go now!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!” I raised my hand in the air. I was still holding onto the tissue that I used to help Suyang wipe his face. Then, I ruthlessly shoved him off me as I hopped to my room to change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wash your hands first!” Hearing Suyang’s command, I took an emergency turn and dragged my injured arm as I went to wash my hands. Then, I changed into suitable clothing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since I knew it was freezing out, both Suyang and I wore our thickest down-filled jacket. I also had my hat, scarf, gloves and face mask in my bag just in case. With everything we were bringing, people might assume we were climbing Mount Everest instead. </span></p>
 <p><span style>We took the same route as last time. But this time, I wasn’t asleep the whole ride. Instead, I tried my best to remember everything that was passing by. This was my homeland. I never knew how much the word homeland meant until now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After an extremely long ride through the highway, I could vaguely see the sparkling ocean from a distance. I was itching to run towards it and experience the winter beauty. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Suyang parked the car in the parking lot, I ran out like a wild horse. Regardless of how many times Suyang called out, I didn’t turn around. I kept running towards the ocean. I didn’t even know why. The only thing I saw was the silver ocean and I wanted to jump right in to forget everything else. I wanted to continue running until I reached the ends of the Earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I used up all my strength to run and ended up slipping onto the beach. I fell down very hard. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goldfish?” Suyang shouted from behind me. He ran over and crouched down to help me up. “Are you hurt anywhere?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha! No. I am dressed in a very thick layer.” I continued laying on the sand with no intentions of getting up. I was smiling foolishly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Eventually, I patted the sand off my palms and sat on the ground. I pressed down Suyang’s shoulders to make him sit next to me as well. Then, I placed my head against his shoulder. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The second time is still so beautiful.” I sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The ocean looks beautiful regardless of when you see it.” Suyang placed his arm on my shoulder. “Just like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suyang’s sappiness was making me uncomfortable. “When did you learn how to say so much corny stuff? It’s giving me shivers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You're shivering because the weather is cold. Not because my words are corny.” Suyang inhaled and hugged me tighter. “Aside from watching the ocean, what else do you want to do?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know. I just want to be silent at this moment. I like sitting here with you. It would be nice if we can be like this forever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suyang was holding me so tightly that I could barely breathe. “I think it’s also pretty good. Why don’t we come here daily then? Should we buy a house nearby? Face the ocean? Watch the seasons change?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have money?” I gave Suyang a sideways glance. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve always had a lot of money.” Suyang gave me a kiss on the lips and replied like it was a matter of fact. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Psssh!” I shook my head. Then, I looked behind Suyang and my smile vanished. “You didn’t bring the bag with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What bag?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh…” I rolled my eyes and stood back up. “Give me your car keys. I’ll get it myself. I prepared something special!” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you trying to act mysterious?” Suyang was skeptical as he handed the car keys to me. I caught it and quickly ran back to the car to take out the polaroid from the bag. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I actually brought a box of photographic paper. Suyang and I barely had any photos together. I wanted to make use of today to take a bunch. </span></p>
 <p><span style>On my way back, I noticed Suyang was sitting alone by the shore. He looked like a picture from a magazine. His back view gave off a cold and lonely feeling. Could he sense what was going on? </span></p>
 <p><span style>I took a picture and placed it in my pocket before it had even developed. Then, I ran back like a child to show off my polaroid to Suyang. </span></p>
 <p><span style>I must say, today, my energy level was 100%. It was as if I had regressed into a child. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the special item? What is it called again? Pararoid? Polaroid?” Suyang took the polaroid from my hand and began to examine it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop speaking nonsense and let’s take a selfie to see the quality!” I placed a photographic paper in the camera and then leaned against Suyang to take a picture.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Darn it, every time Suyang and I were in the picture, it turned out defective</span></i><span style>. I gave up on him and told Suyang to help me take an individual photo. </span></p>
 <p><span style>I faced Suyang. With my back against the ocean, I had my hands around my mouth as I gathered all my strength and emotions to scream, “The person with the Su surname, I love you!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you take the picture?” After yelling, I ran back to check the photo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I pressed it a bit late. But this is not a video camera. Why were you suddenly confessing your love to me? It makes me feel weird….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earlier I was the shy one. Now, it was Suyang’s turn. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that photos can also record speech. From looking at the person’s expression, you could tell what emotions they were feeling and what they wanted to express.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After flinging the pictures for a long time, the photo was still not showing up. “Did it run out of ink or something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s take another one. Go and yell, ‘I love Suyang’!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“In your dreams! I’m not yelling anymore. I’m tired.” Then, I followed along the sandy shore and walked the other direction. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait for me! Why are you walking so fast today? You’re supposed to be a patient….” Suyang mumbled behind me. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha! Now you know who has short legs!” I joked. Then, I also made a face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Suyang spread out his arms and began running towards me. I quickly avoided it as I continued running. </span></p>
 <p><span style>-----</span></p>
 <p><span style>On December 17th, the weather was unusually nice. Early morning, I silently packed all my luggage. I left something on the coffee table and departed for City B. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ultimately, I never mentioned breaking up. I hoped that time will dilute everything and we’ll be safe and sound respectively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I ended up burning all the pictures we took at the beach. I placed all the ashes in the metal box. On top, I left a note: </span><i><span style>Let our past be ashes. If we’re fated, perhaps one day we’ll meet again when the flowers bloom. By then, I would’ve started a new life. I hope everything goes well with you. Don’t miss me. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, I still had the picture hidden in my pocket. It accompanied me to my destination.</span></p>
