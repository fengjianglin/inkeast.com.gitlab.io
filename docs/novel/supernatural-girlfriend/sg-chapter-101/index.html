 <p><b>Chapter 101: The awkward atmosphere</b></p>
 <p>Even though I knew was wrong, I didn’t like how the atmosphere was turning so bad between us.</p>
 <p>“But it’s Gao Jialan’s issue. I shouldn’t be the one to tell you about it...please don’t be mad…” I lightly tugged Suyang’s sleeve and tried to look pitiful.</p>
 <p>“If I hadn’t followed you today, what would’ve happened?” Suyang’s tone had improved a lot. Now, he sounded gentle instead of critical.</p>
 <p>“You were following me the whole time? Then, why didn’t you come over to help me get in? I was waiting at the entrance like a fool! That’s why the security guard caught me.”</p>
 <p>Suyang smacked my head lightly. “Since you can’t tell me about Gao Jialan, I can at least ask about you, right?”</p>
 <p>“Me?” I was confused.</p>
 <p>“I saw you at the television entrance talking to air, waving your hands around.”</p>
 <p>I already knew what he wanted to say. Before Suyang could finish his sentence, I hastily grabbed onto my chest and furrowed my brows. Then, I dramatically sat down. “Aiya! Aiyaya! I’m in pain…”</p>
 <p>“What?” Suyang held onto me. “Is it your old wound?”</p>
 <p>“I think I ran too fast, so it affected the gunshot wound. Oh noooo. I am in too much pain! I can’t handle it!” I limply laid in Suyang’s arms as my brain spun around like a whirlwind. <i>Oh no! Suyang caught me talking to Wen Yufan! </i></p>
 <p>“Are you really in pain?” Suyang was a bit suspicious.</p>
 <p>I tried my best to look like I was suffering and nodded like mad.&nbsp;<i>If only I could squeeze a few tears out right now… damn it! My acting skills need work!</i></p>
 <p>“Then let’s go to the hospital. Climb up!” Suyang turned around and bent down for me to climb onto his back.</p>
 <p>“I don’t want to go to the hospital. Let’s go home…” I carefully whimpered as I slowly scrambled onto Suyang’s back.</p>
 <p>While Suyang was carrying me, I could clearly see the green veins popping out around his neck and his bulging Adam’s apple. It was an extremely hot day. It must be quite a strenuous task to carry me. I used my hands to wipe the sweat off Suyang’s neck.</p>
 <p>But after wiping his neck, I couldn’t control my hands and they landed on Suyang’s Adam’s apple.</p>
 <p>Suyang froze on the spot. Two seconds later, he responded, “Are you actually in pain or are you pretending because you want to change the topic?"</p>
 <p>I instantly removed my hand and rested my head weakly on Suyang’s shoulder. I moaned about my imaginary illness. “I am in pain…My chest is hurting. Let’s not talk and hurry home!”</p>
 <p>Then, I smacked my right leg against Suyang’s butt and went, “Go!”</p>
 <p>Suyang couldn’t help but smile. “I’m telling you, we’re not done with this talk! After we get home, I’m going to have a chat with you. Don’t you dare think of escaping…” After a pause, he suddenly changed the direction of the conversation and smiled cunningly. “But if your chest area is hurting too much, I can take a look at it for you when we get home…”</p>
 <p>I smacked Suyang on the head. “Why is your mind always filled with dirty thoughts?”</p>
 <p>“You think you’re the only one who can tease me? I’m just reciprocating this type of behaviour!” Suyang retorted.</p>
 <p>“You and your fallacious reasoning!”</p>
 <p>“If you argue with me, I can’t guarantee you won’t fall off!” Suyang threatened as he tilted his body towards one side. I thought I was about to fall, so I held on tight like I was holding onto my dear life. Then, Suyang straightened his body.</p>
 <p>“Don’t play around like that!”</p>
 <p>Suyang loudly sighed. “I can’t tell who’s the boss and assistant anymore. It’s such a hot day, and I have to carry you! Go lose some weight. You’re too heavy!”</p>
 <p>I ignored Suyang’s words and continued to rest on his back. But I placed my hands above his eyes to help him shield from the Sun.</p>
 <p>“We ran too far. We’re so far from the car.” Suyang depressingly stared into a distant space. He was acting as if we had to cross the Sahara Desert.</p>
 <p>Along the way, he continued to mutter in resentment. From time to time, he would criticize my weight. I just secretly giggled on his back.</p>
 <p><i>Thank you for accommodating me. Thank you for trusting me...in every way…</i></p>
 <p>-----</p>
 <p>Although I managed to diverge the topic, I couldn’t guarantee I would be able to use the same tactic next time. If I didn’t think of a solution now, I was afraid that Suyang will question me again.</p>
 <p>In terms of Gao Jialan’s personal issue, I asked her to personally explain it to Suyang. After she told him what was going on, Suyang’s face darkened. Most likely, he was mad because I hid something so important from him…</p>
 <p>As a result, I had to sleep on the couch for two continuous nights. We were like a married couple; I was the husband that got kicked out.</p>
 <p>During our cold battle, Suyang wouldn’t say a single word to me. Each time I tried to get closer to him, he would automatically leave the area. At the same time, I was afraid if we conversed, he would question me about that day again.</p>
 <p>But avoiding was not a solution. After all, we haven’t gotten together for a long time. I felt like the so-called honeymoon period was like an eraser. Due to the mistakes I have made, it was disappearing with time.</p>
 <p>For the past few days, Gao Jialan and I were carefully surviving by observing Suyang’s behaviour. The atmosphere at home was very uncomfortable now.</p>
 <p>“Ka….ka….ka….” I was afraid that if I chewed my apple too loudly, it would affect Suyang. So I first bit my teeth into the apple and gazed at Suyang for his reaction. Then, I used the least amount of sound and the slowest tempo to chew.</p>
 <p>After I was halfway through, I suddenly felt a cold aura. It felt like there was a ghost coming near me…. No! It was more frightening than a ghost. I slowly turned around and saw Suyang staring right behind me.</p>
 <p><i>Awkward…. </i></p>
 <p><i>My teeth had already sunk into the apple. If I pull it out, it would be kind of gross. But if I didn’t, I would just leave it there because I didn’t dare to take a bite while he was watching me….</i></p>
 <p><i>It was tough holding on. I could feel the drool coming out…</i></p>
 <p><i>Is he going to say something or not? What’s his intention? Is he about to question me again? Or does he want to continue the cold battle?</i> I slowly got my hand ready. I was prepared to act again.</p>
 <p>“After you’re done eating the apple, tidy up. We’re going to go somewhere today.” Then, Suyang went to his room.</p>
 <p><i>He finally spoke to me! And it was a normal interaction! </i></p>
 <p>“I will do as you bid!” I happily saluted and devoured the rest of my apple. Then, I ran to my bedroom to pick out some clothes.</p>
 <p>“Are you heading out?” Gao Jialan must have heard Suyang speaking to me. She quietly tiptoed towards me as she held onto the door frame.</p>
 <p>“Yup!” I nodded confidently.</p>
 <p>Gao Jialan was relieved. “Suyang is finally speaking to you. Are you guys ok now?”</p>
 <p>“Maybe…” After selecting my outfit, I was experiencing mixed feelings. I was aware that lately Gao Jialan had been quite worried about my relationship with Suyang. So in order to lower her stresses, I lifted my spirit and gave her a brilliant smile. “We should be ok. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
 <p>“If you guys are ok, then that’s good. Or else, I will feel very guilty because it was my fault.” Gao Jialan looked down in shame as she touched her stomach.</p>
 <p>I stared at her little bump. <i>There’s a life inside….damn..it’s so magical.</i></p>
 <p>“Today, you’re probably going to eat by yourself. Are you ok with that?”</p>
 <p>“I’m not a child, of course I am!”</p>
 <p>-----</p>
 <p><i>After thinking about it, this should be my first official date with Suyang?! It's a date, right? I'm not sure</i>….</p>
 <p>I tried my best to do my makeup and then got Gao Jialan to evaluate. She gave me a helpless look and wiped everything off. She wanted to help me redo it.</p>
 <p><i>Was she the Leonardo Da Vinci of the makeup world?</i> Today, I finally learned something. But no matter how I looked at it, Gao Jialan’s creation did not seem natural at all. I was quite unsure about myself as she pushed me out into the living room.</p>
 <p>When Suyang made eye contact with me, I could instantly sense his shock. His body trembled a little, and then he slowly stood up. His voice was raspy. “Let’s go…”</p>
 <p>I touched my red powdered cheeks and flushed. The redness could be compared to those who remained high up on the Tibetan mountains for a week; lacking oxygen.</p>
 <p>But although I hesitated, I still left the apartment like this because I didn’t want to hurt Gao Jialan’s feelings.</p>
 <p>When my ghost bodyguard saw me, his eyes almost popped out. He placed his hands around his cheeks as if he wanted to tell me -<i>your cheeks look really weird like this</i>…</p>
 <p>I was walking behind Suyang. So I shook my head at my ghost bodyguard and mouthed the words, “It’s not my fault.”</p>
