 <p><b>Chapter 100: Almost caught!</b></p>
 <p>Wen Yufan slowly raised his right hand.</p>
 <p><i>Ohhhh..although he's kind of slow. At least, I can understand him now! I’m so smart! </i></p>
 <p>“Let me think… do you plan to stay by Gao Jialan’s side forever?”</p>
 <p>Left hand.</p>
 <p>“You don’t plan to stay with her forever? So, until she gives birth?”</p>
 <p>Left hand.</p>
 <p><i>What? My guesses were wrong? </i></p>
 <p>“Umm… was your car accident an accident?” Hearing my question, Wen Yufan appeared to hesitate. He stared at both his hands and couldn’t decide.</p>
 <p>“Forget it. It’s better I don’t know. Even if I know, there’s nothing I can do about it. I’m not going to ask anymore. Don’t tell me!” I closed my eyes. After a long pause, I sneaked a glance at Yufan. I didn’t fully open my eyes until I was certain that Yufan wasn’t going to respond.</p>
 <p>“Aiya!” I sighed aloud, “I feel like you and Gao Jialan are like those couples from romance novels… you know, the type when a rich young master falls in love with a poor Cinderella. You guys must have gone through a lot of obstacles in order to end up together, right? Poor you. Now, you guys are separated by yin and yang…” I regretted it the moment those words slipped out.</p>
 <p><i>As the saying goes, the more you say, the more mistakes you'll make! </i></p>
 <p>“I was just making a casual comment. Please don’t take it to heart!” I quickly apologized to Wen Yufan.</p>
 <p>It just so happened that the security guard who had previously blocked me from entering was heading in my direction.</p>
 <p>“What do you want now? I already stated I’m not entering the television station. You’re still dissatisfied? Is the road part of your company’s territory? Do you have a certificate to show me? Property of ownership?” I irritably crossed my arms.</p>
 <p>I was the type that held grudges.</p>
 <p>Who would’ve thought the security guard’s attitude would turn a 180 degree? He had his hands politely on top of each other in front of him. In addition, he even smiled at me. “No. You’ve mistaken…I am here to tell you that you may enter, Miss. Someone has requested for you.”</p>
 <p>“I can enter?” I excitedly look around. Then, I placed my hands down and calmly asked, “Why are you suddenly letting me in now? Who is requesting for me?”</p>
 <p>“A large stockholder of the television station. You will find out once you’re inside.”</p>
 <p>“Large...stockholder?” I had a bad feeling about this. I made eye contact with Wen Yufan and recalled that his family was a large stockholder of this television station. <i>They have already investigated and found out about me? </i></p>
 <p><i>Wen Yihan? </i></p>
 <p>Suddenly, I began stretching and slowly backed away as I carefully watched the security guard’s every move. I lightly stated, “I just remember I have some emergency errands to run...umm… I don’t need to go in anymore…”</p>
 <p>I wanted to escape, but there were already other security guards blocking my path behind me.</p>
 <p><i>Did I just walk into a trap? I can’t believe I'm the one who screwed myself over!? </i>Initially, I didn’t think I would be so unlucky to bump into Wen Yihan. That was why I was so fearless when I came.</p>
 <p><i>We had never interacted before. If he wanted to see me, it must be because he discovered that I’m the vine that will lead him to the melon…</i></p>
 <p><i>I really don’t want to get into another battle with the wealthy</i>…</p>
 <p>“What are you guys trying to do in broad daylight?” Although I was afraid, I must hide it. This was a public place. If I didn’t want to leave, they couldn’t forcefully drag me away, right?</p>
 <p>I was prepared to create an unreasonable scene.</p>
 <p>“Miss, our large stockholder has specifically invited you to his office. He has something to say to you.” A security guard wearing a pair of black sunglasses solemnly stated.</p>
 <p>I shook my head. “I don’t know any large stockholder. I refuse to go!”</p>
 <p>The only thing I could do right now was to drag the conversation out as long as I could to buy myself more time. Then, I must find an opportunity to flee.</p>
 <p>“Miss, please don’t make my job difficult…”</p>
 <p>“What’s your problem? Why do you keep referring me as Miss? I have a name. Want to bet I will write a complaint about you if you keep doing this?”</p>
 <p>“Then, your name…”</p>
 <p>“Why should I tell you my name? I don’t know you. Do you tell your name to random strangers?” I snapped.</p>
 <p>The security guard: …...</p>
 <p>“It’s such a hot summer day, yet a group of men is trying to surround me. Is that appropriate? No! Go away! Go go go! If not, I’m going to scream sexual harassment!” I lifted my finger up to threaten.</p>
 <p>“Miss, I suggest you to go upstairs to see our large stockholder. If not, he'll come down very shortly.”</p>
 <p><i>Oh my goodness. I forgot one crucial point. Wen Yihan could move! Even if I don’t go see him, he can still come see me…. No, there was no time left. I must escape as soon as possible!</i></p>
 <p>Just as I was racking my brain thinking of an escape plan, I heard a familiar voice that puts me at ease. The corners of my mouth curved into a smile. As expected…</p>
 <p>“What are you security guards trying to do to my girlfriend?” Through the gaps of the security guards, I could see Suyang with his hands in his pocket. His face was stern as he walked over coolly with swag.</p>
 <p>Then, in front of everyone, Suyang shoved a security guard away and pulled me into his arms. He raised my chin. “Are you being bullied at the television station?”</p>
 <p>“Ignore them. Let’s go….” I quietly whispered to Suyang.</p>
 <p>“Our large stockholder wants to see this lady. Or perhaps, Sir, you can come with us too….”</p>
 <p>“See what large stockholder?” <i>I don’t know where Suyang learnt how to be so gangster. But he was pro. Did he watch a lot of gangster movies?</i></p>
 <p>“I don’t know. I don’t know any stockholder, but they won’t let me leave!” I began to pull on Suyang’s clothes as I whined like a victim.</p>
 <p>While I was speaking, the security guards made their moves. This time, Suyang was also surrounded.</p>
 <p>“Ughh… so troublesome. We can’t meet this stockholder?” Suyang asked me.</p>
 <p>I shook my head. <em>Definitely not!</em> I didn’t know how else to explain it to him. But there was no time to explain anyway.</p>
 <p>“Hm.. we can’t meet him…” Suyang lowered his head and thought about it for a second. Then, he transmitted a message to me with his eyes. “If we cannot meet him, there’s only one method we could take!”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” I whispered anxiously.</p>
 <p>Suyang held onto my hand. His thumb was tapping in a predictable rhythm. “One, two, three!”</p>
 <p>When he got to three, Suyang forcefully shoved a security guard and we hurriedly broke through the space and ran as fast as we could.</p>
 <p>I disregarded the weather and my image as I ran with Suyang. Although I could save some energy since he was dragging me along, it was still not an easy task to keep up the same speed as him.</p>
 <p>I was already out of breath in a matter of minutes.</p>
 <p>“Let’s not run anymore. No more! They’re gone!?” I wasn’t sure how many streets we had passed by, but I was so exhausted, I could barely catch my breath. I had to stop Suyang. “I can’t run anymore…”</p>
 <p>The two of us found a safe spot to rest. I secretly peeked at Suyang. His complexion didn’t look good. Suddenly, Suyang gazed at me very intently. I was so surprised that I quickly avoided his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Is there something you want to ask me?” I mumbled like a guilty child. I didn’t dare to raise my head.</p>
 <p>“There are a lot of things I want to ask you. You know why? Because you hide so much from me!” Suyang roared.</p>
 <p>I remained silent. I wondered what he was going to say next.</p>
 <p>“I want to know why the stockholder wants to meet you, yet you refuse to meet him?” Suyang pressed me against the wall. His arms were on my left and right side, preventing me from escaping. His eyes were flashing.</p>
 <p>“Umm.. he’s someone I don’t know…. It’s related to Gao Jialan…” I muttered.</p>
 <p>Suyang couldn’t hear what I said and asked me to repeat it.</p>
 <p>“It’s related to Gao Jialan. I don’t have the right to talk about it…”</p>
 <p>Suyang placed one hand on my shoulder and the other on my chin. He lifted my chin to make me look at him in the eye. I could tell he was trying to suppress his anger.</p>
 <p>“Right now, Gao Jialan is living with us. If there is something going on, I should have the right to know. You have always been hiding so much from me. It really bothers me.”</p>
