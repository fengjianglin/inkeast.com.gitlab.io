 <p><b>Chapter 129: I’ve decided</b></p>
 <p>“I’m….Grandmother Meng’s client! As for what happened here, I don’t know. It was already a mess when I came.”</p>
 <p>“Grandmother’s client?” Suyang narrowed his eyes to indicate his lack of trust towards me.</p>
 <p>“Hi! You must be Suyang?” I lightly punched Suyang on the shoulder. <i>That was how guys say hi, right? </i></p>
 <p>“Grandmother Meng often brings you up. You’re his wonderful grandson, eh? Hahaha! I think she’s busy today so I guess I’m going to go too! Bye!”</p>
 <p>Just as I was about to leave, Suyang blocked me.</p>
 <p>“Wait!”</p>
 <p>“Wait...what…?” Suyang grabbed my arm and wouldn’t let go. Then, with his other hand, he dialed a number.</p>
 <p>Grandmother Meng’s cell phone began to ring on the table.</p>
 <p><i>Alright, I admit...Grandmother Meng is missing and there’s a mysterious man in her apartment. I’m definitely very suspicious…. But what could I say? Directly tell Suyang I’m Lin Yixin? He’s going to think I’m insane! Plus, earlier I was already planning to tell Xialing I’ll leave so that everyone could remain safe</i>…</p>
 <p>“Have I seen you from somewhere before?”</p>
 <p>My heart thumped. <i>Could Suyang recognize me? No way!? We aren’t at the stage where we could see through each others’ souls yet!</i></p>
 <p>“You look very familiar to me…”</p>
 <p><i>Oh yeah! I am Anson now. “We” used to be childhood playmates. Although that happened years ago, there must still be some sort of resemblance. It wasn’t all that weird Suyang thought my face looked familiar. </i></p>
 <p>“Most people often say I look like someone they know. Maybe I just have a face catered to the mass? Haha…” I pulled my arm out of Suyang’s grasp.</p>
 <p>Suyang went over to Grandmother Meng’s desk and picked up her phone. Based on his expression, I could tell his brain was speculating. I wanted to silently slip out while he was focused.</p>
 <p>“Where do you think you’re going?” Suyang’s voice rang from behind me.</p>
 <p>“I...er… Grandmother Meng isn’t here right now. There’s no reason for me to remain here.”</p>
 <p>“My grandma is missing and you are at the scene of the crime. You cannot leave!”</p>
 <p><i>Darn it. I couldn’t even escape if I wanted to.</i> “So what do you want?”</p>
 <p>“Go to the police station with me! We are reporting the case to the authorities.” Suyang grabbed my collar and dragged me. He was totally treating me like a man. He was so rough!</p>
 <p>Seeing how aggressive Suyang was acting, Xialing instantly knew I did not tell him the truth. She ran and blocked us, “What do you think you’re doing?”</p>
 <p>I was trying to use my eyes to seek for help. I wanted her to think of a solution for us.</p>
 <p>“Oh yes. You’re also a suspect. You must go to the police station with us.” With his other hand, Suyang grabbed onto Xialing’s pigtails and dragged us both with him.</p>
 <p>“Think of a plan! You’re a man right now….”</p>
 <p>“Wait! Wait! We can’t go to the police station. Let me go and let’s have a civilized chat!” I yelled. However, Suyang ignored me. I had no choice but to shout, “I -I know how to find Grandmother Meng!”</p>
 <p>As expected, Suyang halted his steps, “What did you say?”</p>
 <p>“Lend me your cell phone! I can find Grandmother Meng.”</p>
 <p>I ignored Suyang’s suspicious glance as I repeated, “Give me your cell phone for a moment.”</p>
 <p>“What are you going to do with it?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. I won’t run off with it. If you want to find Grandmother Meng, just listen to me!”</p>
 <p>“You better tell me what you know. Or else, I swear to God you’re going to die a pitiful death!” Suyang glared at me. This was the first time he had ever threatened me so cruelly before. I was annoyed.</p>
 <p><i>If you know I’m Lin Yixin, you wouldn’t behave like this! Humph! </i></p>
 <p>“Alright, how about I give my phone to you, and you give me yours to make a call. Ok?” I involuntarily pushed Xialing and made her help me and Suyang exchange phones.</p>
 <p>“You better remain in an area I could see you. If you plan to run, you’re dead! You’re a suspect!” Suyang warned.</p>
 <p>I turned around and rolled my eyes. Then, I took Suyang’s phone and went over to a far corner where he could still see me but not hear me as I dialed my number.</p>
 <p>Since Anson was acting as me, he must be using my phone.</p>
 <p>“What is it, Suyang?” Anson picked up almost instantaneously. Clearly, Suyang was top priority for him.</p>
 <p>“I’m not Suyang. Can you guess who I am? I’m the woman whom you almost sent to a mental institution. Actually, I’m a man now….” I threatened.</p>
 <p>“You have Suyang’s phone? You went to find him?” Even through the phone, I could hear Anson gritting his teeth.</p>
 <p>It was definitely not a good idea to piss him off. So, I decided to calm him down, “Don’t worry, I haven’t said anything to Suyang. I am making a call because I wanted to let you know I’ve made my decision.”</p>
 <p>“You want to negotiate with me?”</p>
 <p>“Yes. Grandmother Meng is in your hands, right?”</p>
 <p>“Yup. That old woman is very against your relationship with Suyang. I was just lectured a big deal. She talked too much so I’m letting her sleep for a bit.”</p>
 <p>“You can’t hurt her!”</p>
 <p>“You think it’s up to you to decide?”</p>
 <p>“She’s Suyang’s only family member. If you do something to her, he’ll never forgive you.”</p>
 <p>“No, from now on, I’m Suyang’s family. I’ll be his only family member.” Anson’s bigotry was strong.</p>
 <p>“If you let Grandmother Meng go and promise you won’t hurt anyone else, I’ll promise to let you be Lin Yixin for the rest of your life. You can get what you want.”</p>
 <p>“Do you think I’m stupid? If you don’t have Grandmother Meng, you definitely can’t get your body back. With a face of a man, Suyang is not going to believe you regardless.”</p>
 <p>“You want to bet?” These days, my threatening skills have improved substantially. Anson didn’t respond.</p>
 <p>“I guarantee I won’t show up in front of Suyang ever again. You are Lin Yixin and I’ll be Anson. We’ll be like this forever as long as you let Grandmother Meng go.”</p>
 <p>“Why should I trust you?”</p>
 <p>“I am using Suyang’s cell phone but I didn’t tell him the truth. You still can’t trust me? I’m being sincere right now.”</p>
 <p>“Why are you doing this?’</p>
 <p>“I want to save Grandmother Meng. If my departure will ensure everyone’s safety, I’m willing to compromise.”</p>
 <p>Anson began to laugh, “Don’t make yourself sound like a saint… you better not try to fool me. Or else, all of you will die! Fine, if you don’t want to go to Japan, I’ll prepare something else for you. After your departure has been verified, I will release Grandmother Meng.”</p>
 <p>“Alright. Deal.” I hung up. My heart felt very heavy.</p>
 <p>The instant I realized I might never see Suyang again in my lifetime, I didn't want to turn around. I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to control my tears if I saw his face.</p>
 <p>I was a man right now. <i>What type of man cries so easily? </i></p>
 <p>I slowly began to re-adjust my emotions and deleted the record of the call. Then, I casually walked over to Suyang and handed him back his phone. “At the latest, Grandmother Meng should be home by tomorrow night.”</p>
 <p>“Who did you talk to?” Suyang was going through the records but I had already deleted it. “You’re really a suspicious person. Who are you?!” Suyang glared at me.</p>
 <p>“A person you don’t know.” I coolly replied.</p>
 <p>“You look so familiar.”</p>
 <p>“To be honest, Grandmother Meng is missing because she was helping me. But I’ve already located her. Sorry for all the troubles I’ve caused you.” I gave Suyang a bow. Then, I got up and gave Xialing a “we should leave” look.</p>
 <p>“You want to leave again? Do you think I’ll let you leave when I know the reason why my granny is missing is because of you? You must remain within my field of vision until my grandma is back.”</p>
 <p>“Believe me, she’ll come back soon!”</p>
 <p>“Why should I trust you?” Suyang still wouldn’t let go. At this rate, I was worried I wouldn’t be able to control my emotions.</p>
 <p>I lowered my head and avoided his eyes, “Please, just trust me once!”</p>
 <p>“No! Until I’m certain my grandma is back, I won’t let you go!”</p>
 <p>“Suyang!” I yelled. I made up my mind and decisively made eye contact with him, “Trust me. I know I may be a stranger to you, but please look me in the eye. You’ll trust me.”</p>
 <p>For some reason, maybe I was superstitious; but I was quite certain that regardless of what I had turned into, Suyang will trust me after seeing the sincerity in my eyes.</p>
 <p>“Strange. My intuition is telling me to trust you. But if you dare to lie to me, I’ll make sure you will die without your corpse.” Suyang finally released his grip on my arm.</p>
 <p>“Just in case!” Suyang took out his phone and “ka cha” a photo of me before I could react.</p>
 <p>“If you are really a criminal, I’ll take your picture to the police station and get them to arrest you!”</p>
 <p>“Yes yes, whatever!” I grabbed Xialing and the two of us left.</p>
 <p>“You’ve decided to leave?” Xialing leaned over and whispered.</p>
 <p>“Yes, after hearing your suggestion, I think it’s the best solution. At least, I can save someone if I go.” I looked off into the distance and couldn’t help but feel depressed.</p>
 <p>“Regardless of where you go, I’ll follow you!”</p>
 <p>I was surprised to hear this from Xialing. It was touching but I softly refused, “I’ll be fine on my own. Why would I make you leave your native home as well?”</p>
 <p>“You make it sound like you’re being sent away to serve a penal sentence.” She complained.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t it true? I have to leave my native town and live elsewhere for the rest of my life.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t think of it like that. Perhaps, you’ll realize you prefer living abroad after you begin your new life! Maybe your new life will be better than your current one!”</p>
 <p>“True. My life is already such a mess. Could it get any worse? Look at me. I have been a woman for 26 years and now I’m a man!”</p>
 <p>“Umm...a very hot man….” Xialing muttered.</p>
 <p>Anson was very efficient. I could tell how badly he wanted me to disappear. Within a few hours, he already had the airfare, passport, visa, and everything prepared.</p>
 <p>Xialing and I went to a nearby mall for three hours. Then, she directly took me to the airport. During the three hours, I took a last glimpse of my native land for the past 26 years.</p>
 <p>“Although Anson says there will be someone waiting for you in United States, you should still have some sort of luggage. It would be very inconvenient if you don’t have anything. Why don’t you fetch your boarding pass while I go nearby to get you some items for daily use?”</p>
 <p>“No, it’s fine. Ever since my soul was swapped, you’ve been a tremendous help. You’re not even related to me. I feel like I owe you a lot…”</p>
 <p>“Who says we’re not related? If my brother was still alive, he would’ve probably beat Suyang to it! You would probably already be my sister-in-law!”</p>
 <p>“You and your naughty mouth.” I rubbed her head. I knew Xialing liked intimate acts from me as I had Anson’s face.</p>
 <p>I watched as Xialing diligently left. I stood in line and waited to get my boarding pass.</p>
