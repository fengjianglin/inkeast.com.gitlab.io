 <p><b>Chapter 89: Mi Fan’s POV (Part 2)</b></p>
 <p>There was a very long and silent pause between the two of us. Finally, my cheesecake came. It dissolve the awkwardness between us.</p>
 <p>Suyang stared at the cheesecake and macchiato. “Are you under a lot of stress lately? That’s a lot of sugar intake.”</p>
 <p>I was about to take a bite out of my cheesecake, but my hand hovered in mid air.</p>
 <p>I tried making sense of what Suyang said. <i>Was it a harmless question? Or was he implying something? </i></p>
 <p><i>No, that’s not possible. Why would he?</i> These days, I’ve been overly suspicious of everything. I convinced myself that it was just a random question.</p>
 <p>“Don’t females like to eat sweet desserts? Although I have to cast aside my gender as a reporter, I will not abandon desserts.”</p>
 <p>I was trying to tell a joke as I continued the conversation.</p>
 <p>For some reasons, I felt like there was someone watching me from outside. I turned towards the window. I wanted to know where that strange feeling was coming from.</p>
 <p>“Don’t look!” Suyang suddenly grabbed my hand. “Don’t look out the window. Be natural and exchange conversation with me.”</p>
 <p>“Is there something outside?” His behaviour and tone of voice evoked my curiosity. I tightly my grip on my fork.</p>
 <p>“My assistant is hiding behind a bush outside the window. I don’t want her to know that we’ve discovered her. I want her to get more mosquito bites.”</p>
 <p>Suyang had a crafty smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“Then what do you want to talk about? Don’t you find our atmosphere really awkward?”</p>
 <p>“Let’s talk about the case you were responsible for. I’m sure you’re aware that I’m a speculative online author. Usually, I’m very interested in criminal cases. They trigger and inspire my creation.”</p>
 <p>“You should be asking the police for this sort of stuff. Why are you asking a small reporter like myself?”</p>
 <p>“Small reporter? You’re a reporter that knows more than the cops! Am I right?” Suyang slightly leaned forward as he smiled deeply at me.</p>
 <p>“You think too highly of me. I wonder, which case are you interested in?”</p>
 <p>“I am….” Suyang’s facial expression suddenly changed as he rushed to pull me out of my seat. Then, I heard the sounds of shattering glass.</p>
 <p>“Are you alright?” I could hear Suyang’s voice from above my head.</p>
 <p>By the time I snapped out of my daze, I was already in his arms. Everyone else were screaming and the atmosphere had turned very fearful and chaotic.</p>
 <p><i>I was the target of the attack. But why was I the calmest one? </i></p>
 <p>“I’m fine.” I re-adjusted my breathing and stared at the main culprit of this act; Lu Zhengyang. This wasn’t the first time he had tried to attack me. In reality, he had attacked me so many times that I’ve lost count.</p>
 <p>Lu Zhengyang still wanted to do something, but he was subdued by Suyang.</p>
 <p>Two girls clumsily rushed in. <i>One of them should be Suyang’s assistant? The girl wearing a school uniform looked too young. So most likely, it was the other one…</i></p>
 <p>I observed Suyang lecturing her. Right now, she was the only one in his eyes.</p>
 <p>As a reporter, I had a good sense of intuition.</p>
 <p>Lu Zhengyang continued to verbally abuse me. I listened to it all over again. After he was done, I pretended not to care as I proudly left the coffee shop.</p>
 <p>When I got into my car, I locked the doors and had both my hands gripping on the steering wheel. Every time I see the vengeful Lu Zhengyang, Lu Wenxue’s face would appear in my mind and remain there.</p>
 <p>His case was my most serious, exceeding general knowledge, and terrifying case.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t because it was naturally vile or that he had committed a terrible crime.</p>
 <p>It was because I was the one who created his crimes.</p>
 <p>This was the first time I had experienced what it was like to step on someone in order to climb up.</p>
 <p>As someone in the media field, I knew how to attract readers’ attention. I knew how to trigger the public. The chairman’s family told me that the Lu Wenxue case was my best case.</p>
 <p>Because not only was I able to control the mass, I was also able to control their judgment. It was already beyond the abilities of what an average reporter could do. I was a very capable person.</p>
 <p><i>Exceeded beyond a reporter’s scope of work?</i> What a joke. Reporters were supposed to report real news. <i>What have I turned into?</i></p>
 <p>The Lu Wenxue case was already something I couldn’t reverse. And something I didn’t dare to touch. I was even afraid to show my remorse.</p>
 <p>The sinful plant growing inside my heart was constantly torturing me. Whenever I saw Lu Zhengyang, it was at its worse.</p>
 <p>I was a normal human being who had a lot of self-interest. I knew the higher I climbed, the harder I’d fall.</p>
 <p>A few days later, Suyang personally gave me a call.</p>
 <p>I was pleasantly surprised.</p>
 <p>But I was still logical. After our date, I hired a private detective to find out more about Suyang. As expected, it wasn’t a waste.</p>
 <p>After the investigation, I was certain that Suyang came to me in regards to Lu Wenxue’s case.</p>
 <p>Logically, I should’ve told the chairman about Suyang and his little assistant so that he could’ve helped me gotten rid of them. But I never said anything.</p>
 <p>When the assistant had tailed me to the hotel, it was practically catching a turtle in a jar. Yet, I still let her off.</p>
 <p><i>When did I become so kind? </i></p>
 <p>Suddenly, I felt as if I was able to poke out my head from the sludge and take a breath.</p>
 <p>There was a rope in front of me.</p>
 <p><i>Was it an indication that it will pull me ashore?</i></p>
 <p>It was like a fish bait. But I wasn’t sure if a delicious meal would await me or the pain of a hooked lip.</p>
 <p>After hesitating again and again, I decided to hold onto the rope.</p>
 <p>So, early on, I already told Suyang everything. That way, he wouldn’t have to pretend or act around me. The man’s charm was my bait.</p>
 <p>Actually, Suyang’s appearance was more like my path to redemption. Because of him, I was finally able to express what I have hidden all of last year. By telling him all this, I was basically handing my life to him.</p>
 <p><i>How could I have so much trust in a man I barely knew?</i></p>
 <p>Afterwards, I realized it wasn’t because I trusted Suyang. At that moment, regardless of who had thrown me the rope, I would have taken it. I was fortunate that Suyang pulled me back ashore.</p>
 <p>Later on, I understood something else. I wasn’t actually evil beyond cure. It was that no one had ever tried to stop me…</p>
 <p>I placed the early photo of me as a reporter next to my mother’s grave. I no longer deserved to keep it. So, I shall allow it to accompany my mother’s side.</p>
 <p>Once, the person who hated my guts and wanted to pour sulfuric acid on me had been smiling proudly next to me. Those days were gone forever.</p>
 <p><i>We always tend to reminisce the past….</i></p>
 <p>This is my redemption.</p>
