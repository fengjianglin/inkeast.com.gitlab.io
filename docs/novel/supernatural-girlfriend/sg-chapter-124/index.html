 <p><b>Chapter 124: Overwhelmed</b></p>
 <p>“Grandma! That’s enough!” Suyang yelled.</p>
 <p><i>I never knew the cause of Suyang’s parents’ death. I went as far as making Suyang join me in Japan</i>…</p>
 <p>Suddenly, my heart was throbbing. <i>Suyang</i>….</p>
 <p>“After that incident, Xiao Su and I cut all ties with the child. We returned to China and began a new life. In case history repeats itself, I always try my best to separate myself from Xiao Su. That is why we don’t live together. Even if accidents were to occur, at least he wouldn’t be affected…..”</p>
 <p>“Grandma. Enough. What’s the point of telling her this? Yixin isn’t that child. She wouldn’t…”</p>
 <p>“That’s why it’s even more dangerous! Lin Yixin has the abilities but she doesn’t know how to control it! The evil spirits can take advantage of her!”</p>
 <p><em>Suddenly, I felt very useless…. Why was I here? I really wanted to disappear. It didn’t matter where; as long as I could disappear.</em></p>
 <p>Now, I understood why Suyang was so afraid of ghosts. His parents died because of them. That incident must be a very traumatic moment he’ll never get over. I couldn’t help but imagine how he felt when he found out I could see ghosts.</p>
 <p><i>Did it remind him of the past? If so, what was he thinking? Why did he choose not to tell me about that part of his life?</i></p>
 <p>“Lin Yixin, I know you’re a good child. I hope you’ll reconsider and make the correct decision.” Then, Grandmother Meng left very confidently. She was positive that I would do as she wanted.</p>
 <p><i>No! I can’t handle this. I wanted to run away. I wanted to leave. </i></p>
 <p>Suyang seemed to have read my mind and snatched my hand. His voice was hoarse, “You’re leaving?”</p>
 <p>I pushed Suyang’s hand off me and held onto my buzzing head, “I’m going to get some fresh air. My mind is a mess right now. Please give me some time to process everything.”</p>
 <p>“No need to think about it. Stay by my side. You are you. Nothing will happen…”</p>
 <p>“How can you be so sure that nothing will happen? I can’t even guarantee….deep down, I’ve always known that my ability will cause you problems one day. Just like Grandmother Meng said, I cannot control it. I don’t know how to get out of dangerous situations either. But I try to avoid thinking about it because I’m afraid I’ll regress into what I used to be. I’m just selfish for wanting you to stay with me a bit longer…”</p>
 <p>“Why can’t it work out? There’s no issues between us right now!”</p>
 <p>“Ever since you found out that I could see ghosts, you’ve never thought back about the accident? I’m like a reminder, right? Being with me will always remind you of your parents’ death since their death was caused by a person who could see ghosts. The ghosts killed them.”</p>
 <p>“That’s my problem. Not yours. I can deal with it myself.” Suyang’s determined pupils were trying to sway me. The moment I made eye contact with him, I felt hesitant.</p>
 <p>“No, it is my problem. As long as I appear in front of you, you’ll be constantly reminded of your past. I’ve never told you but I had almost been possessed once. Likewise, you’ve never told me about your past. It is because we’re both afraid to lose each other….”</p>
 <p>“Since we’re both afraid to lose each other, we should be together and face it together.” Suyang grabbed onto my shoulders to emphasize his true heart.</p>
 <p>“Suyang….give me some time to think about it. I-I.. can’t face you right now. I feel so ashamed and sorry. Please let me get some fresh air.”</p>
 <p>This time, Suyang didn’t stop me. He gradually released my shoulders and said, “You will make the correct decision, right?”</p>
 <p><i>Correct decision? Grandmother Meng wanted me to make the correct decision. Suyang also wanted me to make the correct decision. But what is the correct decision? Should I do what Grandmother Meng wanted? Or Suyang? Or what I want? &nbsp;</i></p>
 <p>Honestly, I didn’t even know what I wanted. A part of me didn’t want to separate from Suyang at all. But another part of me was willing to leave him in order to keep him safe.</p>
 <p>My mind was having a battle with each other. It was like tug-a-war. Both sides wouldn’t budge.</p>
 <p>Ultimately, I was torn in half as I fell onto the ground.</p>
 <p>Half of me stared at each other, “Are you the correct decision?”</p>
 <p>-----</p>
 <p>Everything happened too fast. I wandered on the streets alone. The argument I had with Suyang over food seemed like it happened a century ago. Now, it was only a distant memory.</p>
 <p>I wasn’t sure how long I’ve walked for or where I have gone. But by the time I snapped back to reality, I realized I didn’t have a single spot to take a rest.</p>
 <p>“Yixin, it’s really you?”</p>
 <p>Someone was calling my name. I was currently sitting on the side of the road as I looked up. Shen Shaoqian’s flashy car was in front of me.</p>
 <p>“Why are you out here by yourself? Get on!?”</p>
 <p>“I came out for a breath of fresh air. Don’t mind me.” I decided to ignore him and got up to walk away.</p>
 <p>Shen Shaoqian got off his car and blocked me. He acted like a gentleman, “It’s too late! How could I allow you to walk alone by yourself?! I’ll take you home.”</p>
 <p>I flung Shen Shaoqian’s arm away and frowned, “No! You go do whatever you were doing. I want to be alone.”</p>
 <p>After I made that statement, I realized I was a bit rude. So, I quickly added, “I’m not in a good mood right now. I’m not purposely trying to give you attitude. Don’t worry, I’ll be fine. Just go.”</p>
 <p>“No! Get on the car. We can chat about it while we’re inside, okay?” Shen Shaoqian blocked me with his arms spread apart. “I won’t give up until you get on.”</p>
 <p>Seeing how persistent he was, I decided to listen to him. Most likely, Suyang called Shen Shaoqian and told him to keep an eye out for me. We kind of owe him for always being there.</p>
 <p>The car began to move. I didn’t ask where we were going as I leaned against the seat to rest. Perhaps we were too silent, so Shen Shaoqian asked, “Did you and Suyang have a fight?”</p>
 <p>“No need to be so indirect about it. Suyang probably already told you, right?” I stared at the outside scenery. Shen Shaoqian was driving really slowly. I opened the window and stuck my head out to feel the cool breeze. My heart was in chaos right now.</p>
 <p>“Although we’re close, he doesn’t tell me everything, you know?”</p>
 <p>“Then why are you here?” Shen Shaoqian wasn’t driving towards the direction of the apartment, so I felt better.</p>
 <p>“Me? I was going to come find you and Suyang to discuss about what to do this Christmas. It’ll be Christmas in a month. We had so much fun in Japan, so I was wondering if you guys wanted to go on another trip. Perhaps we can go skiing in Switzerland."</p>
 <p>“I’m so curious. Don’t you ever have to work?! You’re always playing and goofing around.”</p>
 <p>“I’m a rich second generation! Plus, I have my own company. Obviously, I can do as I please.” Shen Shaoqian proudly bragged.</p>
 <p>“Then go wherever you want. I’m not going to join you….”</p>
 <p>“Why not? You don’t want to go to Switzerland? Then pick something else. For example….” Shen Shaoqian began to chatter nonstop. I guess he really wanted to go on a trip again.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, I was curious, “When did you and Suyang meet?”</p>
 <p>“We met when we were children. We grew up together. Why are you asking?”</p>
 <p><i>That means</i>…. “So do you know what happened to Suyang during his time in Japan?”</p>
 <p>The car suddenly came to an emergency stop. I looked up and noticed that there was only a 10 cm difference between our car and the car in front of us. We almost crashed.</p>
 <p>Shen Shaoqian was shocked but quickly recovered and continued forward. “I was so focused on our conversation, we almost crashed! Umm. When Suyang was in Japan, we weren’t together. I was in China, so I don’t know what happened to him. But when he returned with his grandmother, I found out his parents died in Japan.”</p>
 <p>I frowned, “Why didn’t Suyang mention it to me before? I feel terrible. Suyang had such a painful time in Japan yet we went there for vacation…”</p>
 <p>“Don’t make things up in your head! It happened so long ago! Suyang isn’t the type to hold grudges.” Shen Shaoqian replied.</p>
 <p><i>Really?</i> But Shen Shaoqian wasn’t even there. So, there was no point in telling him about what happened. Furthermore, his tone didn’t sound that confident.</p>
 <p>“So why were you two arguing?”</p>
 <p>“Arguing? When did I say we were arguing?” <i>Did it count as an argument? I wasn’t sure. </i></p>
 <p>“Why else would you be wandering on the streets so late at night?”</p>
