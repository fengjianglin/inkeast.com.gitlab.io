 <p><b>Chapter 9: I was gradually becoming Suyang’s nanny</b></p>
 <p>“You!” I heatedly snatched the contract from Suyang’s hands, “Fine! You win!”</p>
 <p>Just as I was about to leave, Suyang blocked me.</p>
 <p>“What else do you want?”</p>
 <p>Suyang looked at me like I was a hopeless child as he placed his hand on the top of my head and roughly turned it towards the clock against the wall.</p>
 <p>“Goldfish, it’s 7:12am. It is time for you to fulfill your obligations from the contract. Time for you to prepare breakfast.”</p>
 <p>“What? Do you think I’m nanny?”</p>
 <p>“In the contract, it states that you are responsible for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So you can go prepare breakfast now. I am not a picky eater. I will eat anything.”</p>
 <p>Then, Suyang took out 200rmb from his wallet. “Food allowance.”</p>
 <p>I took the 200rmb and thought of a plan.</p>
 <p>I truly wanted to say, you’ll eat anything, right? If I am the one buying, I’ll definitely buy you the “highest quality” breakfast to match your “high class” image.</p>
 <p>I smiled cunningly behind Suyang’s back as I took his 200rmb and casually grabbed my jacket. I left the door without washing my face. Deep down, I was thinking, “You want to have sandwiches with milk? Bread with jam? The typical standard breakfast? Dream on!”</p>
 <p>In less than ten minutes, I had returned back from a breakfast place around the neighbourhood. I was carrying a lot of food.</p>
 <p>“I have breakfast here. Come over and eat.”</p>
 <p>I removed the plastic bag on the dining table and displayed the items that I had bought.</p>
 <p>The breakfast place was known for its soft bean curd with deep fried bread stick. However, I was worried the ‘young master’ wouldn’t be accustomed to this type of food. So, as a kind-hearted woman, I also bought a steamer basket of one of their most popular dishes -the mincemeat steamed dumplings that had freshly came out of the oven.</p>
 <p>“What is this?” Suyang stared at the breakfast that I had bought. His expression looked like he was staring at ET.</p>
 <p>“Breakfast! Eat!” I knew this rich guy had never eaten a commoner’s breakfast. I secretly grinned as I took out two bowls and chopsticks. I sat on the opposite side of Suyang and began to eat.</p>
 <p>As we ate, I silently glanced at Suyang to observe his expression.</p>
 <p>I had already thought of all the things that I would say to mock him if he said it wasn’t his type of meal. Unexpectedly, Suyang didn’t complain at all. He quietly ate everything that I bought.</p>
 <p>“The soft bean curd tastes better when mixed.” I reminded him.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, he lifted his hand towards me.</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>“My money. I gave you $200rmb. You only bought this stuff. What about the rest of my money?”</p>
 <p>“Hummph! So stingy!” I muttered as I jammed my hand into my pocket to take out all the leftover change.</p>
 <p>The coins clanged onto the dining table.</p>
 <p>Suyang stared at the wrinkled banknotes and I noticed blue veins appearing on his face. “Forget it, use the leftover money to prepare lunch and dinner.”</p>
 <p>Then, he lowered his head and proceeded with his meal.</p>
 <p>After breakfast, I pretended to tidy up the kitchen. But actually, I was on my phone searching up Suyang in the keywords. Strangely, there was nothing on the web about him. I was puzzled. Was he really an author?</p>
 <p>After observing him for a week, I came up with a conclusion: He was just an otaku that had nothing to do.</p>
 <p>Whenever I was tidying up around the apartment, he would be in the living room either playing video games, watching television, or playing some weird internet games.</p>
 <p>Sometimes, I would quietly watch Suyang play games. He would be very engrossed in it. Watching from the side, I would be as well. But then, he would suddenly throw the game to the side and run back to his room.</p>
 <p>“Huh? How come you don’t want to play anymore?”</p>
 <p>I stared at his closed bedroom doors. He wouldn’t come back out for the rest of the afternoon.</p>
 <p>He left me alone in the living room. But just as I decide to continue playing his game, he would suddenly come back out and ignore my bewildered expression and heartlessly pluck the electric power source and hiss at me.</p>
 <p>“I need to create right now. According to clause 35, you’re not allowed to make any noises to disturb me. No TV.”</p>
 <p>“You’re so demanding…”</p>
 <p>Suyang disregarded my complaint and went back to his room. He shut his door once again.</p>
 <p>I angrily pressed the buttons on the video game controller to release my frustrations. Ugghh. Forget it. I’m so gracious; just like one of those Prime Ministers from Ancient China that can hold a ship in their bellies...I’ll let you go this time!</p>
 <p>At this rate, if I stayed at home, Suyang was going to come out and say I was breathing too loud and tell me to stop breathing.</p>
 <p>If I can’t move at all, I might as well go out for a breath of fresh air.</p>
 <p>Since it was a work day, I was the only young person wandering the streets aside from the old uncles and aunties that were retired in the neighbourhood.</p>
 <p>Naturally, people would talk behind my back. “Wow, this young lady is always idling around…” <i>You think I want to idle?? It’s society’s fault! It is not allowing me to display my abilities. </i></p>
 <p>I came out for a breath of fresh air because Suyang was boring me to death at home. But if I wander off too far, it would be a big hassle to get back. So I took my cellphone and put some money in my pocket; I decided I was going to walk a few circles around the neighbourhood and then head to the supermarket to conveniently purchase the groceries I needed to make lunch and dinner.</p>
 <p><i>Wow, I was gradually becoming Suyang’s nanny.</i></p>
 <p>Due to my gluttonous mouth, I was carrying a huge watermelon that weighed around 4kg. In addition, the shopping bag around my arm was filled with groceries. By the time I walked out of the supermarket, I felt like my arms were going to break. All the areas of my joints were starting to turn numb.</p>
 <p>While I was shopping and placing the items into the shopping cart, I didn’t feel anything. It wasn’t until I was at the counter that I realized how much I had bought when the numbers continued to increase.</p>
 <p>Aiya, why did I buy so much?!</p>
 <p>From the supermarket, there were two paths I could take to go home. One path was the path that I took coming here. It was heavy traffic on a main street. But I would need to make a big detour before I could get back to the main entrance of my neighbourhood. The other path I could take was a nearby dark alley that was created in between the walls of houses. However, the alley would lead me straight to the entrance of my neighbourhood.</p>
 <p>The only downside was, the alley was sketchy. And according to the news, there had been an increase in crime these days. Hence, I haven’t taken this path lately.</p>
 <p>But when I saw how much stuff I was carrying, I thought about it for a bit and decided to take the alley.</p>
 <p><em>What were the chances of people committing crimes during the day?</em></p>
 <p>The moment I stood outside the alley, I felt a pang of regret. Although I was standing in a bright area, there was no light through the alley at all. The alley was long and narrow, and I couldn’t see the end of it. It was like a mysterious path to space.</p>
 <p>*Gulp*. I swallowed my saliva as I made up my mind.</p>
