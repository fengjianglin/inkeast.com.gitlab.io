 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, Ye Qingyu really hated the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, if he had not unexpectedly received a reward from the Domain Alliance, and as a result promoted to Deputy Envoy of the Human Race, allowing him to directly suppress the other side with his status, then it was most likely that the Heaven Wasteland Empire would have really suffered a huge attack under the plot of Li Wanhai. Once the four chambers of commerce had really joined forces, even if they did not use force, the Heaven Wasteland Empire would still be destroyed, and most likely unable to have a gasp of breath for at least three to five years. This to Heaven Wasteland Domain, which had been urgently enhancing its strength to protect itself, would undoubtedly be unbearable. It was important to note that it had always been soft knives that were cutting people during commercial wars. A battle without smoke would be even more terrifying than the previous domain rating assessment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was what Ye Qingyu was most worried about.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, at this moment, he may seem a bit aggressive to Fu Tianao repeatedly admitting his mistake, but in fact, he wanted to, through this tough stance, let Fu Tianao and all the people of the large chambers of commerce know that the bottom line of Heaven Wasteland Domain will always be visible, and to constantly strike and bring down the bottom line of Fu Tianao and others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More importantly, as a deputy envoy, Ye Qingyu had a lofty status and must not be angered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to the laws of the Domain Alliance, Li Wanhai's insult and attack were enough to have his whole clan slaughtered. Such laws could be said to be iron blood and not a joke. If it were the Head Envoy Ren Puyang, then Li Wanhai along with all the people of the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce that were present today would most likely have been arrested by the white-robed divine guards and killed. And Fu Tianao also would have had to bear the blame.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was unknown whether Fu Tiano was putting on a false display of friendliness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Deputy Envoy, please calm down. I only knew about this half an hour ago, and had already come right away. I did not expect Li Wanhai to be an idiot and unable to distinguish right from wrong. He did such a thing on his own initiative,” Fu Tianao sighed. “It is a huge crime to insult Deputy Envoy. From now on, Li Wanhai will no longer be part of my Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce. Deputy Envoy please feel free to do what you want. I am also willing to take responsibility for not being able to discipline him properly.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's expression grew gentler when he heard these words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as the words of Fu Tianao came out, Li Wanhai completely fell into despair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Fu Tianao in disbelief, watching the high and mighty ruler-like man who was like a Divine King in his eyes pleading and explaining in a low voice to Ye Qingyu, Li Wanhai almost collapsed on the spot. There was a biting chill bursting out from his spine, soaring straight to his head, as if to blow up the top of his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Li Wanhai's brain had suddenly become unprecedentedly clear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He finally understood what a terrible mistake he had made, and why Xie Yuyun, Zhen Shi, the chiefs of the other chambers of commerce, would kneel on the ground right away, begging for forgiveness, and even had been kneeling till now. He vaguely understood the weight of the title ‘Deputy Envoy’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a terrifying existence that even the President was afraid to provoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavens, just who did he mess with?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why was this happening?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wanhai did not dare to think more. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He still wanted to make a struggle at the end, frantically knelt down in front of Ye Qingyu, like a dog, pleading loudly, “Lord... Lord Ye Qingyu, I was wrong... I deserve to die, forgive me, Lord Ye Qingyu forgive me, I did not know about your identity, so... I was that disrespectfully, I don't dare to do it again...” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu simply ignored him, instead cast a glance at Fu Tianao. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fu Tianao immediately understood, turned his hand over and directly slammed down at the top of Li Wanhai's head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, the seven apertures of Li Wanhai's head began to bleed as he collapsed onto the ground. Li Wanhai had really angered Ye Qingyu today, and given that Fu Tianao had always ensured that what he does was flawless, he thought that Ye Qingyu most likely did not want Li Wanhai to die so easily. Therefore, with one slap, he had crippled Li Wanhai, directly shattered his vocal cords and teeth, so that he could no longer speak, and then see how Ye Qingyu would respond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu cast a glance at Fu Tianao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ruthless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the second tag that Ye Qingyu had affixed to the President of the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce after the first tag ‘know how to endure silently’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned around to take a look at Xie Yuyun and the other two, who had been kneeling on the ground all this time, and uttered, “Get up.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xie Yuyun and Li Yu both heaved a sigh of relief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They knew that the small crisis today had finally past, and it seemed that Deputy Envoy Ye Qingyu would not continue to hold their chamber of commerce accountable. The two had made up their mind that later, when they negotiate and discuss with the officials of Heaven Wasteland Empire, they must put on a sincere attitude, and they should surrender part of the profits where they could. In any case, Heaven Wasteland Domain was rich in resources and had boundless potential. Even if they did business fairly and equally, it would still be enough for the two major chambers of commerce to make a fortune.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Zhen Shi of the Engraved Cauldron Chamber of Commerce was still kneeling on the ground, kept its head low, and dared not to get up——&nbsp;</span></p>
