 <p>Those mad and berserk demonic beasts did not seem to have any plans to take a step further into the Empire.</p>
 <p>"There must be some sort of mysterious power that is controlling these killing beasts that doesn't have any intelligence!"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu shot to the sky, breaking free from the entanglement of the demonic beasts. Activating his yuan qi, he shot towards in the direction of Deer Mountain like a bolt of lightning.</p>
 <p>The distance between Deer City and Deer Mountain was only tens of kilometers.</p>
 <p>With Ye Qingyu's speed, he reached it nearly instantly.</p>
 <p>Although the mountain terrain hundreds of kilometers around Deer Mountain could not be compared to the heart of the Deer Mountain Range, but there were still many towering slopes and precipitous ledges. There were deep valleys, and clusters of wild forests. Because it was near the northern borders ,the temperature was very low. On many of the mountain peaks, there was white snow covering the very top. Only when you were in the outskirts, would you see verdant green shrubbery amongst the yellow and withered plants.</p>
 <p>From high up in the air, the main peak was like a dragon spreading out from south to north and these peaks were like the children of the dragon, encircling it.</p>
 <p>The demonic beast horde below shrouded everything.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was four or five thousands meters high in the air, above the tide of demonic beasts. Very quickly, he arrived at the most central part of the Deer Mountain Range.</p>
 <p>A large swathe of silver mist had already completely enshrouded this area.</p>
 <p>The endless demonic beast horde ran out from this area covered by silver grey mist.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu descended as he gradually neared.</p>
 <p>A terrifying aura emanated from the area covered by silver grey mist.</p>
 <p>"This is... Chaos Fog!"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was stunned.</p>
 <p>The so called Chaos Fog was a formless substance left behind when the domain was born. There was a frightening destructive power contained within it. Any power within this world could be found within the Chaos Fog. There were countless complicated strands of energy that was entangled within it that was constantly born and destroyed, born and destroyed yet again. Within the Chaos Fog, there was an awakening that was between the power of creation and destruction. Even a Bitter Sea stage expert had the possibility of perishing if they entered into the Chaos Fog.</p>
 <p>It was rumoured that when Heaven Wasteland Domain was newly born, a large proportion of its boundaries was covered by such Chaos fog.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, through the exploration of all sorts of races within Heaven Wasteland Domain, the area that the Chaos Fog covered gradually shrunk. There were many areas that were excavated so that lifeforms could exist. Currently, after the passing of several thousand years, the Chaos Fog surrounding the large majority of the continent had already disappeared. It was rumoured that there was only the existence of Chaos Fog in those legendary forbidden areas.</p>
 <p>This destructive substance was in an extremely unstable state. But because it had a destructive power that even Bitter Sea stage experts would be wary of, it was collected by some vicious people. Using secret techniques and refinement, such fog transformed into weapons that caused people’s faces to pale at the mere mention of it.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could be sure that there had never been the existence of Chaos Fog within the Deer Mountain Rang.</p>
 <p>But why would it appear right now?</p>
 <p>Staring at the Chaos Fog that was like a sea below him, he did not know what to look at.他</p>
 <p>The more he neared, the more he could sense the terrifying nature of this Chaos Fog.</p>
 <p>Within the silver grey fog, there were lights flickering like the stars, as if it was like a night sky that was covered by dim clouds. There was a complete aura of mystery around it. As Ye Qingyu stared down, he suddenly had a feeling that all his sense of direction was lost. Even if he was staring down from high up, he felt that he was staring up at the stars of the endless universe.</p>
 <p>Shreds of silver fog stretched out from within the Chaos Fog.</p>
 <p>If a shred neared and Ye Qingyu touched it slightly, he would feel a sense of pain like being sliced apart by a sharp divine weapon. He activated his yuan qi to the extreme, his silver frost yuan qi forming a one meter light barrier that prevented the Chaos Fog from touching his body.</p>
 <p>"This is troublesome. With my current strength, I have no way of passing through the area covered by the Chaos Fog..."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's brows locked together.</p>
 <p>He tried several other approaches, but there was no other path.</p>
 <p>At this time----</p>
 <p>Xiu!</p>
 <p>Another ray of light neared rapidly.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stealthily came to one side to observe.</p>
 <p>The light was like lightning that instantly came before the Chaos Fog, then stopped. It turned into two figures, one tall and one short. they both wore the attire of the sects. Ye Qingyu was still lacking in experience, so he did not understand the other sects apart from the Three School and Three Sects. Just on the basis of clothing, he had no way of discerning what sects they came from.</p>
 <p>But he could largely feel that the strength of the two was roughly equal to each other, around the forty Spirit springs.</p>
 <p>"Senior brother, we've finally arrived at the center of Deer Mountain. According to the rumours of the Jianghu, there is a treasure that is about to be born in Deer Mountain. It should be here. We were the first to receive such news, so we came early. We should just enter and try our luck, why are we stopping here?”</p>
 <p>The short person regarded his surroundings with caution.</p>
 <p>"Let's first observe a while. I still feel that our trip is filled with perils. We are not even too clear just what kind of treasure it is..." the tall person said with hesitation.</p>
 <p>The short person did not agree, arguing, "Just where is it not dangerous in Jianghu. We are quicker than other people and that means we have more chance than other people. If we just continue waiting on blindly, we will lose our opportunity. We won't have a next time... The most we'll do is die. If we really are lucky enough to obtain something, perhaps we can make the Flowing Dust Sect prosper again. If Master knew from the yellow river below, he will have a smile on his face. If the sect is strong enough, then we can protect the lives of the surrounding civilians to prevent them from suffering under the bandits."</p>
 <p>The tall person hesitated for a while. Finally, biting his teeth, he said, "Fine, we'll risk it all."</p>
 <p>After a brief period of discussion, they made their preparations. They both summoned a battle robe that was like armour and donned it. Activating their yuan power, the formation inscripted on the armour began fluctuating with light. The patterns of the formation were like little tadpoles that protected their entire body.</p>
 <p>Xiu Xiu!</p>
 <p>The two directly entered into the Chaos Fog.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu appeared from the side.</p>
 <p>"It seems those two people are not malicious people. They wanted to protect the commoners... En, but for their strength, they dared to enter into such danger, entering into the Chaos Fog?" Ye Qingyu was greatly surprised.</p>
 <p>Although the two donned armour before they entered, but one could clearly see that the black-coloured suit of armour was not any Spirit class protective garment. According to reason, it should have no way of withstanding the destructive power of the Chaos Fog.</p>
 <p>Could he have been mistaken?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu thought about it for a while and retrieved a longsword from White Horse tower. He placed the sword within the silver fog for a moment then retrieved it.</p>
 <p>The originally clear sword that was like a mirror with light fluctuating around it was like metal dipped into corrosive acid. It became speckled and degreated, like rusty metal. With a little strength, it was like rotten wood that was falling apart.</p>
 <p>There was a shred of surprise in Ye Qingyu's eyes.</p>
 <p>Although this sword was not any sort of Spirit weapon, but if the fog below was truly Chaos Fog, then the sword should completely be destroyed and turned into dust the instant it made contact with the Chaos Fog.</p>
 <p>"It seems like I was wrong. This silver fog, is not true Chaos Fog... This is really embarrassing. Thankfully, that big mouthed Wen Wan and Hon Kong is not here beside me. Otherwise, if they saw me make such a big fuss over nothing, they would definitely laugh till their teeth fell off!”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had black lines all over his head.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had obtained all he knew about Chaos Fog from the library of White Deer Academy.</p>
 <p>Although he had the ability to remember everything he saw, but things on paper were shallow, and some matters could only be realized when truly undertaking it. Without truly experiencing it, it was hard to prevent a mistake in judgement.</p>
 <p>"Woof, what are we waiting for?" The Little Nine that had always silently lay on Ye Qingyu's shoulder like a beauty dog finally could not help but be impatient anymore. It jumped about impatiently, "I smell something delicious down there, go quickly..."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded his head.</p>
 <p>Frost qi like a burning silver flame, expanded around him and enveloped him and Little Nine within it. It was as if his entire person was walking amidst flames, letting out a misty silver flame. It covered other people's gazes, preventing them from seeing his true appearance.</p>
 <p>Just when Ye Qingyu wa about to enter into the fog...</p>
 <p>Xiu Xiu!咻</p>
 <p>Another two or three rays of light flickered from far away.</p>
 <p>There were more people from the sects that had arrived.</p>
 <p>Two rays of light did not slow in the slightest, charging straight into the silver grey mist and disappearing.</p>
 <p>The third ray of light neared, then halted slightly. There was a faint appearance of a figure wearing blood red armour that appeared, smelling of rot and decay. Without even speaking, it launch an attack. A cruel and blood red blade, shot out from the hands of the figure, piercing through the sky and striking towards Ye Qingyu's direction, aiming to kill him.</p>
 <p>He evidently wanted to kill Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was enraged in his heart. The Supreme Ice Flame formed around his right hand and he grabbed the blood red blade. With the activation of the ice flame, the blood red blade instantly turned into smithereens.</p>
 <p>"Eh? It's someone tough. Fine, wait until you enter, I'll take care of you then..." The blood red figure let out a snort of disdain, talking to himself. Then it turned into a blood red light that entered into the grey mist and disappeared.</p>
 <p>"LIttle brat, if you don't want to die, then don't follow me.”</p>
 <p>HIs voice, sounded out from amongst the grey mist.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's complexion was extremely ugly to look at.</p>
 <p>He did not even know this person at all previously, but he struck to kill on their first meeting and made such a threat to him. He was evidently an expert of the sects that was vicious and merciless, and it was likely that he did many of such matters normally. From his cultivation qi and aura, the cultivation path he practiced in must be some sort of evil demonic technique.</p>
 <p>"Woof, woof. This trash. For him to so arrogant, I can't bear it anymore. Master, let's quickly enter, I'll bite him to death." The silly dog Little Nine was so indignant his body was shaking, a growl emitting from his throat.</p>
 <p>"Let's go!"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu charged into the grey mist.</p>
 <p>In an instant, killing qi-like a substance of form pressed against him from all sides. Although this mist was clearly not the Chaos Fog that was said to destroy everything, but it contained an extremely similar destructive energy. Within, there was immense pressure, as if millions of swords were stabbing into his body, or like millions bolts of lightning striking him!</p>
 <p>Even with Ye Qingyu's eyesight, he cold only see the area a hundred meters around him.</p>
 <p>He could not see any hint or trace of the people that entered before him.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu guessed at the approximate direction and continued exploring.</p>
 <p>He faintly felt that this matter was not simple. Without knowing why, the officers of the Empire seemed not to have received any news whatsoever, but the sects had such an extensive news channel. This was the news the two short and tall people had leaked out.</p>
 <p>Just what sort of treasure was within Deer Mountain?</p>
