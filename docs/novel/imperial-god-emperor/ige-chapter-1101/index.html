 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When everyone saw the Dragon Human warships charging toward the Four Stars Sect and noticed that they were led by General Xu Wuya who enjoyed considerable fame throughout the Vast Thousand Domains, they realized how intricately planned the entire punitive expedition against the Four Stars Sect had been. This plan was far beyond their expectations and they had managed to mobilize such strength that it could even be said that this was the largest battle in the Vast Thousand Domains in the past one thousand years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These Dragon Human warships stood in orderly rows and strictly followed their orders. Their battle formation was strict and imposing and this was the Dragon Teeth Army, the army that was rumored to rank amongst the top ten in terms of combat power in the current era.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Sect was a super-sect with a history of many thousand years and they had rich resources and accumulated a wealth of knowledge but the Dragon Human Race who had established the Dragonblood Dynasty were also on par with them and was also considered a major force of the current era. Although the power of the Dragon Human Race had dipped in recent years, in terms of resources, they were on par with the Four Stars Sect. Now that they had the support of the Dragon Human Race and the ten thousand White-robed Divine Guards from the Human Race headquarters on their warships, the invincible Ye Qingyu who had already killed two Quasi-emperors definitely had the upper hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't let the Black Moon Immortal Palace escape," Ye Qingyu ordered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He absolutely detested this sect and in fact, his hatred toward them was even more intense than what he felt toward the Four Stars Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His order was quickly communicated to the rest of the troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the battlefield, soldiers faced off against soldiers while generals faced generals as the massacre began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless black evil qi surged from the depths of the Four Stars Sect's gates and billowed like black clouds that could blot out the sun as it spread everywhere. Rays of evil black formations connected to form chains that surged from the spirit veins underneath every mountain peak. The shrill cries and howls of vengeful spirits could be heard from the black clouds. These figures were ugly and savage, and they were full of resentment and evil qi. They yelled loudly as they charged toward the White-robed Divine Guards and the Dragon Human army and it was obvious that this was an extremely evil dark army designed to kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Have the Four Stars Sect been grooming evil spirits?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't think so… these are probably the innocent lives that they have captured and killed over the years, and their spirits were trapped by a dark formation after their death which ultimately resulted in the formation of these evil spirits."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This was an abominably wicked technique."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Four Stars Sect ought to be punished."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, the Four Stars Sect that has built up such a righteous reputation over the past few millennia had already sunk to such evil depths without anyone realizing it. No wonder the previous Human Race spokesperson laid out the groundwork to launch a punitive expedition against them."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless experts who watched the battle unfold in the surrounding few thousand kilometers of the battlefield were both shocked and astonished. They found it hard to believe that a great sect like the Four Stars Sect had already let themselves be corrupted by the dark forces without anyone realizing it. This was definitely not a coincidence and at the thought of how the same thing could be already happening within many other sects was extremely horrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The various experts finally understood the [Ice Sword Killing God’s] efforts in ridding the Human Race of evil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had acted quickly and decisively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they had been in Ye Qingyu's position, they would probably have wavered and hesitated to attack since attacking their fellow race would attract lots of criticisms and censure from the surrounding forces and sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle was fierce and intense in the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Sect's army had retreated at the first instance and hid behind the formation of their sect gate while the White Cloud Warships and the Dragon Human warships attacked the sect gate formation incessantly. Terrifying energy waves exploded in the void and the destruction caused by the military forces was so horrific that the earth trembled and there were also light formation masters who laid out various expelling formations that unleashed vast rays of light that continued to cleanse the void from vengeful spirits that charged at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The terrifying power of the elite troops was clearly displayed in the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soldiers and White-robed Divine Guards operated like a well-oiled machine as they went on a killing rampage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Sect were forced into a corner and could only counter reactively. They caused one lone peak after another to explode and the earth trembled while the spirit veins underground already sustained some damage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The war god of the Dragon Human Race, Xu Wuya had spent his entire life on the battlefield and had also been through all kinds of battles of varying intensities. He had annihilated many sects and dynasties, so he was the perfect person to lead the battle troops. With the support of the White-robed Divine Guards, the large army slowly advanced and gradually crushed their enemy. They slowly encroached onto the sect gate's territory from the outside and moved forward one inch at a time. Their tactic was not to aim for success but to make no mistakes as they advanced, and thus they made their way forward steadily. While this tactic would take time, it slowly eroded at the rage and combat will of those at the Four Stars Sect…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time ticked by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An hour later, the Four Stars Sect had lost half their territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elite and core disciples of the sect had sought refuge in the middle of the true sect gate and pinned their hopes on the activation of the final formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, everyone could tell that the Four Stars Sect was as good as defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only a matter of time before the sect gate fell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu stood in front of the divine temple, his black hair dancing in the wind as he stood majestically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took several more Deathlike Pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The successive activation of the Geng Metal Pill and the winged swords had not only sapped him of most of his yuan qi but also left his body and spirit extremely exhausted. The Deathlike Pills would not be able to replenish everything, so he would need time to recuperate and would not be able to join in the battle. Nonetheless, based on what he could see, it was clear that victory was theirs and there was no need for him to attack at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elderly Quasi-emperor had also returned to stand by his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This elderly Quasi-emperor of the Human Race looked at Ye Qingyu strangely, clearly still shocked by how he managed to kill two Quasi-emperors single-handedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I had thought that I was bound to die on the battlefield today. I never imagined that I could have walked out of this place alive," the elderly man exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled and said, "Senior, your divine authority is matchless and as a Quasi-emperor of the current era, why would you die on the battlefield? The dust has not settled yet and we'll still need to rely on your support to hold the fort for the Human Race."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're all the Human Race needs. My presence is no longer required," the elderly Quasi-emperor said, looking very content.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After today's battle, not a single force, race, nor sect in this world would dare to oppose Ye Qingyu. He had become a legend in his own right by killing two Quasi-emperors in succession and was also now invincible throughout the world. He now had the ability to destroy any force at all and fully matured. He was now supported by the Heaven Wasteland Empire, the Human Race headquarters and the Dragon Human Race, so he would be the most powerful figure in terms of both individual prowess and the men he commanded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had accomplished what both [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] and himself had failed to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I had planned to go to the Dark Realm to witness history for myself," the elderly Quasi-emperor's eyes flashed ambitiously but soon, this fire died as he continued, "But on second thought, I gave up on this idea. I haven't got much time left, so I should return home and live out the rest of my days with my relatives and visit some friends. I have led a long life and witnessed my best friends die one at a time, I was helpless to save my beloved and also buried multiple generations of my descendants. I've already experienced all the things I should have and shouldn't have and I haven't got many friends left in the world. The person I care most about is Lu Wei – he is the most innately talented of the Lu family and I kept him sealed within an origin crystal shortly after he was born to keep him from the passage of time. I only released him from the crystal 16 years ago. My friend, I hope that you'll take good care of him."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Senior, don't worry about that," Ye Qingyu agreed with a nod.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had high expectations of Lu Wei as well. This young man might be a little stubborn and arrogant, but he could distinguish right from wrong and had a heroic spirit. Furthermore, he was the most talented young man that Ye Qingyu had come across, so after he matured, he would definitely become a great pillar of the Human Race. He was thus one of the talents that Ye Qingyu was grooming in secret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Very well," the elderly Quasi-emperor could finally rest assured that his grandson would be in good hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Ye Qingyu were to look out for him, no one in this world would be able to bully his favorite grandson who he had such high expectations of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I heard you were looking for several people but you've yet to find any clues," the elderly Quasi-emperor said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu nodded and said, "I haven't heard from some of my friends after our adventure at the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor, neither have I been able to find any traces of them at all. It is just as though they have completely vanished from this world, so I was a little worried. However, I think I've figured out where they've gone recently."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I could use my Emperor Detection Technique to help you with your mission," the elderly Quasi-emperor said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor Detection Technique was a technique that could only be mastered by Quasi-emperors and Martial Emperors. They could draw on the power of laws to make certain interferences on all living creatures and could detect their traces and this was the magical ability that Emperors had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu paused and wavered for a moment but soon, he shook his head and said, "Many thanks for the offer but I've already found out where they are."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the elderly Quasi-emperor used the Emperor Detection Technique, it would place an immense toll on his spirit and yuan qi. This would be an effortless task if he were at his prime, but the battle today had taken a lot out of his foundation and life force. He was only left with six months to live and if he were to exert the Emperor Detection Technique, he would probably be left with less than a month to live. Ye Qingyu did not want his elderly hero to waste his life force on his own personal matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Very well," the elderly Quasi-emperor nodded. "I'll get going then."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he disappeared from the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under such circumstances, he would instill more fear if he disappeared from view than if he remained where he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Quasi-emperor who lurked in the shadows would be even more advantageous to the battle than a Quasi-emperor who remained visible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an ear-splitting explosion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The earth shook and mountains trembled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The explosion caused the defensive energy shield in the void to break apart in large shards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We've broken past their defenses!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cheers rang out from the Dragon Human Race army and the White-robed Divine Guards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had broken past the Four Stars Sect's final defensive mountain formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Charge!" the War God Xu Wuya waved his war flag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His large army charged toward the Four Stars Sect's sect gate like quicksilver spilling over the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The experts who surrounded the Four Stars Sect watching the battle unfold were instantly overcome with greed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the sect gate of the Four Stars Sect and there would definitely be many treasures, secret techniques, resources, and divine weapons to be found within it. Nobody would usually even think of raiding this place, but now that the sect gate had fallen, they could use this chance to sneak in and they might even be able to find some heaven-defying treasure within the sect gate. This was a rare opportunity and would probably only happen once in a thousand years. If they could find a way to join in the battle by claiming that they want to destroy the Four Stars Sect, all these treasures could be within their reach!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Charge!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We must not lose this opportunity!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He he, this might be an internal battle between the Human Race, but we stand to gain while they are fighting it out."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What a great opportunity this is."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These figures charged toward the sect gate like rays of flowing light.&nbsp;</span></p>
