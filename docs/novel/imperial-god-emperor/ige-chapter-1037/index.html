 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The meteor fragmented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu zapped out from among the smoke and dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s going on? Could it be that His Highness [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] has been defeated?” When he was still self-isolating and recovering, he was suddenly alarmed by that earlier voice. Feeling extremely uneasy, he could not restrain his power, allowing his yuan qi to go ballistic on its own and blow up the meteor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, his yuan qi doppelganger had finally regained peak state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, because of his successive fights against the Four Stars holy girl and the [Fatally Beautiful Fairy] Jiang Xiaohan, his gains were tremendous. After all, he had always been the kind of super talent who derived improvement from endless battles. The successive encounters with fake Emperor weapons and the experience of the magnificent scene of a Quasi-emperor battle provided him with near-indescribable martial path gains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go take a look first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He flew toward the battlefield of the three Quasi-emperors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was a very dangerous place where he would perish and his Dao would dissipate as soon as he was affected, he knew very well that going there was a must.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had to lend [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] a hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, the situation would become irrevocable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the saying went, ‘no egg can remain intact when a nest is overturned’. If [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was to die, Ye Qingyu would be unable to escape the pursuit of the other Quasi-emperors even if he hid in the remotest parts of the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, the battlefield could be seen in the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Terrifying power was circulating frenziedly in an area of several hundred thousand kilometers in circumference, forming visible turbulent flows. Huge star fragments floated in the starry sky above the three Quasi-emperors, whose figures were incredibly massive and resembled ancient fiendgods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t three Quasi-emperors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instead, there were four.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A most terrible situation had arisen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The worst of Ye Qingyu's earliest predictions turned out to be true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from the three Quasi-emperors seen earlier, another giant figure who was completely wreathed by green lightning had joined the battle and ganged up with Quasi-emperor Mushan and the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor to attack [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]. Resembling a macaque, he had a red face, mirror-like eyes, and extremely long fur and horns. His body was as massive as the others’, and every move he made was accompanied by terrifying thunder and lightning. Powerful to an extreme, his body emanated an ancient aura which suggested that he was not from this age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This should be the mysterious Quasi-emperor protecting Jiang Xiaohan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only the introduction of a new Quasi-emperor could have broken the stalemate reached earlier and smashed [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]’s array of stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu began to panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The situation was extremely unfavorable and precarious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He rapidly advanced and rushed toward the battlefield while simultaneously summoning the [Cloud Top Cauldron], which thereby suspended above his head and gave off boundless Dao light to protect him from being struck and killed by the aftereffects of the battle. He felt an immense pressure as he drew near to the battlefield, as if he had fallen into a mire. Given that this was only the periphery of the battlefield, one could certainly imagine what a terrifying scene the center would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, countless thoughts raced through his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I have to help [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But how can I help?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battlefield became nearer and nearer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Visible, terrifying energy ripples pervaded the dark, deserted, and frosty Void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subjected to the tremor caused by the Quasi-emperors’ power, the power of laws of this world surged and whistled frenziedly, capable of destroying all beings within this area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kind of battle was completely beyond the limits imaginable by a martial artist. It was akin to a contention between deities and demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should’ve died four thousand years ago, Li Xiaofei. You may have held on until now but your luck has run out. Are you still not going?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his entire body shrouded in silver glow, the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor laughed thunderously. Exerting a palm, he caused a sky covering chain of silver formations to circulate. It contained terrifying imperial qi which cracked the world and shattered the Void, and was powerful enough to destroy a domain in a mere instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Resembling a divine king, [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] uttered a long and loud cry as his black hair fluttered wildly and his face revealed a dignified look. Without replying, he also exerted a palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two palms collided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dao sounds roared out while the power of laws was smashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor staggered backward, already in a defeated state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was not able to give chase. This was because Quasi-emperor Mushan and the macaque-resembling ancient Quasi-emperor simultaneously took action, conjuring boundless purple qi and green lightning to inundate him with. Laughing stentoriously, he exerted a palm which stirred up boundless winds and clouds to negate these elements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a combat method of the highest realms of martial cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For beings of this level, it was no longer a contest of battle techniques, but about returning to one’s true nature and competing using the purest form of power. For instance, a punch and a kick might look as simple as the fighting of children who had just started learning martial arts, but the power contained within was sufficient to destroy the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu cautiously drew near.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He realized that Xiaofei’s state was definitely not as perfect as it seemed on the surface. The nebulae and stars which coiled up around him were already difficult for him to maintain intact by this time, while it was apparent that his protective array had shattered. He was wounded especially on his back, where a distinct pair of giant palm marks had sunk in. A silver glow circulated within the palm marks as they emanated a mist and incessantly made ear-splitting booming and bursting noises. They were damaging Li Xiaofei’s doppelganger, as evident from the blood-like energy which poured out from their centers…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumor had it that the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor had pretended to join Li Xiaofei’s camp while in the Reincarnation Hall but would later surprise attack the latter and leave two palm marks on his back. This was why the latter was badly wounded and had fallen into a disadvantageous position. Otherwise, he certainly could not have been so embarrassed, if his cultivation which had awed the world and had been considered the best since four millennia ago was anything to go by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was astonishingly despicable of a Quasi-emperor to perform a surprise attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This explained why the Four Stars Sect and the dark [Camp] had to keep the Wei River Mountain Range surrounded in layers and prevented anyone from leaving. They clearly intended to kill all witnesses, for this matter certainly could not be spread to the outside world, which only needed to know that the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor had ultimately prevailed in this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu quickly discovered that there were not just four Quasi-emperors in this area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The many figures which he had seen on the Capital Sky Peak now appeared on the fringes of the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among them were the Four Stars holy girl and Jiang Xiaohan, both of whom seemed to have completely forgotten about their past grievances and decided to team up. Their opponents were also a duo, one of whom was the extraordinary, otherworldly [White Jade Capital] successor, who was dressed in a white fairy skirt, while the other was a black-armored burly young man whose entire body was burning with black demon qi. However, it was not the same kind of dark demon qi as that of the Greater One Spiritual Master, but… the demon qi of the Black Demon Abyss instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the Crown Prince of the Black Demon Abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having previously heard that the elder brother of the Little Princess of the Black Demon Abyss had come to the Reincarnation Hall, Ye Qingyu figured that this should be him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four young Heaven’s pridelings were fighting at close quarters on the fringes of the Quasi-emperors’ battlefield. Although their fight was not as frightening as that of the Quasi-emperors, it was also extremely fierce and dangerous, and every strike was brutal and venomous. They had evidently been at it for some time and had entered a state of fighting-till-death. The powers of the [Four Stars Sword] and the lightning cone and hammer were completely brought into play, suffusing strands and wisps of imperial qi. Meanwhile, the [White Jade Capital] successor was holding a jade piece which was as white as goat fat and was a match for the two fake Emperor weapons, obviously no ordinary item itself. The Black Demon Abyss Crown Prince was instead holding an extremely bizarre bone rod which was black and white in color and was also a fake Emperor weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who would’ve thought that these four people would actually be fighting at close quarters?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu felt a mild astonishment in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was said that the enemy of an enemy is a friend, it was nevertheless surprising that the current situation would be this complicated such that even the Four Stars holy girl and Jiang Xiaohan, each of whom wanted to kill the other not too long ago, would team up to face an enemy at this time. Who knew what would happen next? After all, betrayal was something which had already taken place many times since the descent of the Reincarnation Hall. The Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor had betrayed Li Xiaofei, while Jiang Xiaohan had betrayed the Four Stars holy girl...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu knew that the current situation was hanging by a thread and a single thought could be the difference between life and death. Therefore, he dared not be any careless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I mustn’t be gullible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And, helping the [White Jade Capital] successor and the Crown Prince of the Black Demon Race won’t be able to change the situation much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His figure flashed past the zone in which the four Heaven’s pridelings were fighting and rapidly advanced toward the center of the Quasi-emperor battlefield as planned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just then, however, the Four Stars holy girl and Jiang Xiaohan noticed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You actually dare return?” Blocking his path as soon as she could, Jiang Xiaohan said angrily, “You must be tired of living… You… get out of here quick and run as far as you can. Hide and don’t show yourself.” Her tone unexpectedly contained a tinge of concern as if she truly cared about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the latter had all along seen through her affectation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This woman is an evil spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without saying a word, he struck out with the [Blood Drinker Sword] which had appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Terrifying sword splendor cut through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Emperor sword will was worked up to the highest degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hoho, to think that you’re still concerned about your sweetheart at this time, whore. So loving of you… A pity you’re just imagining that he likes you back!” The Four Stars holy girl caught up and ridiculed Jiang Xiaohan. However, she also blocked Ye Qingyu's way, giving off endless amounts of silver glow from the [Four Stars Sword].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For some reason, she had a feeling that something bad would happen and ruin the perfect and close to succeeding plan of the Four Stars Sect if she allowed Ye Qingyu to go over to the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was involuntarily drawn into the battle zone of the four Heaven’s pridelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was unable to get away for a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another series of law shaking Dao sounds was heard, intense like no other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A new change had arisen on the Quasi-emperor battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The palm mark wounds on Li Xiaofei’s back were struck by a beam of green lightning and thus spattered flesh and blood. Staggering about in the Void, he spewed a mouthful of blood. Given that the severity of the injury on his back was originally already extremely terrible, the new infliction moreso caused huge chunks of energy to burst out until there was practically a hole through his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, he’s done for… he has been afflicted with my [Thunderbolt Curse Mark], which will kill even a true Emperor without fail!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having succeeded with his first attempt, the macaque-resembling ancient Quasi-emperor guffawed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor derived punch marks with both hands and rapidly drew near to Li Xiaofei. Without giving the latter a chance to breathe, he struck the latter mercilessly and viciously with both fists, which contained domain destroying power and were wreathed by formation chains and a brilliant splendor.</span></p>
