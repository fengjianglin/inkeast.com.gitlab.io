 <p>Chapter 342 - Is there any justice in this world?</p>
 <p>At this time, Liao Xiongyi’s family of three was completely astounded.</p>
 <p>Things were a little different to what they had initially thought.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s strong stance made the astute Liao Xiongyi immediately realized that this friend of the second son was not as simple as he had imagined... But how did his second son know such a powerful person?</p>
 <p>But the power of the Wu household was also not small.</p>
 <p>The master of the Wu household, Wu Boxiong, is the younger brother of the City Lord of Weicheng City. In addition to this, he has a close relationship with the current powerful and influential Right Minister of the Empire. No matter how impressive the young man in front was, could he be compared to the Right Minister of the Empire?</p>
 <p>Liao Xiongyi’s mind was relentlessly conflicted; he did not know what to say.</p>
 <p>His wife, on the other hand, was repeatedly expressing her thanks.</p>
 <p>Liao Cui hiddenly started at Ye Qingyu, her grip on the silver hairpin loosening slightly.</p>
 <p>She did not think too much like her father. Ye Qingyu’s appearance was like a beam of light, illuminating her dark world. As long she does not have to go to the Wu household, it was almost like a rebirth for her.</p>
 <p>Right now, all her hopes were pinned on Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>And at this time, in the surroundings of the thatched house, a number of people appeared, curiously watching the scene from a distance. Such a situation rarely happened at Donkey Tail alley, but they dared not come close. Their gaze fixed on Ye Qingyu and the other people, filled with respect.</p>
 <p>A Youyan pass soldier lit an incense stick at the doorway of the Liao family’s house.</p>
 <p>This was the deadline that Ye Qingyu set.</p>
 <p>The timer was started.</p>
 <p>The Liao family’s thatched cottage had collapsed from the fighting between Gao Shou and the strong men, and no people were allowed to enter.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu asked people to move stools and other things out from the ruins. He supported Liao Xiongyi and his wife over to sit down, and told the soldiers to help the other people whose huts had collapsed by rebuilding their huts.</p>
 <p>After all, these families were met with an unexpected misfortune because of Gao Shou’s attack. At the beginning, Ye Qingyu planned to give the poor people money, but later he thought of the scene of them being stopped by a group of men in the alley and gave up on the idea. Giving them money would only bring harm to them.</p>
 <p>The Youyan soldiers were of a profound cultivation level, and had extraordinary and endless strength. Therefore, the process of rebuilding the huts would obviously be extremely easy and fast.</p>
 <p>By the time five or six little huts were rebuilt, only three quarters of the stick of incense was burned.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Ye Qingyu was calmly chatting with Liao Xiongyi. Their conversation was about the Sentinels. When Ye Qingyu mentioned the day that the sentinels were killed, his face was darkened with shame once again and the Liao family was in tears.</p>
 <p>“My son has not defiled the glory of the emperor. He died a worthy death, which is what a soldier should do,” Liao Xiongyi said reluctantly. “At a young age, he was fond of bravery and fighting, when he was four years old he wanted to learn martial arts, so I sent him to the city’s martial arts hall... At the age of 18, he said he must enlist in the army...”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu listened quietly.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, the stick of incense had been burned completely to the bottom.</p>
 <p>At this time, at the far end of the alley, there was finally movement.</p>
 <p>There was a flurry exclamation, then the sounds of urgent footsteps, chicken flying and dog jumping, and the distant onlookers scattering away. On the tattered roof, there were dozens of figures flashing and waves of yuan qi. Skilled martial masters were heading over to the Liao family like lightning.</p>
 <p>Then there was the rattle of horse’s hooves galloping towards them.</p>
 <p>A squad of heavily armoured soldiers appeared at the end of the alley, like a powerful black torrent, rumbling over.</p>
 <p>As the chickens flew and the dogs jumped, the poor people searched for a place to hide.</p>
 <p>The crowd of onlookers, like startled mice and rabbits, instantly disappeared without trace, and withered leaves whirled chaotically in the air. The entire Donkey Tail alley suddenly sank into silence, like an uninhabited land.</p>
 <p>Except for the aggressive troops and the skilled masters.</p>
 <p>At the very front of the black torrent-like troops were one black and two white horses, and on the two white horses sat two generals in black armour, and on the middle black horse was a white-robed young man, his face as pretty as jade, with a golden hairpin and a white cape. He looked handsome, but his complexion was a little pale and there was an excessive unhealthy sullen atmosphere around him.</p>
 <p>The Jianghu skilled masters that came trampling down the roof from all directions surrounded the Liao family, Ye Qingyu and the other people.</p>
 <p>Murderous intent was filling the air.</p>
 <p>Liao Xiongyi and his family’s complexion turned paler than ever.</p>
 <p>This sort of number of people and their threatening manner made the three people’s heart pound wildly in their chest, a tide-like fear covering their hearts.</p>
 <p>Clack!Clack!Clack!</p>
 <p>The clomping of horse hooves over the gravel ground was producing sharp and clear sounds, like stepping on the heart of a man that made the heart of the people around freeze up, as if their heart had lost the ability to beat.</p>
 <p>The troops in heavy armour, holding their spear high up and shield out in front like a two meter high wall, were gradually pushing forward and closing in on them, causing a feeling of suffocation.</p>
 <p>Seeing the Liao family’s tense faces, Ye Qingyu smiled and patted Liao Xiongyi’s shoulder gently, signalling him not to be nervous.</p>
 <p>“Ah ah... young master... you came...” The housekeeper that was lying on the ground like a dead dog loudly cried. He suddenly looked alive, struggling over to the front of the white-robed man on the black horse. His teeth were knocked out, and he was speaking indistinctly as he intermittently explained the situation.</p>
 <p>“I know everything.” The white-robed youngster on the black horse was the so-called [First Young Master of Weicheng City], Wu Xi.</p>
 <p>He smiled indifferently, fanning himself with a folding fan and gently patting housekeeper Zheng’s swollen and bruised face. “Servants, come help support housekeeper Zheng over to rest.”</p>
 <p>Behind the shields, soldiers rushed out, supporting up the wailing and grumbling housekeeper Zheng.</p>
 <p>“Young master... Don’t let go of those bastards... Don’t let any one of them go.” As housekeeper Zheng was supported away, he turned his head back, a resentful and sinister look on his face, as he yelled. It was evident that he hated Ye Qingyu and the others to the extreme.</p>
 <p>On the other side.</p>
 <p>The remaining three Youyan soldiers’ expression immediately changed.</p>
 <p>How dare you insult the Marquis?</p>
 <p>Kill!</p>
 <p>Without exchanging eye contact, the three people immediately responded.</p>
 <p>The three figures, like eagles piercing the sky, rose up, shooting toward housekeeper Zheng.</p>
 <p>“How dare you!”</p>
 <p>“Stop!”</p>
 <p>The general on a white horse immediately thundered and at the same time soared into the air, the sword hanging at his waist was flashing with a cold light, preparing to intercept them.</p>
 <p>Ding!Ding!Ding!</p>
 <p>Several metallic clangs could be heard as swords continuously struck against each other in mid-air, like a torrential downpour. There were flashing sparks and figures constantly changing position. The two black-armoured generals were not weak at all.</p>
 <p>But there were three Youyan soldiers.</p>
 <p>Two of the generals respectively stopped the two people, the other one of the Youyan soldiers swooped down, like an eagle diving down fast, and swept across the head of the white-robed Wu Xi, attempting to kill Housekeeper Zheng.</p>
 <p>“Stop!”</p>
 <p>Amongst the army formation, someone yelled.</p>
 <p>Instantaneously, the forest-like spears uniformly thrust up and a cold light flashed, cutting off the Youyan soldier’s path.</p>
 <p>“Stop!”</p>
 <p>With a cold humph, a sword pierced the void.</p>
 <p>Within five meters of distance, all the tips of the steel spears, like wheat under a sickle, were instantaneously and uniformly cut off. The Youyan soldier descended like a ghost in front of housekeeper Zheng, and a bright silver sword light was reflected on housekeeper Zheng’s terrified face.</p>
 <p>“Those that insult Marquis Ye deserve to die!”</p>
 <p>The voice of the Youyan soldier fell, and the sword light was spinning.</p>
 <p>“No... spare me...” Housekeeper Zheng extremely regretted his actions. He wetted his pants in terror and there was a stench coming from his crotch, as he miserably cried for mercy. But before he could finish his words, a head flew up mid-air, and he saw his headless body trembling on the ground, blood spurting out of his chest like a fountain.</p>
 <p>Then he lost consciousness.</p>
 <p>And the two generals that were supporting him, when they finally reacted, housekeeper Zheng had became a headless corpse.</p>
 <p>The Youyan soldier’s figure flashed, returning back over to Ye Qingyu’s side.</p>
 <p>Returning with him were the two other Youyan soldiers that had intercepted the generals.</p>
 <p>The whole process was completed at lightning speed, and by the time the people around could react, Housekeeper Zheng, who was considered to be in a safe position, was already beheaded by a Youyan soldier.</p>
 <p>The two generals returned on the horseback, looking extremely embarrassed.</p>
 <p>The person even more embarrassed was was Wu Xi.</p>
 <p>He did not respond. The Wu household’s most capable housekeeper, his most trusted dog, was killed like that in front of him?</p>
 <p>This was the same as having his face slapped in public.</p>
 <p>His face was contorted with rage, looking at the skilled Jianghu master scattered across the roof, he roared, “Are you all dead? Why didn’t you stop them, did I bring you here to watch the show?”</p>
 <p>Wu Xi’s mood was very bad.</p>
 <p>During afternoon today, he had forcefully stolen a girl to satisfy his lust. In his heart, he was still remembering the girl of the Liao family when an underling came to report that there were experts who had injured Housekeeper Zheng. They had told him to come within two hours, and bring a carriage to carry the Liao family away, or they would take his life…</p>
 <p>Haha!</p>
 <p>When had Wu Xi suffered such insult in Weicheng City?</p>
 <p>Wounding Housekeeper Zheng, was that not the same as slapping Wu Xi across the face?</p>
 <p>This sort of incident, how long has it not happened in Weicheng City?</p>
 <p>Was there anyone that dares provoke him in Weicheng City?</p>
 <p>Wu Xi’s mood grew worse.</p>
 <p>When he heard from his subordinates that the other side was a rare skilled master, and he should not be too careless, not only did he bring along with him a group of Jianghu Masters, he also invited two brigades of the patrol of Weicheng City, showing an impressive display of power and influence, and hurried over to Donkey Tail alley.</p>
 <p>This time, he needed to let the entire Weicheng City know what would happen to those that provoke his people.</p>
 <p>Despite bringing so many people and exhibiting such unyielding strength and formidable superiority, not only had he not fought back for his reputation, the other side was not the slightest afraid and beheaded his own people?</p>
 <p>Is there any justice in this world?</p>
