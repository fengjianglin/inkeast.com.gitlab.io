 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A day ago, Ye Qingyu had finally destroyed the fleet belonging to Black Moon Immortal Palace, but had sustained internal injury as a result. The group of people returned from the Chaos Storm, and came to the Fire Melting City. It was Yan Wushuang who personally came forward to contact the Phoenix Race, and received approval from the Phoenix Race to stay in the Phoenix Race's encampment in Fire Melting City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As one of the super forces in the world, the Phoenix Race had an extraordinary status, and if they were stationed here, then they could avoid a lot of unnecessary trouble, as well as prevent some forces from unrelentingly attacking the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps——although such a possibility was very small.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Phoenix Race, who was thought to have a xenophobic attitude, to unexpectedly accept the Heaven wasteland diplomatic corps had caused quite a stir in Fire Melting City. Thinking back to how the Phoenix Race had openly supported Ye Qingyu and the rumours of the ambiguous relationship between the Celestial Phoenix Maiden and Ye Qingyu, many people could not help their imagination from running wild.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were some rumours that also fell into the ears of Yu Xiaoxing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in any case, as the Empress of the Heaven Wasteland Imperial Court, Yu Xiaoxing, whether in public or private, naturally had to express her gratitude to the Phoenix Race at the very first moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sitting quietly opposite her, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden just slightly nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was considered a response to Yu Xiaoxing's thanks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xiaoxing could feel a coldness from the pearl of the Phoenix Race. Of course, she also knew that this coldness was not directed at her, rather it was her personality——In fact, before meeting the peerless female Heaven's prideling, Yu Xiaoxing had already known too much information about her. One of the most important points was that the Celestial Phoenix Maiden was icy cold and often kept a distance of thousands of kilometers from other people. Based on this, Yu Xiaoxing was already well prepared and so was already extremely satisfied with the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's reaction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the problem was that, as the Empress of Heaven Wasteland Dynasty, the calm and composed Yu Xiaoxing, who did not show the slightest change of expression even when the diplomatic corps suffered heavy losses, also did not know what to say next in response.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was her who proposed to meet the Celestial Phoenix Maiden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She originally had a lot to ask and to say, but upon seeing her she was all of a sudden speechless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And on the other side, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden still remained silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the strange Phoenix mask, within those clear and cold eyes, which had made many Demon Lords and experts terrified, there was a hint of strange light, like the expression that a child has when she suddenly found out that the toy she liked already has an owner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Celestial Phoenix Maiden rarely paid attention to other matters, but yesterday, she had specifically looked through the information file on the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps. According to the information that the Phoenix Race received earlier, the woman called Yu Xiaoxing before her, was the first female Emperor to rule Heaven Wasteland Domain. Moreover, this Empress was Ye Qingyu's childhood sweetheart, and the two were publicly acknowledge as a match made in Heaven.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since they had been through a battle of life and death together in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss, Ye Qingyu's strength and character had left a deep impression on the Celestial Phoenix Maiden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a feeling of a sense of lose that even she could not understand, she was then a little curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of woman would be deeply loved by Ye Qingyu?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Driven by such a curiosity, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden was willing to postpone some important affairs for the time being, and agreed to the young Empress's request for a meeting. In the first moment of the meeting, she had already begun to observe Yu Xiaoxing carefully, which she had never done before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following that, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden did not know what to say next.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Yu Xiaoxing's cultivation, in her view, was very ordinary, but for some reason, from the young woman with red lips and bright eyes, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden saw a brilliance that vaguely dazzled her, and that was precisely what she lacked. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he likes this kind of girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a thought popped out in the mind of the Celestial Phoenix Maiden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And then unconsciously, she fell into her old habit again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was in a daze again. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since her birth, she had been declared to be a rare genius of the Phoenix Race in thousands of years. Her body flowed with the purest Phoenix Blood, and was seen as the reincarnation of a Phoenix ancestor. The Phoenix Race had poured a lot of effort and resources into her, but there was one thing about her that gave the whole Phoenix Race a headache——The Celestial Phoenix Maiden loved to be in a daze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was certainly not a serious problem, and at the beginning the Phoenix Race did not pay much attention to the issue. But then later something happened, which proved that this little problem was no small matter. After venerable elders of the race had checked through the ancient Phoenix Race scripture and verified the information, they finally came to the conclusion that the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's three Immortal souls and seven mortal forms were incomplete. She was missing one Immortal soul and one mortal form, which was why it was difficult for her to concentrate for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a huge blow to the Phoenix Race.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Celestial Phoenix Maiden was the great hope of the formation of the Phoenix Race, but if her soul was not complete, then it would be difficult for reversion and to reconstruct the remarkable power of the True God of the Phoenix.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, the Phoenix Race did not hesitate to pay a huge price to send the Celestial Phoenix Maiden into the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss, hoping to use the ancient parasol tree mentioned in the ancient Phoenix scripture to allow the Celestial Phoenix Maiden to achieve Nirvanic rebirth and to use the Nirvana Secret technique to repair her inherent deficiency and to recover her soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Nirvanic rebirth was successful, but now it seemed that the Celestial Phoenix Maiden's habit had not been completely reversed. The Phoenix Race was in a state of uneasiness and anxiety.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the moment of silence, Yu Xiaoxing suddenly recalled what happened yesterday after they were saved, and was lost in thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She in fact did not know much about the Celestial Phoenix Maiden, but had only heard Ye Qingyu briefly mention about the people and matters he encountered in the Black Demon Abyss. Yesterday, after the battle of the Chaos Storm, Ye Qingyu immediately rescued all the members, and soon they were escorted by the elders and masters of the Phoenix Race to the Phoenix Race's encampment in Fire Melting City and settled down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was now a known fact that the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps had become enemies with the Black Moon Immortal Palace as well as the forces behind them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Phoenix Race was still willing to accept them in such a situation. It was evident that her support and trust towards Ye Qingyu had gone beyond the level of ordinary friends.&nbsp;</span></p>

Now that Brother Xiaoyu had caused such a disturbance and killed so many experts of the Black Moon Immortal Palace, would there be trouble?”&nbsp;</span></p>

The Black Moon Immortal Palace has committed many misdeeds. The people who died deserved to die. Gongzi Ye had challenged the Black Moon Immortal Palace alone and had established prestige. The strength he had shown has shaken the entire nineteen cities of chaos. All attention is focused on him. According to the news that we received, there are many forces on the Road of Chaos that had acknowledged him to be a Heaven's prideling of the Human Race. He has boundless prospects. More importantly, he has the protection of the Human Race [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], nobody can touch him. You don't have to worry.” &nbsp;</span></p>

It could be said that this battle had caused a great sensation on the Road of Chaos. Not only had it sparked heated debates in the great cities, but also made many large and small forces begin to pay attention to Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
