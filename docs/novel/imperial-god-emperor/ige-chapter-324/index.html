 <p>Chapter 324 - Different Information</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?” Ye Qingyu was puzzled.</p>
 <p>He had just awakened from being deep within cultivation training. He was thoroughly immersed in practice and had forgotten about other affairs and did not know what was happening outside.</p>
 <p>“Don’t talk.”</p>
 <p>The voice of the mysterious elder sounded in his ear.</p>
 <p>The mysterious person briefly explained to Ye Qingyu what had happened, “The hearts of people are sinister in nature. The fact that you obtained this opportunity will eventually spread out, then at that time, a lot of trouble will come for you. I used Luo So’s identity to settle them for now, but you need to be careful when dealing with these people.”</p>
 <p>After Ye Qingyu listened, he understood the trouble the mysterious person had taken.</p>
 <p>He felt grateful and emotional, and immediately thanked him again.</p>
 <p>“Today’s matter has ended, I will send you all away.” The mysterious man nodded.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu said anxiously, “Elder, can you tell me your name, when will be the next time I see elder?”</p>
 <p>“We will see each other again if we are destined to, I will always watch over you.” The mysterious man smiled. “As for my name, it has long ago been buried in the dust of another time-space current, so even if I told you, you wouldn’t know.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu knew that he shouldn’t question any further.</p>
 <p>At the same time, he thought of another matter. “Senior, I have a friend, who also entered here, she’s a girl, she...”</p>
 <p>“I know who you’re talking about, that girl of darkness?” The mysterious person blurted what was on Ye Qingyu’s mind. “The girl came here as if she was returning to her own home. She just came to retrieve something that belongs to her. Once she had succeeded and to avoid affecting your opportunity, I sent her away. You don’t have to worry.”</p>
 <p>She left?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>It seems that the mysterious person had a certain understanding of Song Xiaojun.</p>
 <p>But what did he mean by Song Xiaojun came here, like she returned home?</p>
 <p>Thinking of before, when only Song Xiaojun was not suppressed by the mysterious power of the word ‘ordinary’ in the sky, Ye Qingyu knew that this girl was hiding a huge secret that he did not know of.</p>
 <p>However, no matter what, since Song Xiaojun had left, Ye Qingyu felt reassured.</p>
 <p>“Little friend, the heavens are always in motion and a man should constantly strive for perfection. You are blessed and your life is fraught with opportunity, so you must bear the brunt of danger. Death and killing will naturally follow you around. You determine using your own judgement whether something is right or wrong. Do not fall into the path of evil. Take care of yourself, we will see each other again if we are destined.”</p>
 <p>The mystery man’s words resounded perpetually in Ye Qingyu’s ear.</p>
 <p>His voice finally died away.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the stars turned and changed in position. The void began to transform.</p>
 <p>The whole world seemed to be shaking.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could only feel the starlight moving and infiltrating every corner, and his line of sight gradually became blurred, unable to capture the surrounding scenery.</p>
 <p>Once the vague feeling passed, there was a blinding flash of white in front of him, a bright light, a red sun hanging in the sky, a breeze of mountain wind, and an unbroken chain of peaks that were still white with snow.</p>
 <p>The scenery was familiar.</p>
 <p>“This is…Deer Mountain?!”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu finally reacted. In the blink of an eye, the mysterious man had used a remarkable power to directly teleport them from the [Formation Sovereign’s] moving imperial palace directly to Deer Mountain.</p>
 <p>Here was exactly the core area of Deer Mountain where the [Fog of Annihilation] appeared.</p>
 <p>The [Fog of Annihilation] had disappeared and the area that was shrouded in fog had turned to a land of death; mountain grass had withered, trees had decayed, and there were only large tracts of scorched earth, as though the god of death had been here, leaving nothing behind.</p>
 <p>The terrifying demonic beast horde had also disappeared with the fog.</p>
 <p>And in front of Ye Qingyu were the [Yin Yang Monarch], [Turtle Shell Immortal] and the other strong people, kneeling in mid-air like courtiers visiting the emperor. They did not even dared raise their head.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu knew that this was because the pressure and shock the mysterious person gave off were really too tremendous.</p>
 <p>The mysterious man borrowed the name of the [Formation Sovereign] Luo So and displayed a powerful strength that completely overawed the [Yin Yang Monarch] and the other people.</p>
 <p>“Elders, please get up. I do not deserve this,” Ye Qingyu hurriedly said.</p>
 <p>The crowd of strong people was still stunned by the mysterious man’s mystical powers. In the blink of an eye, they were transferred out of the [Base of the Formation Sovereign]. This skill could be called a technique possessed by supernatural beings. Each and every one of them was still trembling with fear, that even hearing Ye Qingyu’s words, they dared not get up and quietly waited for the [Formation Sovereign] Luo So’s command.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, his majesty Luo So had left, you needn’t wait any longer,” Ye Qingyu said aloud.</p>
 <p>The crowd raised their heads slightly and slowly.</p>
 <p>Countless respectful and surprised glances fell on Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>“Since the chosen one had spoken, everyone get up.” The [Yin Yang Monarch] was the first to get up and to open his mouth. He walked towards Ye Qingyu, bowing deeply. “Your Highness, I have sworn to follow and to assist you, if there is anything you need me to do, your Highness can just tell me.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes.” [Turtle Shell Immortal] added, “We all would like to serve your Highness, please take us with you, your Highness.”</p>
 <p>Just moments before these two men were scheming to take the treasure for themselves when they were waiting for the shrine gate to open, but after being threatened by the mysterious person using Luo So’s identity, they now put away all their thoughts and scrambled in front of Ye Qingyu. On one side, it was because Luo So’s identity was so terrifying, and in front of such a presence they felt as insignificant and small as a grain of sand in a desert before him. The other reason was because Ye Qingyu possessed the legendary and impossible 100 Spirit springs. Adding up these two pieces of information, the things they revealed were too many and too much.</p>
 <p>And one of the most direct prediction was that Ye Qingyu, as the one chosen by the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, was most likely to be the new emperor of the Human Race after the fourth dark age.</p>
 <p>If they were able to become Ye Qingyu’s subordinates, then when Ye Qingyu has successful accomplishments, wouldn’t his first followers also rise to heaven?</p>
 <p>For martial artists, such glory and seduction were far even beyond any secret technique or inheritance.</p>
 <p>So even the [Yin Yang Monarch] and the [Turtle Shell Immortal], such rebellious and ambitious people, were the first to choose to surrender and obey.</p>
 <p>“We are willing to serve your Highness.”</p>
 <p>“We are willing to listen and obey with your Highness’s commands.”</p>
 <p>The strong people declared their position one after another.</p>
 <p>Even Mo Lingfeng also made the same choice.</p>
 <p>Looking at the back of the crowd where Ximen Yeshui was lifting his eyebrows and winking, Ye Qingyu found it funny, but his expression was still calm and collected when he said, “Elders are too serious, I am just a junior who still has not travelled Jianghu. How would I dare to command elders. I just hoped that, if one day I encountered some trouble, elders could lend a hand, then I, Ye Qingyu, will already be very grateful.”</p>
 <p>“Your Highness is too serious, how could we be compared to your Highness’s priceless self.” The tone of [Yin Yang Monarch] was flattering, but he did not feel that there was anything wrong with it. “To be able to serve your Highness is the opportunity that we had always hoped for.”</p>
 <p>The others echoed his words.</p>
 <p>The majority of the people were begging to follow at Ye Qingyu’s side.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu found it difficult to refuse them. By bringing such a group of people with him, they would be incomparably imposing, especially the several Ascending Heaven stage experts. But Ye Qingyu did not want to be so high-profile. Adding to this, it seemed like [Yin Yang Monarch], [Turtle Shell Immortal] and the other people are not good and honest people and they have quite a reputation in Jianghu. If he wants to go to the imperial capital of Snow Country to investigate the truth of his father’s dying words, bringing so many people would instead be inconvenient.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu thought about it for a moment then said, “Everyone, I have other things to do, and it’s not without danger, it would be inconvenient with you, so...”</p>
 <p>[Turtle Shell Immortal] immediately grasped the meaning of Ye Qingyu’s words, he rolled his eyes and hit upon an idea, saying loudly, “I understand, since your Highness thinks so, then why don’t everyone leave our token with your Highness. We shall leave first and if your Highness has anything you need in the future, you just need to activate the token and we will rush over instantly. What does your Highness think of this idea?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu smiled and said, “Good.””</p>
 <p>Seeing his old enemy beat him first, [Yin Yang Monarch] inwardly scolded himself for being stupid, but he was not slow to take out a black and white fish-shaped token and respectfully handing over to Ye Qingyu. “Your Highness, this is the Yin and Yang Divine Token, it is the supreme token of my [Yin and Yang Path], seeing this token is the same as receiving the orders from the elders. You will be able to command all disciples of the [Yin and Yang Path].”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded and made no further refusal, directly accepting it.</p>
 <p>The [Turtle Shell Immortal] took out a dark green tortoise shell that was the size of a palm and respectfully presented it over. “Your Highness, this is my [Turtle Deity Island’s] most valuable treasure, able to command all disciples of [Turtle Deity Island] If you instill yuan qi, then it can also turn into a giant shield and defend against attacks...”</p>
 <p>Other people also offered their own tokens one after another.</p>
 <p>“Thank you everyone. If I trouble you in the future, then please don’t be offended.” Ye Qingyu received all the tokens, smiled and gave a cupped fist salute.</p>
 <p>“We all are willing to sacrifice our life in the service of your Highness.”</p>
 <p>“Your Highness speaks too seriously.”</p>
 <p>“Your Highness is too polite.”</p>
 <p>After some polite words, the [Yin Yang Monarch] and the other people said goodbye and left.</p>
 <p>Soon there were only Ximen Yeshui and Qin Zhishui.</p>
 <p>“Hey, hey, my brother, you’ve really struck it big this time,” Ximen Yeshui said, grinning and holding up the three-pronged spear in his hand. “How about you also accept my spear weapon too.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu glared at him. “Your fish spear is too tattered, I don’t want it.”</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui chuckled, “You have no appreciation for something good. My weapon has an impressive story, you will regret it if you don’t accept it.”</p>
 <p>On the other side, a strange expression moved over Qin Yeshui’s face. He was about to say something, when Ye Qingyu hurriedly waved. “Brother Qin no need to be polite. You and I are friends, so don’t imitate those people.”</p>
 <p>With his mouth wide open, Qin Zhishui could only nod his head.</p>
