 <p>Chapter 314 - The Other Shore</p>
 <p>Everyone’s heart jumped up when they looked in the direction his finger pointed at. On the blood red ocean surface there seemed to be something floating over in the distance.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go take a look,” Ximen Yeshui said curiously.</p>
 <p>The boat rowed closer.</p>
 <p>As they neared, everyone saw clearly that floating in the ocean was a half corpse of a person.</p>
 <p>What remained was the lower half of his body. The blood red water had eroded the clothes and mottled copper armour was covering the important areas. But what shocked them the most was that this half of a body that was found soaking in the blood water had not corroded yet, and the skin and pores were clearly visible...</p>
 <p>“Look at that foot...”</p>
 <p>The armoured old man suddenly pointed to the right foot of the corpse.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked down at his right foot that only has three toes. It seems that his toes were not chopped off, but he was born with three toes.</p>
 <p>“Could it be Mo Lingfeng?” Qin Zhishui, inwardly shocked, could not help but speak out.</p>
 <p>Mo Lingfeng?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was taken aback.</p>
 <p>The armoured old man carefully examined the body before letting out a long sigh, “This little brother is right, it is indeed the remains of senior Mo Lingfeng... I saw Senior Mo Lingfeng enter the shrine gate before us. He possesses an earth-shattering cultivation level. A hundred years ago he was already an expert of the Bitter Sea stage. He has many accomplishments in his life, how... did he die here? What happened?”</p>
 <p>“How do you know him so well?” Ye Qingyu asked in a surprised tone. “What if you’re mistaken?”</p>
 <p>The armoured old man cast a glance at him. “I won’t be wrong. A while ago I had the privilege of meeting Senior Mo, Senior Mo was born with a deformed right foot.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t there a rumor around that Senior Mo Lingfeng had entered the Bitter Sea stage a hundred years ago and may have reached the Heaven Ascension level by now?” Qin Zhishi was more talkative now.</p>
 <p>“It’s not a rumour, he has indeed entered the Heaven Ascension state,” Ximen Yeshui said firmly. “Fifty years ago, the old man came to my master’s door and I met him. At that time, he was already at the level of ascending heaven. He has a profound cultivation, but is also a good person, unfortunately he died here... The Heaven Ascension state is known as a completely different state and level. It seems that only the people of the Ascending Heaven state can withstand the corrosive power of the blood red sea.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could not help but cast a surprised glance at Ximen Yeshui.</p>
 <p>This dark and reckless scholar’s master really had an extraordinary background.</p>
 <p>“Even an Ascending Heaven state has died here...” The middle-aged swordsman’s face was coloured with despair.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stretched out the oar and took the half body out of the blood red water.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?” the middle-aged swordsman shouted.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked at him, saying faintly, “Since he is my senior, I cannot let his body drift about and be humiliated. Of course I have to take his body back to bury.”</p>
 <p>“Little brother is right, we were negligent.” The armoured old man’s eyes had a glimmer of appreciation when he looked at Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>“Humph, who knows what is on his mind,” the middle-aged swordsman said coldly. “Maybe he is eyeing up the treasures on Mo Lingfeng. That piece of copper armour that did not corrode even in the blood red water must be a valuable treasure...”</p>
 <p>“Shut up. Do you think everyone is as despicable as you?” Ximen Yeshui stood up all of a sudden. “I dare you to say another word.”</p>
 <p>The middle-aged swordsman immediately and resentfully shut up.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu paid no attention to him. He fished up the half of the corpse and after a little cleaning, stored it in the interdimensional pouch with the other corpses.</p>
 <p>“Since the body of Senior Mo appeared here, it shows that we are heading in the right direction. There is no mistake, the people that entered the shrine gate before us must have also gone straight ahead on a boat, just that an accident happened...” Ye Qingyu stated.</p>
 <p>“That’s right.” The armoured old man nodded. “Now that we have come here, we should accept it. There is no way out. No matter what happened in front, we have to take a look.”</p>
 <p>The group of people had a short discussion before continuing on.</p>
 <p>It was just that everybody’s heart was getting heavy.</p>
 <p>A day and a night had already passed.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, all the people here were of a profound level of cultivation, possessed extraordinary strength, and did not feel tired. The boat sped along without stopping for any rest.</p>
 <p>At this time, Ximen Yeshui, who has been standing at the bow looking around, suddenly exclaimed.</p>
 <p>“Ah, in front... it’s like... there’s something.” He pointed at a distant place.</p>
 <p>Everybody tensed up.</p>
 <p>The armoured old man jumped to the bow, carefully looked around, before he suddenly excitedly cheered. “It’s the other shore, I see the other side of the shore, we have arrived...”</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>“It wouldn’t be a mirage, right?”</p>
 <p>Almost all the people were jumping in excitement.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stood up and looked ahead.</p>
 <p>Indeed, faintly but visibly, the distant seawater was becoming shallower and mountains were coming into view, dotted with faint shades of green. It seemed that on the coastal land, there was plant growth.</p>
 <p>“Quick, paddle over there, hahaha...” The middle-aged man laughed, unable to contain his excitement.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s face glowed with excitement and their enthusiasm was rekindled.</p>
 <p>They had reached the shore.</p>
 <p>[Formation Emperor] Luoso’s legacy was right in front of them.</p>
 <p>But at this time——</p>
 <p>“Bad!” The armoured old man suddenly screamed, pointing below. “Boat... there’s a leak... this... what’s going on?”</p>
 <p>Everyone looked down and immediately, their bodies tensed up.</p>
 <p>It was unknown when but blood red water had seeped into the cabin. The boat was already very small, and although the water was not much, but with the crowd trying to avoid the blood water from staining their body, the boat suddenly appeared very crowded.</p>
 <p>“Hurry up and paddle, hurry up and paddle... What are you doing staring blankly?”</p>
 <p>The middle-aged swordsman screamed in panic, pointing and cursing at Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>At this point, the distance from the shoreline was at least dozens of miles. In normal times, everyone could have crossed such a distance in the blink of an eye, but now they were lacking in yuan qi. By simply relying on strength, they could not leap as far as before. The shadow of death made everyone tensed up.</p>
 <p>“What the hell are you saying...” Ximen Yeshui clasped his three-pronged spear. His face grew stern and cold.</p>
 <p>“No, no... I mean, hurry paddle the boat or everybody’s going to be done for,” the middle-aged swordsman said, cowering.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu also did not speak. He swung the paddle back and forth, and in coordination with the armoured old man, the boat, like an arrow released from a bow, darted towards the shoreline.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s heart was in their throat.</p>
 <p>There were constantly fresh red water seeping in.</p>
 <p>“At this rate, before we reach the other shore, we would sink into the water and be killed...” the middle-aged swordsman mumbled to himself, his face ashen.</p>
 <p>The people on board stood up and huddled together.</p>
 <p>No one could stand at the cabin area anymore.</p>
 <p>Seawater continued to seep in.</p>
 <p>“No, our boat is too heavy... Too heavy, must think of a way...” the middle-aged swordsman shouted.</p>
 <p>“Then what? Why don’t you jump down and lighten the weight of the boat?” Ximen Yeshui said with a cold smile.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged swordsman dared not answer, his eyes swept around the circle of people, and finally fell on Qin Zhishui when a fierce smile curved his lips. “You are by yourself, right? You’re, too heavy, jump off.”</p>
 <p>Qin Zhishui’s complexion was calm, clasping the red silk hilt of his blade firmly.</p>
 <p>“What, you want to fight?” Eagle hook nose snorted. “Here you have no companion. Obediently roll down and we can leave your corpse intact. Otherwise, I will tear you to shreds and you won’t be able to beg for your death.”</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>The middle-aged swordsman clasped his sword and walked towards him threateningly.</p>
 <p>Just then——</p>
 <p>“Who says he has no companions, we are together.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu who was swiftly rowing the boat suddenly opened his mouth and said calmly.</p>
 <p>“You...” The middle-aged swordsman looked startled for a moment, then suddenly a scowl of rage was upon his face.</p>
 <p>Eagle hook nose growled, “Kid, the only reason you can safely stay on this boat is because of the power of others. Do not meddle so much, be satisfy with what you have.”</p>
 <p>While paddling the boat Ye Qingyu smiled a cold smile. “This is what I wanted to say to you two. Brother Ximen and I, as well at that beautiful lady there, can sweep away you two scum at the snap of our fingers. We let you sit all the way here, you should be content. If you’re that discontent and think the boat would sink, you might as well jump off yourselves.”</p>
 <p>“You... who do you think you are, you....” the middle-aged swordsman yelled.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui humph coldly, pointing the three-pronged spear at him.</p>
 <p>In the middle of Song Xiaojun’s palm, a dark flame also faintly emerged.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged swordsman instantly shut up.</p>
 <p>“Crazy, all crazy...” The eagle hooked nose grumbled through gritted teeth.</p>
 <p>Qin Zhishui stared blankly for a moment then looked strangely at Ye Qingyu. He did not expect Ye Qingyu to help him, but he still nodded and gave a cupped fist salute, as though saying that he will remember this favour.</p>
 <p>As they talked, the level of blood red sea water that seeped into the boat was already as deep as the palm of their hands.</p>
 <p>“No, this boat is not going to hold...” the armoured old man said in a disappointed tone. “Everyone, you are on your own, good luck!”</p>
 <p>At this point, the distance from the shore was more than 2000 meters.</p>
 <p>Once he finished his words, he leaped up, jumping over the blood red sea.</p>
 <p>The crowd gaped in shock.</p>
 <p>The next moment, as the armoured old man was about to fall into the water, he suddenly struck the blood water with the oar in his hand, using the force to bounce back up again and leaping over a distance of nearly hundreds of meters...</p>
 <p>After a few times, he had jumped over thousands of meters.</p>
 <p>“Yes, the oars are not afraid of the blood water, we can borrow its force...This old thing is too cunning... crafty old fox, he has a kind old face but in fact, had already planned this, he managed to escape himself...”</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui stared with his eyes fixed and his mouth wide-open.</p>
