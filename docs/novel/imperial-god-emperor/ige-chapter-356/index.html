 <p>356 - Rematch, [Shadow]</p>
 <p>Because Ye Qingyu had no way of confirming whether the other young experts had discovered this, he had no way of confirming whether the technique Bao Shinu possessed was not complete, or he had intentionally hidden away the true heart of this technique. Therefore, Ye Qingyu did not raise this point.</p>
 <p>But he constantly attempted to use the nameless breathing technique along with the [Dragon Fist] sutra. He was incomparably shocked to discover that, under his activation, the nine moves of the [Dragon Fist] were able to reach a mysterious perfect state. It caused him to feel extremely comfortable, as if he was floating in the air.</p>
 <p>There were nine gaps and weaknesses that originally existed, but they had completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>When he discovered this, it was something unexpected, but it seemed to be reasonable.</p>
 <p>Previously, he had already experienced the specialness of this nameless breathing technique fully. That ancient existence that had pretended to be the [Formation Sovereign] Luo So, had once called this nameless breathing technique peerless. Furthermore, Ye Qingyu had also used the nameless breathing technique to activate other cultivation techniques before. The effects of doing such a thing had always been better than using the original breathing techniques.</p>
 <p>On the arena, he had beaten [Shadow] and [Avalanche] namely because of this.</p>
 <p>This had affirmed Ye Qingyu's resolve to use the nameless breathing technique to activate the [Dragon Fist] sutra.</p>
 <p>But right now, he should do something else.</p>
 <p>Slowly activating the nameless breathing technique, faint white mist began spreading about. It covered and enveloped Ye Qingyu's entire person as well as the stone bed below him. From outside, they could only see a silver mist and had no way of seeing what Ye Qingyu was doing on the bed.</p>
 <p>Being careful of the eyes around him, Ye Qingyu took out the [Human King Sword Mantra].</p>
 <p>This was what Dugu Quan had complimented as one of the three peerless sword mantras of Heaven Wasteland. Just what sort of mystery was hidden within this sword mantra?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was expectant.</p>
 <p>He slowly opened to the first page of the sword mantra.</p>
 <p>A swathe of small characters the size of flies met him.</p>
 <p>Sword, the sacred item of the ancients. Respected and noble, it is worshipped by humans and deities. It is the ancestor of all weapons, the tool for killing. Deep into one's path, one can enter the Dao. Lightweight and convenient, vigorous, striking fast and nimble. A Divine weapon. The way of the sword. The first is Human, the second Deity, the third is Heaven. The sword of the Human King cannot be defeated by human. The sword of the Divine Emperor cannot be defeated by Fiendgods. The sword of Heavens is Life. The existence of the world is life. The way is split into Yin and Yang, life goes through living and dying. Life is neither dying nor living. If life and death does not exist, the way does not exist. This is the law. Without the way, there is no domain. Without domain, there is nothing. With the way, there is domain. Only with domain can sword exceed all!”</p>
 <p>This paragraph was the introduction of the [Human King Sword Mantra].</p>
 <p>After Ye Qingyu finished reading it, he felt as if knowledge was being forced through his head. It was as if he was amidst the clouds.</p>
 <p>Such an introduction placed reverence for the sword arts to the extreme.</p>
 <p>If he did not guess wrong, Ye Qingyu felt this paragraph was not only the introduction of the [Human King Sword Mantra], but it was also the introduction of the Human King, the Divine Emperor as well as the Life Sword Mantra. If the unmatched War God described by Dugu Quan had really cultivated such sword arts to the realm described by this introduction, then even in the nine heavens, the ten earths, and the three thousand domains, there would be no one who would be his opponent.</p>
 <p>After reading to here, Ye Qingyu could not but give his respect. He became much more serious.</p>
 <p>He placed the mantra on the bed, then respectfully bowed in front of it. After giving it the ceremony it deserved, he used the power of the [Supreme Ice Flame] to wash his hands then once again held the [Human King Sword Mantra] to have a more careful look.</p>
 <p>Time passed slowly.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked as if he was mad or drunk, forgetting everything around him.</p>
 <p>Only after eight hours did he suddenly awaken.</p>
 <p>"To think that the [Human King Sword Mantra] does not have any sword moves..."</p>
 <p>He was dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>This sword mantra described thousands of moves of the sword arts. Hack, chop, collapse, hinder, raise, cut, thrust, disturb, wash, press, hang, sweep and so on. It spoke about how it was flexible yet firm, and can take in and thrust out not being constrained by anything, nimble and effortless. Ultimately, it became just a sentence---</p>
 <p>"It can be understood but not described!“</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could not laugh or cry.</p>
 <p>Just what sort of mantra was this, it seemed to be just fabrication. If not for the fact that he had heard Dugu Quan mentioning such secrets, Ye Qingyu would really have believed that the [Human King Sword Mantra] in his hands was the prank of someone. Just what sort of mantra was this? It did not mention breathing techniques, it did not mention martial moves, it did not mention the process of cultivation, but only mentioned the ultimate result?</p>
 <p>Thankfully, the [Human King Sword Mantra] had lastly mentioned that as long as he reached a state that his sword would move with his will, and the feeling that his sword was unstoppable, then he would have succeeded.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
 <p>Just what sort of secret mantra was this.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could only go back from the beginning and slowly mull over the meaning of the words. He tried to understand phrase from phrase. He attempted to discern some cultivation techniques from these obscure and vague worlds. Perhaps such an incredible sword mantra was not simple, and there was a secret hidden within.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>In the next few days, everyone madly trained.</p>
 <p>After receiving the most suitable weapon and the most perfect cultivation techniques, this was unquestionably the best thing in this entire world. Furthermore, there were unending sources of herbs, pills and Origin crystal, cultivation resources. Such things were even better and more excellent than those given to noble children of many high noble families.</p>
 <p>They were all from a poor background and had struggled on the line between life and death. They all had a heart that yeared towards the martial arts, and everyone madly trained, racing against time.</p>
 <p>Bao Shinu as well as that battle technique instructor would appear for a period of time everyday. But they would not give advice of their own initiative. Only when someone asked would they demonstrate to solve their queries.</p>
 <p>Between the young experts, there were no more incidents where they sparred or challenged with each other.</p>
 <p>Everyone was clear just how important this period of time was.</p>
 <p>It was only that every time the black-robed young man, [Shadow], saw Ye Qingyu, he would let out a cold snort. There was still a fierce will to do battle burning in his eyes----in truth, it was not only just [Shadow]. Every young expert, when they saw Ye Qingyu, would have a fierce desire to fight. But it was only that everyone suppressed such an urge.</p>
 <p>Because everyone understood, the current them, had no chance of defeating [War God].</p>
 <p>The scene that appeared on the training hall which showed the rankings of the young experts, constantly changed although the extent to which it changed was not large. The rankings would move up and down by three or four places. The only reason it changed was the observation and judgement of several Bitter Sea stage instructors, as well as the results of some formations that tested their strength.</p>
 <p>Even the ranking of [Shadow] had been exceeded by [Heavenly Projectile] once or twice.</p>
 <p>As for the title [War God], it had always remained in number one. It had never changed.</p>
 <p>Of course, the person that was titled [Normal Person] had always remained last. This had also never changed.</p>
 <p>Everyday was training, training and more training.</p>
 <p>The young experts seemed to have turned mute. Without the need, they would rarely speak. In the training camp, apart from the sound of weapon striking weapon, there were no other noises.</p>
 <p>Every one of them had driven eyes. Either they were sitting in a meditative position on their own stone beds for an entire day, or they would train for an entire day in front of the formation machinery.</p>
 <p>Time seemed to have lost it's meaning.</p>
 <p>Such a situation continued until the tenth day.</p>
 <p>"[War God], I challenge you."</p>
 <p>The black-robed young man, [Shadow], had red eyes, as if he was a wild, crazed beast. There was a mad killing aura encircling around his body. He came before Ye Qingyu's stone bed, his voice hoarse, as if he was about to go into a frenzy.</p>
 <p>From [Shadow]'s body, he could sniff an extremely dangerous aura.</p>
 <p>Such danger did not represent that [Shadow] had suddenly become much stronger. It was that the aura within [Shadow]'s body was at the borderline of explosion. Evidently, he had forcefully trained in some sort of cultivation technique. If one spoke commonly, he had signs of falling into demonic disruption.</p>
 <p>"Do you dare accept battle?" The voice of [Shadow] was like two pieces of metal grating against each other.</p>
 <p>Such an action attracted the attention of everyone around them.</p>
 <p>Everyone came to have a look.</p>
 <p>It had finally arrived.</p>
 <p>Such a day had finally arrived.</p>
 <p>There was finally someone that willing to challenge [War God] again?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu slowly stood up, nodding his head. "Fine."</p>
 <p>Before he had finished.</p>
 <p>The figures flickered.</p>
 <p>[Shadow] had already appeared on the outside arena.</p>
 <p>What also appeared on the arena at the same time was Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Xiu!</p>
 <p>A bolt of black lightning shot from the waist of [Shadow] to Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Without wasting any words, battle instantly begun.</p>
 <p>Such a black lightning, was namely the newly acquired weapon of [Shadow]. This black supple sword that could enwrap around his waist was like the nimble tongue of the sword. It was like lightning, extremely fast.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not unsheathe the sword [Beheading Wind]</p>
 <p>He took a step aside, lowering his waist and striking out with his fist. Accompanied by the roar of dragons all around, a fist struct against the body of the black-coloured soft sword.</p>
 <p>Clang!</p>
 <p>The sound of metal clashing sounded.</p>
 <p>The black-coloured sword was like a shocked little snake flickering about. but the sword move was not broken. One turned to two, two turned to four, four to eight, eight into the infinite. The black shadow that enveloped the sky was like the tongues of a poisonous snakes that was accompanied by the sound of air being pierced through. It headed bitingly towards Ye Qingyu's body.</p>
 <p>A faint cold shadow power began to be exhibited within the sword moves.</p>
 <p>"So this [Shadow] is the same as Jin Ling'er. He is also a martial expert with the shadow attribute.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu instantly made a judgement about the martial cultivation specialities of [Shadow].</p>
 <p>He still lowered his waist, the nameless breathing technique activated. The first move of the [Dragon Fist], second, and third unendingly struck out. The action was not urgent or slow, and seemed to be filled with a strange rhythm. The cold aura exploded, and the power of the fist rebounded, letting out a light that was filled with a serious aura.</p>
 <p>Countless sword glimmers were struck backwards or to the side by the power of that fist. It completely had no way of nearing within three inches of Ye Qingyu.</p>
