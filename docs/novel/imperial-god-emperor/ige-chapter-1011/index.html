 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperor Mushan gave a faint smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No wonder, when my younger brother was killed, I had tried to sense the scene of the killing, but my perception was obstructed by some sort of powerful ability. It is difficult for a junior to do this. Previously, I thought that it was his ancient Emperor weapon that blocked the mystery known only to the heavens, but it turns out that there is unexpectedly still a mighty figure behind him. Just now this human junior would rather die than to retreat, in order to guard you, to act as your protection. It is indeed a rare scene.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Understanding dawned on his face when he saw the hairless strange person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your brother brought about his own death, you can't blame other people,” the hairless jaded person stated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was naturally the million-year-soul who had finally refined the Immortal body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that his present state was a little strange. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperor Mushan nodded, “I know what he did had brought about his death, but so what?” He was a Quasi-emperor, and who kills by the heart. Even if Ye Qingyu had not killed his brother, he still did not need a reason to kill Ye Qingyu. When did a Quasi-emperor need to explain to others what they do? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After you.” The million-year-old soul smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no need to say anything more. A battle could solve everything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperor Mushan took a step forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this step, terrifying imposing manner surged violently. The weight of the whole world seemed to be behind him, and the power of the law was sent roaming around. The Void was similar to an undercurrent swamp, tumbling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-year-old soul burst into loud laughter, also taking one step forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He opened his mouth and inhaled, generating a deep black hole in his mouth, and sending the surrounding rays of light and Void into distortion. His mouth seemed like it could devour all things, including the laws and aura released by Quasi-emperor Mushan. Like a whale drawing in water, everything was inhaled into his mouth. Then, the [Dragon Palace] ruins suddenly restored calmness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“[Finger of Annihilation]!” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperor Mushan maintained an indifferent face. He knew that it was naturally impossible to defeat the opponent with one step. With a thundering noise coming from his mouth, he pointed towards the distant Void.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was different from the previous move he used against Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, it was not the index finger, but the thumb.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Void, the space was sunken in. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the press of a finger, a transparent fingerprint of hundreds of meters was instantly generated. The fingerprint was distinct, lifelike, and the arches, loops and whorls on the finger were clearly visible like mountains and rivers. The entire fingerprint was flowing with numerous hidden formation markings as it directly pressed down from a height of hundreds of meters. What was bizarre was that, this fingerprint did not contain any power, nor was there any ripples or waves; it was floating like an illusory bubble. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Neither one thing nor the other... have you only learned some superficial knowledge of the [Great Ten Veins of Annihilation Sutra]?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-year-old soul had a look of disappointment across his face, standing where he was he opened his mouth and drew a deep breath again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As before, like a whale sucking in water, he directly inhaled the huge fingerprint, which formed into a bright speck of starlight and swallowed into his mouth. His cheeks puffed up, and his face flushed a red colour. The next moment, a ball of bright silvery light was seen moving along his mouth, throat, and organs and eventually spread to the dantian location, disappearing immediately. Then, everything returned to normal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How do you know about the [Great Ten Veins of Annihilation Sutra]?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperor Mushan revealed a look of surprise. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He clearly felt that the naked jade-like strange person had not reached the boundary of Quasi-emperor, yet his body was like a bottomless black hole, able to absorb and contain everything. Adding to this, his opponent was able to identify his own martial arts background and that he had inadvertently received the handed-down techniques of the race of the Void. After becoming a Quasi-emperor there had been no other person that was able to see through his background and inheritance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is nothing in the world that I do not know.” The million-year-old souls tone spoke in an arrogant tone of voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperor Mushan's face grew solemn.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his eyes, there were gradually violet divine light accumulating, evolving into stars, starry rivers, and purple clouds. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This pair of eyes seemed to be able to see through all the mysteries of the world. Heavenly sounds were rumbling in the Void, and the might and power of a Quasi-emperor pervaded the air. “You exude an ancient qi, your life force is destroyed, and should have died long ago. But you're still on the line between life and death, as though sprouted from rotten corpses. You’re a life of nothingness and should not exist in the present. You... could it be that you are a soul who crawled out of the grave and was reborn?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, your [Violet Eye of Great Annihilation] is still a distance away from the realm of understanding the heaven and man, and you do not understand the handed-down techniques of the Void. How can you see through my origin?” The million-year-old soul laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An invisible force gushed from his laughter, which as before, was a terrifying suction force, pulling all the crystal fragments of the [Dragon Palace] ruins towards him. Amid the whizzing noises, countless crystals shrouded him, forming into a crystal armour, and he was no longer naked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperor Mushan, whose heart was as firm as a rock, was unshaken and simply gave a slight smile in response. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A verbal battle is not beneficial, take my [Sunset Mountain... Violet!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before his voice faded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two violet dragons burst out from his eyes, howling, coiling, and fusing into one, like two divine dragons emerging from an abyss, like two dragons playing with a pearl. The great power of annihilation it contained was aimed at the million-year-old soul. The violet colour dyed the Void completely. His power and laws, like a star exploding in the Void, were unbelievably strong, forcibly taking away all the brilliance of the world. It was unknown how many times more powerful it was compared to his attack against Ye Qingyu's [Blood Drinker Sword Pil].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was evident that the Quasi-emperor did not exert all his strength when he dealt with Ye Qingyu's killing move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Back then, golden swords and iron horses gulped ten thousand kilometerslike tigers!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-year-old soul stood up straight and tall as he recited a verse of a poem, seeming to have restored to his peak state of the past. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind him was the image of a very powerful army, like a scene of the past had transcended time and space. There were thousands of kilometers of mountains and rivers stained blood-red, hundreds of armour-clad generals, and among them was a tremendous white tiger of over one thousand meters treading across the bone battlefield. As though suddenly awakened, he suddenly looked up and roared, opening his mouth to swallow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Battle between the dragon and tiger!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white tiger against the violet dragon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperor Mushan was shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white tiger leapt up, its claws clutching the violet dragon, and its mouth widened to swallow it into its stomach.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a battle between Quasi-emperors, extraordinary sights were the same as luck. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The result of the battle of extraordinary sights was the outcome of the exchange of blows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this exchange of blows, he had lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, the million-year-old soul opened his mouth to swallow the violet-eyed dragon exactly the same as the way the [Finger of Annihilation] was swallowed. The million-year-old soul’s head expanded, cheeks puffed up, and his muscles bulged. This was especially so for the cheeks, it was like a toad that had both its cheeks bulging with air, his skin becoming translucent like paper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was exactly the same as when he swallowed the [Finger of Annihilation]. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But obviously the power of devouring this time was much more magnificent than before. The face of the million-year-old soul was constantly changing between four different colours, red, orange, blue, violet, seeming to be transforming, digesting and swallowing the forces. Eventually all the power had transformed into a ball of blinding violet light. It was unknown how many times more dazzling it was than the previous silver light. Then, it traveled down his throat, neck, chest and to the dantian position, and eventually disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the body of the million-year-old soul grew more and more majestic. An invisible charm was diffusing out of his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His aura was also quietly changing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of secret technique was this?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperor Mushan looked aghast. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stared at the million-year-old soul, making some guesses in his mind. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The techniques that the million-year-old soul had shown were too bizarre. Even at this time, Quasi-emperor Mushan still could not perceive the true power of the million-year-old soul. He only knew that the person before him was like a black hole, unfathomable, bottomless, and no matter what force or object would be engulfed by this black hole, crumbled and vanished. Even someone as powerful as Quasi-emperor Mushan had failed to see through the opponent’s technique and martial arts background after three consecutive moves. It was a very bad sign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More importantly, the million-year-old soul had only been defending and had not fought back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he were to attack then how earth shattering would it be?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What made Quasi-emperor Mushan more bewildered was that the opponent was able to identify his background right away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Didn't you say? There is ancient qi exuding from my body. I am like a sprout grown from rotting corpse... Since ancient times, who can reincarnate from a rotting corpse? And here, where is this place?” The million year-old soul smiled. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body all of a sudden changed dramatically.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strands of black hair wildly grew from his smooth white jade-like baldhead like vines, hanging over his shoulder and down to the waist. Every strand of hair was flowing a healthy glow, like leaping black flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only that, brows and a beard also grew out almost in an instant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His brows were like swords, forehead plump, eyes bright like stars, nose straight, cheeks round, and his ears were thick and wide...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The uncomfortable feeling that his original appearance gave, after the growth of hair and brows, had immediately disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the million-year-old soul, clad in crystal armor, was extremely handsome. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His skin resembled white jade Immortal stone, without the slightest flaw, and even the most beautiful woman in the world would feel jealous. Every inch and every part of his whole body was perfect. It was as though the creator had given the best things in the world to his body. This perfection made him look not like a living being, but a carefully carved piece of art.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he laughed, there was a demonic charm to his face, and vaguely there was a mysterious and unfathomable demonic aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This demonic aura was identical to the demonic qi that was everywhere in the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You... it's you...” Quasi-emperor Mushan suddenly seemed to understand something, and cried out in disbelief, “Growing a sprout out of death is a skill of reincarnation... you are the Chaos Demon Emperor? You... could it... &nbsp;you have finally finished your one hundreth reincarnation? Heavens!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor, whose heart was as firm as a rock, also couldn’t help exclaiming uncontrollably——&nbsp;</span></p>
