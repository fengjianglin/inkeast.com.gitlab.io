 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Sect took a hardline stance and it was obvious that they would battle Ye Qingyu head-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one was surprised by their reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment this situation intensified, there was no party who was absolutely right, and the Four Stars Sect was definitely not about to initiate a compromise in the midst of such a conflict. Both the elders who had held their positions for centuries and their disciples were all extremely arrogant. Their pride would not allow them to compromise without a fight. They were enraged by this sudden challenge and Ye Qingyu had clearly singled them out with his message, so everyone at the Four Stars Sect treated this as an unforgivable crime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the crimes they had committed against Ye Qingyu and the Heaven Wasteland Domain——</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Haha, that was just the strong punishing the weak. Wasn't it what they had deserved?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No one has dared to challenge us for several millennia. Haha, I guess the people in the current era have yet to experience the power and might of the Four Stars Sect for themselves. Ye Qingyu is destined to be a withered bone at the foot of our mountain."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Killing Ye Qingyu will be as simple as killing a dog."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He has become way too haughty."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Those who dare to challenge us will be destined to die and will have to pay for their crimes with their blood."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the Four Stars Holy Girl made her statement, the elders of the Four Stars Sect also issued their statements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially so for the Seven Sons of the Four Stars Sect. These seven people were the most elite experts of the younger generation and had once astonished the entire Vast Thousand Domains with their might before they entered the sect to practice their cultivation in self-isolation. It was said that they were the personal disciples of the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect. They had re-emerged eight years ago and had stunned everyone with their incredible prowess. They had been itching to battle against someone of their caliber, so now that the [Ice Sword Killing God] was suddenly targeting the Four Stars Sect, this was the perfect opportunity for them to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only surprising thing was that the current Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect had yet to release a statement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite being one of the closest allies of the Four Stars Sect, the Mizar Dynasty of the Mizar Domain also remained silent on this issue. Nonetheless, many people witnessed that there was some movement of the elite troops of the Mizar Race, as though they were preparing for some action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To everyone's surprise, the Black Moon Immortal Palace, which had been ordered by the Alliance of Domains to seal their sect in self-reflection, broke their silence to voice their support for the Four Stars Sect publicly. The current palace master of the Black Moon Immortal Palace even stated brazenly, "The [Ice Sword Killing God] Madman Ye is the festering tumor of the Human Race. His ways are cruel and ruthless, and his hands are stained with blood. The Black Moon Immortal Palace has decided to break our silence to form an alliance with the Four Stars Sect to kill this evil being!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several senior elders of the Black Moon Immortal Palace were even more outspoken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They went around proclaiming brazenly that the punishment that their sect had been forced to bear was a conspiracy orchestrated by Ye Qingyu, and that the previous spokesperson of the Human Race, Ren Puyang, acted on his own accord to mete out this unfair punishment. Now that Ren Puyang was dead, this sentence was no longer valid and the Black Moon Immortal Palace would no longer follow the orders of anyone from the Human Race headquarters of the Alliance of Domains. Ren Puyang had paid the price for his actions and deserved death...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The situation became chaotic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time flew by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a blink of an eye, ten days flew by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone focused their attention on the Heaven Wasteland Building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the morning of the 11th day, the skies were bright and clear. Ye Qingyu emerged from the Heaven Wasteland Building clad in his white robes, and exited the Domain Gate at the north end of Heaven Connect City to leave the Chaotic Ruins Domain, heading for the Four Sects Domain where the Four Stars Sect was located.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This news shook the entire city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was the battle that would shake the entire Vast Thousand Domains about to finally begin?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless figures secretly followed Ye Qingyu from behind. They wanted to witness this upcoming frightening battle for themselves. There had even been countless other forces and experts who had already entered the Four Stars Domain and were hanging around the sect gate of the Four Stars Sect, waiting for this epic battle to begin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Six hours later—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu appeared at the outer fringes of the Four Stars Sect's sect gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stood on a stone floor outside a divine temple that was suspended in midair and floated in the clouds. His white robes were like jade and his black hair spilled like a waterfall over his shoulders; his eyes as bright as the stars; his nose upright; and his aura like an Immortal as his white robes fluttered in the wind. He looked exactly like a peerless genius of the Human Race and seemed like an Immortal being who was not of the earth. His handsomeness and elegance could not be described in words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The experts from the various lands surrounded him and also appeared on the horizon, paying close attention to his every action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is this what the [Ice Sword Killing God] looks like?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He indeed looks like the manifestation of all the great things in the universe and a true dragon amongst men. All else aside, his elegance and aura are enough to distinguish him from not only the Human Race, but also among all the other races throughout the universe. It would be extremely difficult to find another person who would be able to be his match amongst the younger generation!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A heaven-defying genius will always emerge from the Human Race."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This divine temple that he is controlling doesn't look like an ordinary artifact. I've never heard of it before." Some of the crowd's gaze fell on the divine temple at Ye Qingyu's feet and thought it odd that no one knew about such a treasure and wondered why Ye Qingyu had never produced this item before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon after, the divine temple arrived at the foot of the Four Stars Sect's main gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The main gate of the Four Stars Sect was located in the Starry Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Starry Mountain Range was a unique mountain range within the Four Stars Domain. All the mountains along this mountain range were independent peaks, and unlike most of the mountain ranges in this universe, these peaks were rarely interconnected. From the top, the mountains of this mountain range resembled independent stars and that was how it got its name. It was truly a beautiful name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Sect took up most of the land along this mountain range and their sect had been fortifying this range for thousands of years and it was now known to be impregnable. There were countless defensive and deadly formations within it and millions of disciples within the sect. Their experts were too numerous to count and their buildings could be seen all along the thousands of mountain peaks, regardless of size. This was not a mountain range that floated in midair, but this sight was as dazzling as bright stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like a fairyland and the scenery was both gorgeous and meandering—an unforgettable sight to behold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Sect had already received word of Ye Qingyu's arrival. And everyone, including the sect master, the thousands of core disciples and elders, as well as the Four Stars Holy Girl, the Seven Sons of the Four Stars Sect, and many famous experts, emerged from the sect and stood in the void that was a hundred kilometers from the sect gates. Then, they waited in huge numbers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides the disciples of the Four Stars Sect, there were other experts from the Black Moon Immortal Palace and other allies of the Four Stars Sect. And when these people emerged, it was like an air current that rolled on for thousands of kilometers—they were like a divine and heavenly army with an imposing aura and looked extremely frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moments later—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The divine temple stopped moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu stood at the top of the divine temple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The divine temple stopped around one thousand meters away from the Four Stars Sect's army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The air suddenly became highly charged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless pairs of eyes locked with each other in the air, as though sparks were about to fly at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu remained calm even as he faced an army of thousands single-handedly. He looked out calmly across the area and silently exerted his [Eyes of the Void] to gain a thorough understanding of the Four Stars Sect's army. Then, he could not help letting out an admiring sigh. This sect was indeed an ancient sect with a legacy of several thousand years as its resources were truly deep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone in the Four Stars Sect stood in their positions in the void. These thousands of experts all stood in different positions and each one of their positions was profound in its own way. They had secretly drawn on the force of the universe to form an invincible formation. They lined up like the stars in the universe and contained great and profound mysteries. The rolling clouds in the sky circulated around them like a nebula and seemed to possess a mysterious force that could not be deciphered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This formation alone was enough to maintain their invincible advantage when they faced off against formidable opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were the actions and mannerisms of a true superforce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You shouldn't have chosen the wrong path. Your glorious achievements of the past have now been tainted. If you don't realize your mistakes, I'll be the one to induce this awakening and force you to turn over a new leaf,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Ye Qingyu thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, a loud voice could be heard from the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Are you the [Ice Sword Killing God], Ye Qingyu?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A burly, fierce elder spoke from the Four Stars Sect's camp and his voice echoed like a heavenly bell. He spoke with the authority and haughtiness of someone who held a lofty position and seemed extremely arrogant. His voice echoed throughout the void so loudly that he could almost be heard all across the entire domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled in a relaxed manner and nodded, "Yes, I am."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"As someone from the Human Race, how dare you release such a bold statement and claim that you want to go on a punitive expedition against us! You are inciting an internal war between the same race and your actions would not only harm your own kind, but our enemies would rejoice at this internal strife. As the third deputy spokesperson of the Human Race, you did not think about rejuvenating our race, but instead, continued to target and kill your fellow humans. This is a despicable crime…" This Four Stars Sect elder continued as though he was reading a royal edict, his tone admonishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu remained calm and did not move to interrupt this elder. Instead, he continued to listen quietly as this elder listed his crimes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This elder of the Four Stars Sect spoke for fifteen minutes and accused him of a litany of crimes before concluding that Ye Qingyu was guilty of no less than twenty crimes and divided them into three broad categories. The first was killing his fellow Humans—Feng Wuheng, Yang Wanqu, Ye Chongsheng, and other fellow Human Race experts. The second was disregarding the authority of his elders and attempting to challenge their authority. And the third was overstepping his boundaries and meddling in the affairs of the Alliance of Domains. Then, his voice boomed like thunder as he asked, "Do you admit to your crimes?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu shook his head speechlessly and said frankly, "I do."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The evidence speaks for itself, there's no point trying to deny it. Even if you try to talk your way out of it…" That elder continued instinctively and only realized that something was wrong halfway through his speech. His eyes suddenly widened and he gasped at Ye Qingyu in surprise with his mouth agape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had not expected Ye Qingyu to admit to his list of crimes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Uh...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things were not meant to turn out this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was suddenly at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sect master of the Four Stars Sect frowned slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Holy Girl, who stood beside him, took two steps forward and picked up where that elder had left off. She said clearly, "Brother Ye Qingyu, it has been a year since our battle at Capital Sky Peak, and I can see that you're doing well. You look even better than before, so I wonder why you are deliberately trying to barge into our sect gate today?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was dressed in white palace robes that were as fair as snow and not tainted with a speck of dirt or dust. Her body blazed with divine light and she exuded an incomparable beauty and aura—she truly was the holy goddess who was admired by countless young men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's gaze locked on her for a while, then he said with a sigh, "You are already a beauty, so why did you allow yourself to sink to such depths?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the Four Stars Holy Girl could respond, Ye Qingyu's face hardened and he said frankly, "You should know why I'm here today. Since you neither want to nor have the guts to mention it, I will not waste any more time listing your crimes and revealing your hypocrisy. Since the ancient times, history has been written by the victors, so I shall let your descendants judge what is right or wrong for themselves… Anyway, since you have formed such a formidable army, you're obviously not here to discuss what is right or wrong. Let's battle then!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as he finished speaking—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body suddenly straightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His aura surged, his qi traveled for ten thousand kilometers like a divine dragon, and his abundant yuan qi rippled throughout the area like roaring waves, which stunned the heavens and swept the clouds into disarray. Mist circulated all around and the void twisted. Everyone realized to their surprise that despite facing an army of thousands single-handedly, he did not look like he was at a disadvantage at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A moment of dead silence fell throughout the land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A moment later, someone transformed into a ray of flowing light and shot out from the Four Stars Sect's camp to charge at Ye Qingyu with his sword light sharp and imbued with killing intent. His aura was extremely violent as he roared, "Ye Qingyu, I, Meng Wuyou of the Seven Sons of the Four Stars Sect, will kill you today!"&nbsp;</span></p>
