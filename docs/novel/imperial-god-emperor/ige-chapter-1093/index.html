 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1093, The profound meaning of time</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon Ye Qingyu realized that the [Supreme Ice Flame]] indeed had a natural restraint on the force of darkness. He could feel with his divine sense the terror of the blood of the Demon Lord. Facing this drop of blood that had been dried up for tens of millions of years, Ye Qingyu even felt more terrified than facing Quasi-emperor Mushan and the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect. Fortunately, under the force of the [Supreme Ice Flame], the dark blood was fully trapped within it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wisps of dark blood, under the stimulation of the [Supreme Ice Flame]], suddenly vibrated and produced demonic roars. The strands of black light that were as fine as strands of hair were struggling frantically like vicious python dragons, and as though it had sensed the presence of Ye Qingyu's divine sense, let out a mad roar and sped towards the location of where Ye Qingyu’s divine sense body was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Suppress! Gather! Ignite!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's divine sense body bellowed, forming three hand seals consecutively, and struck out three ancient formation symbols.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These three ancient words were symbols of the secret technique of the one hundred eight ancient characters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's understanding and mastery of the one hundred eight ancient characters had more or less reached a perfect level. After three formation markings were launched out, the [Supreme Ice Flame]], like oil being poured onto raging flames, erupted in a blaze, burning frantically and incinerating the counterattack of the blood of darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Visible to the naked eye, rays of python-blood, dragon-like light, under the incineration of the [Supreme Ice Flame]], were turned to ice crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who was it that helped me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another voice sounded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The incomparably huge dragon that was imprisoned in the dark blood had awakened all of a sudden. It snapped open its eyes, which were like two blood-red stars suspended in the Void. He released a divine light, which locked onto Ye Qingyu as he exclaimed in surprise, “A human?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice was full of puzzlement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu did not speak, but continued to trigger the [Supreme Ice Flame]]. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can manipulate this divine fire, who are you?” the Dragon God illusion asked. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was about to speak, when Wang Jianru's voice all of a sudden sounded in his ear, “Don’t pay attention to it, the dragon tooth has been eroded by the blood of darkness. He and the blood of darkness are one body. Both are dark forces, don't be tricked by him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu abruptly took on a look of shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon a closer look, the huge dragon indeed did not look quite right. The scales were vaguely covered in black mist, and his eyes were like a sea of blood. In the depths of the blood was a faintly visible black colour. Wang Jianru was right; it really had been eroded and saturated in dark forces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So Ye Qingyu did not respond and continued to activate the [Supreme Ice Flame]] to incinerate and purify at full speed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Human, thank you for helping me, once you burn out these dark forces you will be able to release me.” The Great Divine Dragon opened his mouth and spoke, “You have saved me, you can get whatever you want, just tell me, the great Dragon God will not refuse your request.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu still didn't speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The giant dragon was still constantly opening its mouth, tempting Ye Qingyu with all kinds of promises.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Wang Jianru's reminder, Ye Qingyu knew that it was simply trying to distract him; therefore, he directly closed the hearing of the body of the divine sense, and focused completely on the activation of [Supreme Ice Flame]].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, aware of this, the giant Divine Dragon began to rage and threaten him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it had no use.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Supreme Ice Flame] was the nemesis of the blood of darkness. Moreover Ye Qingyu's strength was infinitely close to the level of the Quasi-emperor realm. Under the activation, about an hour later, the blood of darkness had been melted and destroyed, while the black strands of light inside the huge dragon body were also refined, turned into fine snowflakes that fluttered in the white Void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, there was a flash of divine light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The illusion of the great Divine Dragon quickly dissipated, disappearing in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Between Heaven and earth only a huge tooth of tens of thousands of meters long was left behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tooth of the Dragon God.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a real entity, and not an illusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the purified [Blood-soaked Dragon Tooth]. The blood of darkness inside had been incinerated and dispersed by the [Supreme Ice Flame], revealing its true original form. Looking at this huge snow-white tooth, Ye Qingyu, also couldn’t help feeling astounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the true tooth of the Dragon God, which was comparable to the imperial weapon of a martial arts Emperor, right? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even after countless years of being corroded by the blood of the Demon Lord, when it had restored to its true original form, it was still astonishing. A tooth that was tens of thousands of meters large, then how terrifying was the complete body of the Dragon God? And after so many years it still exuded a strong noble presence, aura and power unique to the Dragon Race. If this were taken to the Dragon Human Domain, it would most likely be treated as an unparalleled sacred object.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu lamented, withdrawing his divine sense from the space of the [Northern Underworld Jade].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Finally done.” Wang Jianru also breathed a sigh of relief, “To refine it, you have spent one year of time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Ye Qingyu exclaimed, “One year... I just felt an hour pass by, how...” He didn't carry on, because he realized that it was very likely that the flow of space and time in the [Northern Underworld Jade] was different from that of the normal world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I need to take away the tooth of the Dragon God that had been purified.” Wang Jianru said, “This is very important to us. I can give you other compensation?” She spoke in a negotiable tone to Ye Qingyu, but this tone of voice also clearly sounded as though she very much hoped of obtaining the tooth of the Dragon God.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If teacher needs it then take it away,” Ye Qingyu said unhesitatingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The value of the tooth of the Dragon God was comparable to an imperial weapon, but Ye Qingyu already had the [Cloud Top Cauldron], as well as the endlessly growing [Blood Drinker Sword], therefore he did not need other imperial weapon materials. Besides, Wang Jianru and Song Xiaojun were together, and since this dragon tooth was very important to them then Ye Qingyu would not be too greedy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's straightforward answer had moved Wang Jianru. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She nodded admiringly, “This [Northern Underworld Jade] is also a rare treasure, able to change time. If used effectively it is comparable to an imperial weapon. Adding to this, it contains the profound meaning of the power of time. If understood, it is possible to step into the Great Emperor realm and you may be able to understand the real profound meaning of time. You should keep it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then junior will accept it.” Ye Qingyu did not refuse this time, and stored away the [Northern Underworld Jade].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, after knowing that the inner space of the jade was that huge and can change the flow of time, he became very curious about it. In the ancient bronze book [Fiendgod Titled Chart], there was also a cultivation technique that was related to time. However, the power was strange and involved the profound meaning of the origin of time. Ye Qingyu had not been able to fully understand it, thus perhaps with the help of this [North Underworld Jade] he could be enlightened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time and space were originally the greatest mysterious power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The matter here is finished, I need to leave.” Wang Jianru pulled out the dragon tooth from the jade space, and carefully stored it in a jade box, and then withdrew the sword light formation that was arranged around the Dragon cave. “In the coffin under the ice peak of the great snow mountain is an elder, who is the chief God who had fallen back then. It is she who set up the [Dragon God Formation], and sealed the [Blood-soaked Dragon Tooth] here. Unfortunately, she had waited thousands of years for the person she wanted to see. I'm going to take her away to the place where she should go. The Snow Dragon Race outside the Dragon cave was actually born from being affected by her aura back then. They are considered her descendants. It was she who sealed the [Blood-soaked Dragon Tooth] and protected Heaven Wasteland Domain. It was also here where you obtained a lot of opportunities.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior understands.” Ye Qingyu nodded and then asked, “Shortly, I will go to the domain of darkness, I do not know if at that time...” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Jianru smiled, then said in a meaningful tone of voice, “At that time, as long as you want, you can see Song Xiaojun.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was overjoyed, breathing a sigh of relief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That's great.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a flash, Wang Jianru's figure had already left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu, standing on the summit of the snow mountain, could clearly feel that the qi of great evil around the icy peak had begun to dissipate. He believed that it would not be long before the Snow Dragon cemetery would become sacred and peaceful again, and the Snow Dragon Race would no longer be troubled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He walked down the Snow Dragon Mountain, and as expected saw that the ice crystal coffin below was already gone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then it was from the coffin where silly dog Little Nine took out a dragon egg, which hatched into the dragon Little Silver. Ye Qingyu originally planned to take the Little Snow Dragon to the Snow Dragon's lair, unfortunately the Little Snow Dragon had fused with the Light Palace, turned into a spirit, and although it could free itself from the palace, these days he was in the middle of training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the woman in the ice crystal coffin, she was likely to be somewhat related to the Little Silver, but Ye Qingyu still did not know her name and background. From what Wang Jianru had said, there must be a beautiful love story about the fairy-like woman. Perhaps when Ye Qingyu arrives at the domain of darkness, he could help the Little Silver find some clues about his life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu suddenly felt that his life was similar to that of Little Silver.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a slight stay, Ye Qingyu left the underground Snow Dragon cemetery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the icy snow space outside, the Snow Dragon King and other Snow Dragons were waiting patiently, They had already hibernated for a season, and now was the season of awakening again. Ye Qingyu’s appearance was met with a cheering roar from the Snow Dragon King, while the other huge Snow Dragons joyously crowded around Ye Qingyu like they were worshipping the God Emperor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stayed here for another day, talking about martial arts to the Snow Dragons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu passed on the [True Will of tthe Sky Dragon] that the million-year-old soul had taught him to the Snow Dragons, and then handed them some martial arts manuals that he had obtained from the [Infinite Arsenal] of the Domain Alliance that were suitable for the Snow Dragon Race to practice. The Snow Dragon Race was actually a group of kindhearted creatures that stood aloof from worldly affairs. Ye Qingyu hoped that such pure creatures could continue to live and reproduce in this world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A day later, Ye Qingyu left the Snow Dragon lair and returned to Snow capital. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A year of time had passed since he left. The Heaven Wasteland Empire and even the Vast Thousand Domains had undergone great changes——</span></p>
