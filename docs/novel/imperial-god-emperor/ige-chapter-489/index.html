 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then in Youyan Pass, the disciples of the Crepe Myrtle Sect, Violet sSeven Stars Sect as well as the Tiger Dragon School of the Three Sects and Three Schools, were incredibly arrogant because of their background.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this time in the war of the Light City, the strength of the Three Sects and Three Schools——and even the power of the various sects within the territory of the empire, were calculated. Not only did they massacre one another, it could even be said that their hundred years of foundation was uprooted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, besides the few sect experts loyal to Left Minister and old Marshal Li Guangbi, that had resisted the so-called temptation of the treasury of the [Light Palace], and did not enter the Earth Fire spirit spring sword pit, in order to bypass the killing formation, all the other sects suffered a disastrous loss. Some sects were completely destroyed, from the elders to the final generation of disciples. Not one person survived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sects that had suffered a calamity a hundred years ago because of the rise of the Snow Empire were once again, through this plan, critically wounded and weakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, sects would never have the power to contend with the Snow Empire.&nbsp;</span></p>

Old Commander Li Guangbi, under the advice of Yu Junhan, led an army of elite troops to plough through and tidy up the major sects once more.</span></p>

Whether this was a blessing or a curse, before the foreign forces really came pouring in, they had to first of all completely eliminate the instability within the Snow Empire. This was to prevent the sects that were unwilling to give up their past glory from colluding with forces of foreign domains. The disaster would be even greater at that time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This process, for these sects, was also tragic.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine General Gong of the Five Great Divine Generals of the [Light Palace], Gao Diping personally oversaw everything. The military of the empire had the final say in the important matters of the Crepe Myrtle Sect, including the choice of the candidate for the new head of the sect.&nbsp;</span></p>

The major experts and masters of the Tiger sub-sect fled overnight, and only a few people remained behind, accepting the imperial military takeover...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But those people of the Tiger sub-sect that fled also did not really evade the military. Ten days later, the head of the Tiger Sect Zhao Jin was killed in the territory of the White Mountain Black Waters, and the Tiger sub-sect was declared completely destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of the Three Sects and Three Schools, only Matchless Blade City was respected by the Imperial army. Li Guangbi personally visited the Divine Blade Palace of the Matchless Blade City and met with Qin Zhishui who had just become the City Lord. Soon after the Matchless Blade City declared to the outside world that they surrendered and pledged allegiance to the empire, and became a special military ministry of the empire.</span></p>

He was not only arrogant but wounded several empire officials who came to urge him to move. He also threatened that he was not moving, and there was nothing they could do...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After an hour, his head was hung directly on the announcement pillar within the relocation area.</span></p>

The Right Minister who was usually very protective of his subordinates also showed no trace of politeness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After this, the nobles no longer dared to fight back.</span></p>

Both nobles and ordinary people would receive relatively good compensation, particularly ordinary people. After relocation, they would be given residence and better compensation and treatment than before.</span></p>
