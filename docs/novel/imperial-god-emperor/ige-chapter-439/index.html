Even if his flesh was sliced apart blade by blade, Yang Henshui would not even frown. After all, for a Bitter Sea stage expert, unless their heads were destroyed or their internal organs were shattered into pieces, these were not fatal wounds. Mere pain could not be counted as anything for experts at this realm.&nbsp;</span></p>

He slowly lay beside Yang Henshui, also fainting. Evidently, he could not stay conscious any longer.&nbsp;</span></p>

As his hand extended towards the burnt wounded areas on the two's body, there was a scorching flame that was hot like a blade surging out, posing an extremely strange sight.</span></p>

There was a rare serious expression on Wen Wan's face, "Quickly return. This fire poison is most likely something only our Lord will be able to do something about. If we delay in the slightest, then they both will be in danger!"</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As one of the most relied upon strategist by Jin San, this person was bestowed with the surname of Jin. This scolar of another race was called Jin Shun, and he was originally a top level expert. It was said that he had some background, and was not like the other leaders of the Brute Race, where he absolutely feared Jin San. Often, if there were questions that others did not dare ask in front of Jin San, he would ask it. If there were people who did not dare speak in front of Jin San, he would dare speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's nothing, they just killied some lowly scum women of the Human Race. But they did not follow my orders, so they should long have died. Seeing several women, they could not control themselves. Such warriors are not fit to follow beside me. What worth do they have? Its perfect if they die." There was a faint smile on Jin San's face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After pausing a bit, he said once again, "To be killed by the experts of the Human Race is the most value that will be gained from them. It can boost the moral of our soldiers. Furthermore..." As he said to here, Jin San's gaze, through the tent, stared at the [Light Palace] far off. "That person in the human [Light Palace] is somewhat interesting. To think he would dare use the Order of Light to provoke me, should I not return him with something? Those seven Envoys of Light, I originally wanted to cripple them all. Who would have thought that these seven envoys were not useless trash. They were outside of my expectations. Especially that dog, as well as that dark faced scholar who came out at the end, they are worth paying attention to!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Jin Shun lightly caressed his white bone fan. Smiling, "I understand now. Lord, you want that person to expend his attention and cultivation to treat and heal those two... the ['One Taste' True Flame], is unparalleled in the world. Even if that person expended all his cultivation, it is possible that he may not be able to erase it entirely. But it will aid you instead. The profoundness of the ['One Taste' True Flame] will be able to investigate into the martial cultivation of that person."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's not only just so." Jin San smiled, saying, "Although the fact that the Human Race has newly appointed this person into the [Light Palace] is somewhat unexpected and surprising, but this is not what we must fear the most. What I mainly want to do is to determine whether that War God of the past still exists or not. He is truly the existence that threatens the life and death of our race. If the situation is not right for us, we will immediately apologize and withdraw our troops and leave the three provinces in the North East. This will prevent that person from destroying and annihilating everything in his rage." &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "But in the rumours, is that person not already dead?" Jin Shun asked with surprise. "In these years, our race has probed into this matter countless times, having an infinite number of investigations. Even the three great elders of the Magic Pavillion sacrificed years of their life, but they were not able to find any signs of life from that person. This means, that person has long disappeared and died, his soul scattered and gone. He does not exist in this world anymore."“</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "That Fiendgod of the past was far too terrifying. His abilities could bypass the heavens and slice apart the Earth. It is not something you nor I can imagine. With his power alone, he suppressed the Heavens itself. Even if he disappeared for a hundred years, the threat is not yet gone. All the sects within Heaven Wasteland Domain fears to make a move. In these years, all the factions and forces are just testing the waters, fearing that person has left a trap behind. A hundred years, perhaps that is a long time from the perspective of a normal person. But for experts such as them, it is but just an instant. In these hundreds of years, the fact that none of the forces has been able to find any traces of him makes them even more unsettled. For such a Fiendgod, how could he suddenly perish just like that?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As Jin San spoke of this, there was a deep apprehension in his eyes flashing by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He was the infamous leader of the [Berserk Horned Army], and he would not even fear an army of thousands. Even in front of the North Eastern Brute Race King, he was fully confident. But to think there would be such an expression revealed when that person's name was mentioned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Jin Shun nodded his head thoughtfully. "Lord, you mean that only by causing disturbance amongst the capital of the Human Race can we detect some ripples. If that Fiendgod of the past still truly exists, then perhaps he would allow war, fire and conflict to spread everywhere. But he would absolutely not tolerate the [Light Palace] that he constructed with his own hands to be destroyed."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Jin San nodded his head. "The branch of the Saint Race of the North Western Great Desert as well as the demon courts hves also came to Snow Capital. We may not need to do anything ourselves, we can just observe and see."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

He looked towards the military airships that blocked their path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Wei Hua of the Right Minster. I am obeying orders to patrol this area. I heard there is a battle occurring near the area where the Brute Race envoys are located. I've already asked the surrounding spectators, it is said that the seven Envoys of Light of the [Light Palace] has incited the Brute Race and caused trouble." A young man wearing pure black armour stood at the very front and center of the airship as he spoke, both his hands crossed as he said such words. He looked to be about twenty years of age, with no hair to be seen on his face. "Is there such a matter?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Wei Hua”...?”</span></p>

Hearing this, he clasped his hands, "That's right, we are obeying the orders of the Lord of the Light Palace. We have taken care of those Brute Race soldiers who raped those women several days ago..."</span></p>

The young man called Wei Hua wearing pure black armour let out a long laugh. "No need to explain too much. The reason the Brute Race entered into the capital is to eliminate any hostilities. The Right Minister has long placed an order that one must treat them with courtesy and respect. For you to dare intrude upon their location and kill their people, you really have malicious intentions. Could it be that you want to destroy the negotiation of peace? Follow me and explain yourself at the Right Minister's residence.”</span></p>

Laughable. I need to immediately return to report back to my lord in the [Light Palace]. Move away, don't make a mistake."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Every second that was delayed would mean Yang Henshui and Li Changheng would be placed in greater danger.</span></p>

Gao Han, an Envoy of Light is it? Very good, I’ll remember you.”</span></p>

Cold glimmers of light aimed towards the people on the Light flying airship. These were piercing yuan armour arrows. Under the attack of thousands of arrows, it would pose a threat to even top level experts.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was something they had planned deliberately onto the unsuspecting. The abilities of these seven Envoys of Light had clearly been investigated beforehand. Right now, two had nearly been killed. Furthermore, there were many cards hidden up his sleeve, with all sorts of guarantees. As long as he acted, he could instantly use this opportunity to kill the seven Envoys of Light. This could be counted as cutting off seven arms from that little brat. At that time, he would not be able to be so arrogant from then on.</span></p>

With a strike of his hand, light flickered. With the cultivation of the [Proud Eagle] Wei Hua, he was not even able to react. his head was hacked off, and grabbed in the hands of that person.</span></p>
