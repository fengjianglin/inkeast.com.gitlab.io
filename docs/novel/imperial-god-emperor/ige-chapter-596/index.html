Furthermore, this terror was only the surface-level direct changes. The entire Spirit qi and fortune of the Clear River Domain had already began to transform and change in the background. This sort of transformation would take a very long time in the future before being discovered by others.&nbsp;</span></p>

Looking at the far off city, they could not help but display emotions of disappointment. Amidst the dim sun, they could see the far off huge rock barrier. Under the vast city walls, they let out a gentle sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Flowing Light City of the past, was tens of thousands of meters high, buildings lined up like the tooth of a comb, as if it were a divine country.&nbsp;</span></p>

Smoke drifted everywhere, a bloody stench covering everything, as if it was a dead city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Flowing Light fortress city that had once been impenetrable for thousands of years had now become dim and lifeless. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; There was the sound of wind passing through the crevice and crack of the broken walls, as if it was crying in a low voice about it's tragic and sorrowful state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; At the city gates, they could see the Demon Spider Race army traversing through, as well as some intermittent human figures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "En? The Demon Spider Race has occupied the Flowing Light City, but they did not completely butcher the city?" Seeing this, Hu Bugui was slightly taken aback. "The Demon Spider Race is famed for being brutal. In the previous human and demon great battles of the past, as long as they occupied a human city, they would butcher everyone inside. They would treat humans as their food source. From what it seemed like right now, they really had plans to rule over Flowing Light City? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu looked at Flowing Light City far off in the distance, and heard Hu Bugui's words. Hearing his words, his heart relaxed slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; No matter what, the city having not been butchered was definitely good news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; At least it represented that the Flowing Light City in front of their eyes had not yet transformed into a sea of blood and a mountain of corpses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; “Who knows what the Demon Spider Race is doing this time?" There was a trace of suspicion on Hu Bugui's face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu let out a breath of relief, saying, "We can't care too much. Since they have not butchered the city, then we can pretend to be refugees and enter. We should act as the situation demands."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good." Hu Bugui nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The two came from the Greater One mountains, and had a long journey. They were originally tattered and dirty, so they did not have to assume any disguise. Hiding away their yuan qi fluctuation, their outer appearance was like two refugees. Following the path, they entered through the city gate, and entered into Flowing Light City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The soldiers of the Demon Spider Race army only gave them a glance without saying anything.</span></p>

Not long after entering the city gate did they truly enter into the main interior of the city. Hu Bugui suddenly lifted his head and looked to the right, opening his eyes wide.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu followed his gaze as he looked, and instantly froze where he stood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In the distance, there was a forest of flags. There were several hundred ten-meter-tall flag poles of all sorts of sizes that stood there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The last time he came to Flowing Light City, Ye Qingyu had seen this forest of flags. On every flag pole, there was the flag that represented one of the forces of the Human Race within Flowing Light City. They were like dragons dancing in the wind, and presented an awe inspiring sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But right now, it was not flags that were on the flag poles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; It was heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; It was the heads of humans that had their eyes wide open, having been chopped off when they were still alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu looked at the poles that originally held the city's flag, the originally dark flagpoles had already been covered with flesh blood. It's colour had long been transformed into a shocking dim red colour. &nbsp;</span></p>
