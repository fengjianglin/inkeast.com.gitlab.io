 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1038 – The Horror of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Similarly, Quasi-emperor Mushan operated an Emperor path eye technique. With purple eye beams circulating in his pupils, he coordinated with the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor’s offensive and mercilessly bombarded [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei’s] doppelganger with destructive purple radiance, intending to incinerate the latter. This was known as the [Mushan Purple] technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Li Xiaofei remained standing where he was without evading.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes were fixed on the macaque-resembling, lightning-wielding Quasi-emperor. By observing the green formations circulating in the latter’s eyes, he was able to figure out the latter’s origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see, you’re a rotten corpse which didn’t stiffen after death and managed to step out from a coffin. Is it your intention to mess up time and space? Fuck off back to where you belong!” Li Xiaofei guffawed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Resembling a killing god at this moment, his black hair fluttered and his qi activity ran wild. He paid no attention to the purple pupil radiance and allowed it to freely bombard him while also disregarding and enduring the punches from the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor. The strange formations on his doppelganger circulated the power to resist these attacks, ensuring that he did not break into pieces. However, he spewed out large amounts of blood from his mouth, while fragments of his viscera moreso spurted from the palm mark wounds on his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, catching the other three Quasi-emperors by surprise, he unleashed feedback force and zipped his way in front of the macaque-resembling ancient Quasi-emperor. With great laughter pouring out simultaneously, he spewed a mouthful of blood directly at the latter’s face. His matchlessly ferocious vigor, combined with the laughing sound waves which contained immense Emperor power, transfixed the latter for a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, he exerted a punch, rupturing the greater part of the latter’s body at once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ugh...” The latter wailed in anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a mix of shock and anger, he rapidly retreated to distance himself away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How can Li Xiaofei be so fierce and insane?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’s still able to unleash such power in spite of the flank attacks of the other two Quasi-emperors. Shouldn’t his doppelganger have shattered under normal circumstances?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling a bout of terror and awe, the macaque-resembling, lightning-wielding Quasi-emperor continually retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He dared not believe that he himself, who had lived for a long time and experienced countless battles, was currently not only heavily injured but also suppressed in vigor and battle will by a later-generation human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahahahaha...” Li Xiaofei guffawed, his body dyed red by fresh blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Though heavily injured, his vigor was increasing frenziedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A heroic atmosphere, hard to describe in words, grew within the Void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, this blood-soaked figure was standing tall like never before in an utterly fearless and crazy manner. Lingering around him was an all-destructive ferity which was not derived from martial power or universal laws, but from one breath and a kind of will which alone could repel a million powerful enemies. Unlike the figure which used to quietly sit cross-legged in the Void, he was presently standing tall among the universal sky with unprecedented savagery and imperiousness, as if he ruled the entire universe and his laughter was replete with fearlessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His laughter could be heard throughout the world, while his strength could not be matched by any one race!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed as if it was only at this instant that the number one expert of the Vast Thousand Domains four thousand years ago was well and truly back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kind of change, vigor, and will completely stunned everyone who was watching this Emperor battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a time, none of the other three Quasi-emperors dared to draw near to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How… is this possible?” Jiang Xiaohan was shocked like never before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is he a deity or a demon?” The Four Stars holy girl, too, revealed a dismal countenance as she gazed at the indomitable giant figure in the distance, afraid to believe all that she had seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For some reason, despite him being their greatest enemy whom they hoped would disappear forever, they could not but admit that this lofty blood-soaked figure was the most admirable and exquisite thing they had ever seen in this world. The Four Stars holy girl also could not help inwardly admitting that the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor was significantly inferior by comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the three Quasi-emperors hadn’t surprise attacked him at the start, wouldn’t they all be defeated and dead by now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So, is this the might of the most powerful human expert who had been rated as number one under the heavens since four thousand years ago?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To one side, the Black Demon Abyss Crown Prince uttered a long cry and shouted, “Haha, this is the true Li Xiaofei for you. Legend has it that when he awed the world all those years back, he would bleed during every battle, and the more he bled, the more powerful and unstoppable he became… Hahaha, this is simply wonderful. How can the schemes and tricks of evil spirits possibly bury such an eternally brilliant and supreme expert? I worried too much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu shot a glance at him, feeling a slight jolt in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It appears that this Crown Prince is standing on [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]’s side. Could it be that, just like myself, it was to help Li Xiaofei that he fought against the two women?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [White Jade Capital] successor also finally revealed a relieved expression at this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There’s no doubt that she was also hoping for Li Xiaofei to win.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his sword will circulating and protecting him, Ye Qingyu looked all around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wobbling figure who appeared drunk was slowly walking toward him from a faraway distance. It was the successor of the Sky Meteor Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He left bloodied tracks across the starry sky as he walked, appearing to be significantly injured. However, the giant green wolf which had previously become his enemy was nowhere to be seen. Most likely, he had killed it but had to pay a considerable price himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a young man with a face of unswerving determination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter which side he stood on or which race he was from, his martial heart was steadfast like no other. Despite having suffered heavy injuries, he risked his own life to come to the fringes of the battlefield and watch the Quasi-emperor battle from afar, hoping to gain some martial enlightenment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu also saw that two human figures had arrived at the fringes of the battlefield since some time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of them was a youth with a haughty and somewhat familiar face. Upon careful thought, Ye Qingyu recalled that he was Lu Wei, the youth who had challenged him in the Wei River Mountain Range several months ago, before the descent of the Reincarnation Hall. Beside Lu Wei was an old man with snow white beard and hair but a ruddy complexion and baby-like smooth skin. He was the very embodiment of the phrase “crane-haired and child-faced”. Moreover, he had an imposing doppelganger and appeared to be of virtuous character. He offered no indication of his strength, such that even Ye Qingyu could not discern how strong he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from these two people, there were also several dozen figures, among which were some faces Ye Qingyu had not seen while ascending the Capital Sky Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Are they latecomers?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was surprised that there were people who were later than him in ascending Capital Sky Peak and arriving in this world of Quasi-emperor Dao battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">None of these people are weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they were not the people he was hoping to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After observing them for a long while, he felt rather disappointed that he did not see the million-year-old soul and Nan Tieyi among them. The former had claimed that he was going to run for his life, and had probably ran off to some unknown place by now. The latter had mysteriously disappeared and reappeared and had previously behaved rather oddly, causing Ye Qingyu to be somewhat worried about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a momentary quiet, things stirred up once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He can’t keep up much longer!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’d long been exhausted, how can he possibly turn things around?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The voices of the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor and Quasi-emperor Mushan rang out once more, breaking the strange silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they had been frightened by Li Xiaofei’s peerless and domineering vigor for some time, they were of Quasi-emperor cultivation after all and possessed thoroughly seasoned and unassailable Dao hearts. As such, they could not possibly be frightened for too long, quickly re-igniting their battle wills and taking action once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless streaks of terrifying power incessantly fell upon Li Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All worldly affairs, good and bad, are mine alone to dictate. With one smile, I shall invert the wheel of life!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Xiaofei uttered a long cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It moved the heavens and the galaxy, resonating across the stars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He began to fight back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom boom boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dao sounds boomed out once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor battle had resumed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, however, it instantly became white hot and many times fiercer than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All three Quasi-emperors were injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Like the legend had claimed, the more Li Xiaofei bled, the stronger he became.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had endured many heavy blows such that his body was nearly wrecked, his strength never stopped increasing at an insane rate. When he waved a fist, green radiance began to circulate, forcing the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor and Quasi-emperor Mushan to retreat, for they dared not look directly at this radiance. Even so, they began to suffer injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Xiaofei guffawed. “I trampled on the mountain gate of the Four Stars Sect four thousand years ago, and today I’m doing so again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Emperor roars filled the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His wounded body was nearly invincible and becoming increasingly powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ugh...” Quasi-emperor Mushan gave a frightened howl as he retreated, with his arms already battered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor also staggered back disbelievingly, spewing blood from his mouth. Having been struck by Li Xiaofei’s fist, cracks appeared on his doppelganger while rays of light nearly tore him apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill!” He charged up while still spewing blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He no longer had a route of retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His only choice was to fight to the death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had thought that everything had been calculated. Having launched a surprise attack at the start and ganged up with two other Quasi-emperors, killing Li Xiaofei was supposed to be a matter of time. Unexpectedly, however, this number one expert of four millenniums ago truly lived up to his name and was now on the verge of crushing them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I must kill Li Xiaofei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, if he manages to get out of this battle alive, he might truly become Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ugh...” Quasi-emperor Mushan yelled harshly once more, having been kicked on the back of his head by Li Xiaofei. Although his head did not explode from the terrifying power, his facial features were frenziedly oozing blood. In particular, his eyeballs had shot out from their sockets and were presently drifting in the Void like two stars which burned with purple radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was now somewhat afraid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How can the difference between us be this big when we’re both Quasi-emperors?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although staggering, the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor was still trying his hardest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The horror of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was fully displayed in this bloody battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, the Four Stars holy girl and the [Fatally Beautiful Fairy] had already turned pale-faced. They had vaguely sensed the imminence of defeat, and could only wonder how the situation developed in such a terrifying manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A shout was heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having finally restored his doppelganger, the macaque-resembling, lightning-wielding Quasi-emperor gave an angry roar and spread his hands. The lightning cone and hammer flew out from the hands of an astonished Jiang Xiaohan, turning into two beams of flowing light which soon fell into his hands. They then swelled along with the wind, becoming many times larger in size. Reddish-brown in color and covered in green patterns, the lightning cone was made from some unknown material and gave off a thick ancient qi. Instead, the lightning hammer was completely silver-colored and had a pure splendor, as if it was made from myriad silver-colored thunderbolts. Both of them contained an immense oppressive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After landing in the Quasi-emperor’s hands, this lightning cone and hammer pair became many times scarier than before, as if inner seals were removed and it was thereby revitalized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As cone and hammer collided, a boundless sea of green weapons smashed directly toward Li Xiaofei’s face instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Similarly, the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor gave a loud shout before taking away the [Four Stars Sword] in the Four Stars holy girl’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the sword hummed in his hand, it also seemed to become unsealed, suffusing an aura of terrifying power. An incomparably-vivid phantom of an ancient war Emperor soon appeared. It was wearing rattan armor and leather boots, while hanging at its waist was a stone sword. Below its messy hair was a dark and extremely distinct face on which simple yet strange totems were drawn using white paint. The aura emanating from this figure was many, many times more frightening than the Four Stars holy girl’s display of the sword’s secret technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor shouted as he struck down with both hands clutching the sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind him, the ancient Emperor also pulled out the stone sword from his waist and struck downward with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two Quasi-emperors were finally putting their Emperor weapons to use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boundless laws and power surged wildly, inundating Li Xiaofei instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was because there was nothing in his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Though you may be strong, you can’t change the fact that you were born into a small family, that being the Li family of the Ming Domain. Four thousand years ago, you smashed the only licorice gourd while in the Black Demon Abyss. What can you do without a foundation today?” Quasi-emperor Mushan guffawed as he placed his eyeballs back into their sockets before performing a flank attack. With an Emperor weapon in hand, a Quasi-emperor’s strength would skyrocket. And if it was a truly top-class Emperor weapon, a Quasi-emperor would become able to confront a true martial Emperor . This was the frightening aspect of an Emperor weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The situation was turned on its head once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing this scene, Ye Qingyu became terribly anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior...” He shouted out loud, “Take this cauldron!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Completely abandoning his own safety, he operated the technique of one hundred eight ancient characters and worked up the [Cloud Top Cauldron] to the limits of his ability before throwing it toward the centermost of the battlefield.</span></p>
