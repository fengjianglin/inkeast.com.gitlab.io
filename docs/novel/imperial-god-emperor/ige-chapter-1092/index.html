 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tooth of the Dragon God? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu couldn't help asking, “Is there really a Dragon God in this world?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course, the Three Emperors are the Gods of the Human Race, the Dragon God is naturally the God of the Dragon Race. Back in the God and Devil Age, the Dragon Race was a great race of the world, possessed remarkable strength, and was not in the slightest inferior to the Fiendgods. The Dragon God could be said to be one of the strongest existence between the heavens and earth,” Wang Jianru explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In that case, how could his tooth become an object of great evil? And who is the Demon Lord?’ Ye Qingyu was very interested in some of the secrets of the God and Devil Age.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Jianru explained, “In the God and Devil Age, there were God Emperors and Fiendgods, the strongest existences between Heaven and earth. They had once dominated the fate of tens of thousands of creatures, as well as dominated the history of the world. But in the most glorious times of the God and Devil Age, the foreign heavenly demons of darkness descended, wiped out everything, and even the God Emperor, Fiendgod, and the Dragon God were defeated. The ruler of the dark force claimed to be the Demon Lord. It was extremely terrifying. The original battle was extremely tragic, the Dragon God tore off the Demon Lord's arm but his divine dragon tooth was broken off. This is the origin of the [Blood-soaked Dragon Tooth]. Because it is contaminated with the Demon Lord's blood, this divine dragon tooth had been corroded by the dark forces, lost its divine nature, and turned into an object of great evil.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see.” Ye Qingyu began to understand, “The end of the God and Devil Age, is it related to this so-called foreign heavenly demons of darkness?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Jianru nodded, sighing, “Not just the God and Devil Age, behind the end of many glorious ages were the shadows of this dark force. They are demons that can never be killed completely. Every time they emerged after many years of disappearance, they swept across the world, and destroyed a number of glorious ages of civilization. It is the enemy of all intelligent beings, and even the Demon Race of the past regarded it as an enemy.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was shocked upon hearing this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time he heard about this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heavenly demons of darkness, do they exist in the domain of darkness?” Ye Qingyu asked again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These days, he began to understand the domain of darkness. He knew that it was a terrifying world shrouded in darkness, and from which terrifying dark creatures including Wei Wubing, Zhang Wuxin and the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor were born. He instinctively connected it to the heavenly demons of darkness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who knew that Wang Jianru shook her head and said, “The domain of darkness is only a buffer zone between the world of the living and the heavenly demons of darkness. It is a place full of ugliness and darkness, but is not the birthplace of the heavenly demons of darkness. The real heavenly demons of darkness were born out of the primitive world of darkness. It is the most terrifying dark creature in this world. And every time they appear, all that they brought to the world was destruction, death, and killing.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Buffer zone?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu somewhat understood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, if the heavenly demon of darkness, a creature that even the fiendgods could not do anything about, really existed in the domain of darkness, then it could be imagined that the domain of darkness would definitely be a forbidden land that destroys everything. Thus how would Ren Puyang and Lin Yutang, as well as others, enter the domain of darkness and eventually investigated something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu felt that he gradually had some clarity about the real situation of the world. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Unmoving City of Darkness, is it in the domain of darkness?” Ye Qingyu asked. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Jianru nodded, “This, you are not wrong, it is indeed. The Unmoving City of Darkness is not only located in the domain of darkness, but its years of existence is as long as that of the domain of darkness. Ever since the heavenly demons of darkness descended upon the world, the Unmoving City of Darkness has already been operating. To this day, it has been millions of years. Song Xiaojun is the current King of the Unmoving City of Darkness and her bloodline is extremely respected.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu wanted to ask more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Wang Jianru gave a wave of her hand and said, “This is something to talk about later, if there is time in the future I will slowly tell you. But today there is something we have to do, and that is to purify the [Blood-soaked Dragon Tooth]. This would be equal to removing a poison spot from Heaven Wasteland Domain. Otherwise, in the future it would certainly cause great calamity and even the destruction of Heaven Wasteland Domain.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, there was a ray of bright sword light leaping between her hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a very peculiar power of sword intent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu, after a glance, suddenly also produced a mysterious response. The sword intent in his body was gently vibrating, as if breaking out from his body. It seemed to be responding to the sword light between Wang Jianru's fingers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will break this [Northern Underworld Jade], which is the core that seals the altar. Its [Supreme Ice Flame] had been taken away by you long ago, so now to purify the [Blood-soaked Dragon Tooth] will require the power of your [Supreme Ice Flame], which inherently suppresses the blood of the Demon Lord. I hope that your mastery of the [Supreme Ice Flame] is able to contend against the blood of the Demon Lord that has dried up for tens of thousands of years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Jianru said with a solemn expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's face lit up with understanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder that Wang Jianru had asked to meet him in the Snow Dragon's lair. It turned out it was because of this. It was here that Ye Qingyu had a fortuitous encounter back then, and with the assistance of the million-year-old soul, he was able to obtain the [Supreme Ice Flame]. Although the [Northern Underworld Jade] could suppress the [Blood-soaked Dragon Tooth], it was not able to purify it, thus she needed Ye Qingyu's [Supreme Ice Flame].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood.” Ye Qingyu nodded. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a great martial arts expert he naturally very easily understood Wang Jianru’s meaning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All right, watch out,” Wang Jianru shouted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light between her fingertips suddenly erupted in a dazzling blaze, and a beam of bright and extremely clear flowing light shot out, flashed passed, and then she suddenly drew back. Her body was fully enveloped in sword intent, protecting her within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A moment of silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And then——&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kacha!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A light noise broke the silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thumb-sized white jade, which was floating on the crystal altar, cracked apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [Northern Underworld Jade] was broken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wisp of red light, like a fluttering strand of hair, floated out from the crack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With one thought, Ye Qingyu had already brought out several wisps of [Supreme Ice Flame] sword light, coiling around the broken [Northern Underworld Jade] like a robe chain. The power of [Supreme Ice Flame] penetrated through that crack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good.” Wang Jianru reminded, “Don't be careless, I'll be your protector.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she was speaking, countless beams of sword light, like sword seals, flew out from the palm of the female sword Immortal. In the blink of an eye, the true ice summit of the snow mountain and even the underground space of the Snow Dragon's lair were fully sealed. There was strange sword power flowing around, isolating everything, but also blocked everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kind of sword seal was even more marvelous than Ye Qingyu's sword intent. It was obvious that Wang Jianru's mastery of swordsmanship was much greater than Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that at this moment Ye Qingyu could not pay attention to these things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His divine sense was attached to the [Supreme Ice Flames], sealing and incinerating the [Northern Underworld Jade]. The [Blood-soaked Dragon Tooth] was in fact within this piece of strange jade. Ye Qingyu needed to penetrate the [Supreme Ice Flame] into the jade stone to thoroughly refine and eliminate that drop of blood of the Demon Lord that had dried up for thousands of years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A rumble of thunder sounded in Ye Qingyu's mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sight in front of him suddenly changed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is... is it... the world in the [Northern Underworld Jade]?” Ye Qingyu exclaimed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw a completely white world, there seemed to be no distinction between Heaven and earth, and everywhere was a vast expanse of white. He did not know which way was up and down, which was before and after, and could not distinguish between southeast and northwest. It felt even more lonely and icy-cold than the dark cosmic Void, as though he was lost in the torrent of time and space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu didn't think that this piece of thumb-sized jade would unexpectedly contain such a huge space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And it was not just this that shocked him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because he soon found that, in the white Void, there was a gigantic divine dragon that stretched across endless kilometers, hovering in the space. The body was exuding unparalleled majesty, and its dragon scales covered a radius of hundreds of thousands of meters. The dragon whiskers that fluttered in the absence of wind were like the rippling ocean surface. Looking at the huge dragon from afar, Ye Qingyu felt as tiny as a speck of dust next to a gigantic star. This was because he was very far away from this enormous dragon. If he were any closer, the contrast would be even more shocking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had never thought that there would be such a huge creature in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this divine dragon appeared in the real world, it would have been impossible for Heaven Wasteland Domain to accommodate such an enormous creature. It was simply unbelievable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Didn't you say there was only one dragon tooth?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why would... even the Dragon God be in the jade?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was shocked by this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he saw that, not only was there a huge divine dragon, but winding around the body of the divine dragon were wisps of blood mist that were almost imperceptible to the naked eye. These streaks of blood were the same as the strand of blood-coloured hair that stretched out from the crack on the [Northern Underworld Jade] before. It was impossible to notice without a closer look, but it was also upon a careful observation that one would find that the blood streaks were almost present everywhere, completely entangled with this huge dragon...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blood of the Demon Lord!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These ubiquitous wisps of blood were the blood of the Demon Lord.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A drop of blood that had been dried up for thousands of years had such terrifying power, able to seal and imprison such a huge dragon. Moreover, from the dragon's outer appearance, it looked extremely weak, almost without the slightest power to resist, and was quietly lying in the space of the [Northern Underworld Jade].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Jianru was right. The blood of the Demon Lord was too terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It can be imagined that, if this evil force was to break out from the space of the [Northern Underworld Jade] and into the real world, then Heaven Wasteland Domain would most likely be reduced to a dead domain. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Refine!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu roared, activating the [Supreme Ice Flame].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps it was because he was situated in the space of the [Northern Underworld Jade], with one thought, the [Supreme Ice Flame] had, like a silver ocean, flooded the whole space. It was countless times more powerful and violent than it was in the real world, producing wave-like howling. In an instant, it had already shrouded the gigantic dragon and the ubiquitous wisps of blood——&nbsp;</span></p>
