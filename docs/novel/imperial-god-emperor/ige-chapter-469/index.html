They attacked and defended as one, especially coordinated, as if they were of one body. The so called tool of fate, the [White Tiger Armour], was evidently much stronger than the black sword in the Old Commander's hand or the white rule in the hands of the Left Minister, Qu Hanshan. Furthermore, along with the fact that Lin Zheng, the Right Minister, was once known as the number one genius of Snow Empire, his cultivation was also stronger than Li Guangbi or Qu Hanshan.</span></p>

His entire chest was sunken in, and there were even white bones that jutted out from behind his back. His internal organs were nearly crushed into meat paste at that instant, fresh blood being spat out from his body. The strange power of the [White Tiger Armour] began madly and unrestrainedly running free within his body...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Old Commander Li Guangbi was also struck by a palm strike of Lin Zheng at his chest.

He shot through the air, receiving the bodies of the two directly from the skies.</span></p>

His white tiger palm covered the sky and sun, and was about to kill the two along with Ye Qingyu.</span></p>

The air surrounding him was as if there was a seal placed on it. The destructive killing intent held in that palm strike, with Ye Qingyu's current cultivation, unless he activated the [Limitless Divine Way] to a state above four limits, he had absolutely no way of blocking it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; And there was also the fact that he held two injured people in his embrace.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a faint light.</span></p>

Under the black night of the skies, there was a turbulent chaotic space that was hundreds of meters long, as if a piece of the skies had been lost that was frightening to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; At the same time, Ye Qingyu brought the two and returned to the ground.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "To think there was such an ability? To think it could instantly break apart from the lockdown of the qi of the [White Tiger Armour]? One must know that even a true Heaven Ascension stage expert, facing such a strike, will be heavily injured... it seems that in the body of this little Palace Lord, there are still many unknown secrets hidden on him..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As such a thought flashed by his mind, the gaze of the Right Minister, Lin Zheng stared down from the skies. He looked downwards towards the soldier camp as well as the people at the [Light Palace].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; A huge transparent white tiger figure changed along with the clouds and the night skies, shining above the skies of the capital.</span></p>

With an icy and judgemental gaze, it lay above the skies, coldly staring at the ground beneath and going to punish anyone that would dare go against it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; That humongous white tiger head caused everyone to feel insignificant and small.</span></p>

At that time, the Fiendgods from outside the domain will descend, and the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain will once again return to the God and Devil Age. Ye Qingyu, given the fact that you are a rarely seen genius of our Human Race, I will give you one last opportunity. Join me. After this day has passed, there will naturally be the glorious moment when your name resounds throughout Heaven Wasteland Domain. Otherwise, under the strike of my palm, you are but a piece of skeleton that turns into ashes. Even if you have a monstrous talent, it will still be wasted, and fated to be buried in the soil."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Lin Zheng opened his mouth, a toughness that did not allow for refusal in his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "There are things that one can do, but things that cannot do." Ye Qingyu told people to bring Qu Hanshan and Li Guangbi to be healed, while he lifted up his head and stared at the skinny and somewhat frail figure of the old man that was standing in the skies, like he was a Fiendgod. Wtih a faint smile, "Receiving the benefits of the Emperor, yet going against the kindness of your monarch. As the Minister of the Human Race, you betrayed humankind. I wonder just where your face and self-confidence comes from, that you want me to join you?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Lin Zheng heard this, but was not angered. He smiled, "Your vision is small. The Imperial family of Snow Empire, just how can it represent the entire Human Race of Heaven Wasteland Domain? When I joined the Imperial court, I was just like you--- I wanted to revitalize the Empire and bring glory to the humans of Heaven Wasteland Domain. But it's a pity the Yu Imperial family, from the Emperor the princes, are all incompetent people. They languish in court, not advancing even a step, failing the entire world. My heart acts for the Human Race wholeheartedly, but instead I receive the restriction imposed upon me by the Imperial family everywhere. If it is like so, then why not replace them."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Hearing this, Ye Qingyu activated his yuan power as well as the [Limitless Divine Way]. He continuously activated an even high level of divine limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; His aura was also currently rapidly rising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp;Lin Zheng couldn't help but sigh, saying again, "Ye Qingyu, if you give up on resisting, the elite troops and soldiers you have under you will be able to escape annihilation and can be preserved. Without resistance, there will be no killing. Your friends from all over will also be saved..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As Ye Qingyu heard this part, his complexion suddenly changed. With a thunderous rage, "What do you mean?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hearing of the way and character in which you do things, you are extremely protective. You will utterly protect the people close to you. In the past, for a couple of minor sentries in the sentry post of Youyan Pass that died in battle for you, you then used a multitude of methods to treat their families well. At White Deer Academy, there must be many of your close friends and fellow students, right? As for the Ye household in Deer City, oh, and those people in Youyan Pass, Lu Zhaoge and the others..."</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But the hint contained within this smile caused Ye Qingyu to have a rage and killing intent that was nearly unsuppressable at that instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Very evidently, the understanding the Right Minister, Lin Zheng, had towards Ye Qingyu was even deeper and more detailed than Ye Qingyu had imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "As the Right Minister, how could you do such shameless and despicable matters?" Ye Qingyu berated him angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In Ye Qingyu's entire life, the greatest inverted dragon's scale was this. If you touch it, he would absolutely be furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Right Minister let out a faint smile, "To achieve greater things, one must not mind the small things."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "You..." Ye Qingyu was furious, but could not utter anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Because he knew, someone like Lin Zheng was not a hero, he was a tyrant. To achieve something, he would entirely choose a method that did not care about the consequences or methods. These types of people were people that were truly terrifying and the most hard to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "I have heard that you have long established your own eyes and ears within the capital. The tiny little Two River Gang that is as small as a sesame seed in Deer City has begun to stretch it's vines towards the Snow Emperor. You can be counted as careful. But it’s a pity that no matter whether its Lang Zhong or Lang Yong, they are still too young and tender. Although they are talented, but just how could they compete against the forces that I have carefully cultivated in the last decades?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu's heart was even more shaken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He originally thought that the Two River Gang, having a faction within Snow Capital, was something that would remain utterly secret. Ever since coming to Snow Capital, he had only seen Lang Yong once, to prevent the intimate relationship between himself and the Two River Gang from being exposed. Ye Qingyu did not contact Lang Zhong, and Lang Zhong had only delivered some information through some extremely secretive methods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He did not imagine that the Two River Gang would still be exposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; People said the forces of the Right Minister in the entire empire was like a quicksilver pool. It would enter into any pore. From the current situation, such a description was indeed true. No matter whether it was Lang Zhong or Ye Qingyu himself, they had underestimated the enemy far too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Lin Zheng continued on with a faint smile, "When you arrive in the capital, you walked very closely with the Dugu family as well as the Ouyang family. Dugu Quan and Ouyang Buping, these two old foxes, wants to place a bet on you, and provided you with all sorts of help and services, as well as the Lin family... but do you know, that even if you were to die in battle here today, they will not feel the slightest hint of sadness for you. In fact, they will quickly reach a compromise with me, and change their direction, and willingly become a pawn under me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu deeply breath in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In front of him, countless experts of the sects began to advanced pressuringly. But because of the scene of the Right Minister, they had not yet launched an attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; And behind him, the hundreds of soldiers of the light camp was as somber as trees. There was not a hint of noise, stable like boulders as they guarded Ye Qingyu's back. At this time, there was no longer any of that sort of playfulness, pretending to be crazy and wanting treasures that were displayed at the camp. On the body of everyone, there was an iron-blooded, hard aura that had been cultivated through experiencing countless bloody battlefields and thousands of battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "What brother Ouyang and brother Dugu would choose, my heart is clear. Do you really think just by a couple of sentences of yours, you can affect the relationship between us? Although I am not as experienced as you Lin Zheng, I know how to read someone's heart, I know who to make friends with." Ye Qingyu suppressed the rage in his heart, saying word by word, "Furthermore, even if my two brothers had to submit to you, I have nothing against them. They have tens of thousands of people under their two great families, and blood is thicker than water. It is hard to discard all this away. To be forced to lower their heads to protect their families under your evil might is not something humiliating. I, Ye Qingyu, will absolutely not ask my two brothers, because of me, to risk the lives of thousands upon thousands of people of their two great families. Otherwise, this is true shamelessness. Then what difference will I have with you Lin Zheng?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As these words were said, a strange spiritual fluctuation was emitted from Ye Qingyu's body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This was an invisible, but still shocking energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu suddenly felt everything in his vision brightening. His chest that originally felt blocked and stuffed, was suddenly wide open. All the hesitation and confusion in his heart had been swept completely clear. There was no longer any dark clouds, as his will became unprecedentedly clear and determined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This was an elevation in his consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This was a purification and elevation of the power of his spiritual strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Such an elevation, for a martial expert, was absolutely an opportunity that one could only encounter in one's dream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; An outstanding martial cultivation needed to be concerned with having uncluttered thoughts and a clear will and determination. Like Ye Qingyu as he was previously, and being angered by several words of Lin Zheng, where his rage was hard to control. His inverted dragon's scale was also his weak point. Once he fell into this abyss, he would be bound by demons in his heart, and the path of his martial cultivation would become incomparably difficult.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But once he had thought this through, all the demons in his heart was instantly destroyed and extinguished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As for Ye Qingyu's martial cultivation, he would definitely make progress with much more ease, with a level path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But at this time, there was suddenly a heroic great laughter sounding from a distance away, "Good, very good. You are my brother Ye instead, life only has one great friend. Even if I die, what does it matter? Your brother I, have come..."</span></p>
