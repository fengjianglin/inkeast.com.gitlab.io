After receiving the news, many friendly forces and the representatives of merchant companies rushed over to offer their congratulations. Of course, there were also disciples of foreign races, who blended in with the crowd to watch the latest activity of Heaven Wasteland Domain.</span></p>

The border was decorated with simple but distinguishable dark gold markings, adding a solemn and unusual appearance to the stone building.&nbsp;</span></p>

Looking at Ye Qingyu again, there was unconsciously another trace of fear. Only one with true strength would feel the terror of the sword intent. The Madman Ye of rumours had improved his strength at a shockingly rapid speed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many forces that were interested in forming a friendly relationship with the Heaven Wasteland Domain also presented gifts.&nbsp;</span></p>

The appearance of the formation masters was a shock to the various forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone knew that, in the entire Heaven Connect City, there was only one person who could make the several Human Race formation masters appear at the same time, and that was Ren Puyang.</span></p>

The formations were al very mysterious and profound, and if activated at the same time, could resist the full blow of a Saint realm expert.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The whole process was also considered as gathering attention for Heaven Wasteland Building.</span></p>

He spent half a day in modifying and strengthening the formations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was done to maximize the protection of Heaven Wasteland Building as well as the experts stationed at the encampment. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although these masters were well respected and had the trust of Ren Puyang, Ye Qingyu had never met them before and so was naturally wary and cautious. In the formations that the masters had set up there must be a formation eye and a way to break the formation. The reason that he had modified the formations was to prevent the secret in breaking the formations falling into the hands of secret forces at the critical moment. After all, the infiltration ability of the top forces was extraordinary. The more in contact and integrated Ye Qingyu was with the great wide world, the more he was fearful. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Ye Qingyu’s knowledge in formations were derived from the intergenerational inheritance of the Formation Emperor Luosu, and was in no way inferior to that of the formation masters. Since he had personally taken care of the formation, after some repairs and with ten divine level liquid pills and ten chaotic thunder liquid pills as the core source of energy to drive the formation, the defense formation of Heaven Wasteland Building was brought to a higher level. It was impossible for even a Great Saint to break through the stone building.&nbsp;</span></p>

He then came forward to act as host and invited Lin Baichuan and Tang Chong, the two commanders of the white-robed divine guards, to Heaven Wasteland Building as guests. He formally introduced the Great Dragon Turtle Demon to the two high-ranking officers, with the obvious intent of relying on them to look after the Great Dragon Turtle Demon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two great white-robed divine guards wanted to form a good relationship with Ye Qingyu, who had limitless potential, so they also gave face to Ye Qingyu and quickly got acquainted with the Great Dragon Turtle Demon.</span></p>

The next morning he said farewell to the Great Dragon Turtle Demon, and directly left the Heaven Wasteland Building along with Luo Yi, Little Nine, and Mother Qin Hui and her son, setting foot on the road to the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>

There was not a blade of grass across the vast desert, only the blowing sand soaring into the sky. Fierce winds were converging and rumbling like waves, and the entire heavens was dim and dark.</span></p>

Perhaps it was much more glorious in the past. The ruins far and near gave the impression that many years ago the buildings here were not so simple, but now it had deteriorated to a state beyond recognition. The majority of the collapsed buildings were buried by yellow sand, and only a few small stone buildings were still standing among the wind and sand.&nbsp;</span></p>

In the main hall there were only a few rocks stacked together casually. Even the only remaining door had long been eroded by the wind and sand, leaning against the doorframe, teetering.&nbsp;</span></p>

There was not even a blade of grass across the land and rock formations. In particular, most of the grounds were cracked. The winding cracks were extended all over the land, mountains and rivers. There was faint hot air emitting from thousands of meters deep. It was as though someone had struck the land with a huge axe, and across the desert, where the heaven and earth met, there were countless volcanoes, heat waves billowing into the sky, seemingly about to erupt, and the lava had already overflowed the land. It was like hell.&nbsp;</span></p>

The Ancient Sky Dragon Sect that had occupied the entire Ancient Sky Dragon Domain was comparable to the major sects such as the Jade Pearl Sect and Tianqian Sect. It had awe-inspiring authority, and for a long period of time, the roars of the Sky Dragon cannon on the Sky Dragon battleships had made countless enemies shiver in fear...</span></p>

The present Ancient Sky Dragon Domain, because the spiritual qi of the Heaven and earth had been exhausted, because of the negligence of the Ancient Sky Dragon Race, because... because of various reasons, was like a tottering old man, aged with years and was about to reach the end of its life yuan.&nbsp;</span></p>

What he had seen along the way had confirmed all kinds of rumours. The present Ancient Sky Dragon Domain indeed, as the rumours had said, did not have the vitality of the past. The environment had deteriorated to an extreme state, and all kinds of natural resources were almost depleted. It was only waiting for death and destruction to come.&nbsp;</span></p>
