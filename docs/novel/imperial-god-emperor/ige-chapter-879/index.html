They did not exude the slightest vitality, and the door of their cell had also collapsed into a pool of shattered ice with a loud rumble. The whole cell had become silent and there was no longer the slightest defensive force.&nbsp;</span></p>

As for the supervising officials who were put into an important position because of the slaughter of loyal disciples, before the look of shock had faded from their faces they were already turned into ice statues. The disciples who thought they were going to be executed and had their eyes closed for a good while finally opened their eyes to see that everything around them had become ice crystal sculptures, and snowflakes flurried past, cutting off their handcuffs...&nbsp;</span></p>

The snow continued to fall, and this heavy snow would provide the people of the city with water for at least three months. As for the problem of food.....Ye Qingyu could not take care of so many matters. After all, he was not a God, he could not solve everything. As for how they were going to survive in the future, it would have to rely on Zhang Ye and the others.&nbsp;</span></p>

She was looking forward to arriving in Ancient Sky Dragon City, avenging her father and for the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect will return to how it was before. But there was a complex look in her eyes because even so, the fate of the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain was still irreversible, and it would eventually die. The Ancient Sky Dragon Sect would also not last for much longer. And without the support of an expert like Ye Qingyu, it would only be a matter of time before it was destroyed. &nbsp;</span></p>

Moreover, it seemed that the Origin crystals and rare materials of the entire Ancient Sky Dragon Domain had been gathered in this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the oldest, the most majestic and largest city in the history of Ancient Sky Dragon Domain, it had begun to develop in the beginning stages of the birth of the domain, and had been continuously expanding and improving over the past millions of years. To this day, palaces, pavilions and various architectures of various periods could be found throughout the giant city. The city was incredibly rich in history, and could be said to be a microcosm of the development of the Human Race in the Great Thousand Domains.</span></p>

Qin Hui's expression grew a bit complicated, while Little Ning'er looked a bit timid, burying his head in his mother's arms.&nbsp;</span></p>

His first reaction was naturally fear.</span></p>

It looked solemn and exquisite.</span></p>

Thus, in order to maximize the preservation of yuan qi, experts would rarely fly with yuan qi other than in combat.</span></p>

There were hundreds of experts of the Human Race, and the majority was of the Heaven Ascension realm, and a few who looked older were around the Immortal Step realm.&nbsp;</span></p>

His ash-grey beard was like a halberd, brows like broadsword, eyes bright and shining, and had a powerful and imposing aura. His strength was at the pinnacle of the Immortal Step realm, and there was a faint fiendish qi surging all over his body. &nbsp;</span></p>

Logically speaking, given the speed at which news spread, it was absolutely impossible for it to arrive faster than them. Then how did these people know about their arrival? And they obviously had accurately calculated the time, and knew when they would come to Ancient Sky Dragon City and thus have been waiting here already.&nbsp;</span></p>

Ye Qingyu was a little puzzled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu calmly nodded in response.&nbsp;</span></p>

After seeing you today, you really are young and promising and have an extraordinary presence. You will certainly have a brilliant future.” Elder Cang Li's eyes flashed, and from the remark it sounded like he greatly admired Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Mother Qin Hui and her son behind Ye Qingyu, Elder Cang Li simply ignored them like he did not know them. Even the death of Elder Ming Jue and the affairs in Yu Leaf City seemed to have never happened.</span></p>

With the wave of his hand, he motioned everyone to retreat, before he said, “Lord Ye Qingyu, the Patriarch is in the main hall of Sky Dragon Mountain, looking forward to your arrival. He especially told us to wait here to show Lord Ye Qingyu into the city. Lord Ye Qingyu, please go ahead.”&nbsp;</span></p>

It looked beautiful and imposing, and from its style it seemed that back then the carriage was pulled by Sky Horses. However after the domain began to decline, Sky Horses also went extinct, and were replaced by the red treasure horse. Even so, it was still incredibly rare to see a horse-pulled carriage in Ancient Sky Dragon Domain, where materials were incredibly scarce. &nbsp;</span></p>
