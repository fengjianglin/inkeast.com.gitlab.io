 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu did not move and conserved his energy as he waited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Nine jumped from his shoulder and retreated a few steps until it was right beside the corpse of the retired emperor of the Dragon Human Race. Its gaze roved around and it barked out, "Woof. Master, you must put up a good fight. I will guard this body on your behalf, don't you worry…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you dare to eat his body, I'll make sure that you go hungry for a year." Ye Qingyu replied without even sparing him a glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Nine was stunned, then he exclaimed in annoyance, "Master, is this what you think of me? Woof. What about the loyalty of a dog to its master?" It lay down on its stomach, a picture of distress. In reality, it was weighing the pros and cons of eating this half-step to a Quasi-emperor corpse against having to starve for an entire year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu ignored him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The five Saint experts opposite him were only a hundred steps away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's gaze swept past those five Saints and looked toward the quiet figures in the distance. These people were all clad in black-hooded cloaks that masked their features, and thus he was unable to identify them. However, he was sure that they were not weaklings. He knew that they must have been well-prepared since they had laid out this plan beforehand. They probably had a plan to counter his trump card, the [Red Lotus Hellfire].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This battle was bound to be very tough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Ye Qingyu was also not the same person that he had been in Falcon City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The miraculous encounter in the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain had caused his strength to surge significantly, especially his physical strength. It was now close to the Grand Completion. He now had the strength to go up against a Great Saint, so those people who were only in the Saint realm were nothing to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's lips curved into a smile at the thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He ignored the five Saints who charged at him, and his gaze fell like lightning, with a flash of iciness and killing intent, on Huang Tayun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Tayun felt Ye Qingyu's gaze on him. He stiffened, then his expression changed when he realized what was about to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he could even move, everyone felt their vision go blurry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silver light from the Void flickered and Ye Qingyu suddenly disappeared without a trace. Those five Saints exclaimed in surprise but they were unable to stop him, for his figure seemed to have merged with the Void. He disappeared from where he was standing, and they could not detect any trace of his aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Astonishment filled the eyes of these five Saints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before they even moved to attack him, they had used their Saintly qi activity to lock in on Ye Qingyu. Even the most-expert fleeing technique would not be able to break free from their Saintly qi activity. Yet, Ye Qingyu had managed to make the impossible possible, and had truly managed to disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next moment—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A silver splendor twinkled in the Void beside Huang Tayun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu emerged from the splendor. His right palm was twisted in the shape of a claw and he reached out to grab Huang Tayun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You must be courting death… [Twilight Moon Broken Ax], break it!" Huang Tayun bellowed and his Saint qi surged all around him. Countless formations then transformed into the shape of a vicious wolf, and a broken ax with a mysterious glow appeared in his hand. He swung this ax that contained a piercingly sharp killing force at Ye Qingyu's claw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one expected Ye Qingyu not to dodge the blow as he allowed the mysterious broken ax to slash at his claw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Clang! Clang!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a loud metallic clang when the ax hit his claw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As sparks flew everywhere, several cracks appeared on the blade of the broken ax and it was immediately knocked backward. Huang Tayun felt a tremendous force surging toward him and his grip loosened on the broken ax as blood spurted out. He lost his grip on this broken ax and was sent flying….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was almost as good as dead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This [Twilight Moon Broken Ax] had been a half-Emperor weapon but it was then downgraded to a Saint weapon because it was broken. Nonetheless, it was extremely sharp and had the ability to cut gold and break jade. His master had bestowed this weapon unto him as a reward in recognition of his outstanding contributions. He knew that even a Great Saint could not face this weapon head-on, but he had not expected Ye Qingyu's palm to be as hard as divine gold. Cracks even appeared on his broken ax…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Smack!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a loud slap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Ye Qingyu's claw turned back into a palm, he gave Huang Tayun a resounding backhand slap and the latter blacked out. He felt like he had been hit by a mighty hammer on the right side of his face. Everything became a blur, his face lost all feeling and several broken teeth flew out of his mouth. He was thrown back like a tattered sack and flew toward the Third Princess and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How audacious."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Over there…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Charge!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once again, the five Saints locked in on Ye Qingyu and moved as fast as lightning to attack, with no reprieve at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"[Walking on the Void]," Ye Qingyu growled without even turning back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silver splendor of the Void flashed once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next instant, his figure disappeared into the Void in the exact same manner as before, and once again, no one could detect a trace of his aura. These five Saints had moved quickly but he had disappeared even before their attacks could hit him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How can this be?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were completely stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How can this be?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Third Princess of the Dragon Human Race, Huang Tayun, who was still sailing through the air, and the others exclaimed in unison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had appeared in front of the Third Princess almost instantly after he disappeared before the attacks from the five Saints could hit him. Once more, his palm turned into a claw and he pressed his claw downward. His movement seemed slow, but in reality, it was extremely fast. The Third Princess felt a mighty force surging at her and she was unable to block it at all. Then, his palm landed on her head and an icy force welled up to completely seal all the strength within her. He flung her aside. The Void rippled and flashed, then the Third Princess fell into the ripple just like a rock being thrown into a pond. The ripples spread, then she disappeared from view…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Tayun had only sailed in midair for around a dozen meters and had arrived where the Third Princess had been, but he had yet to crash to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu gave him another backhand slap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Smack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was another resounding slap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Tayun was not in any position to retaliate at all and he was slapped on the other side of his face. This smack was so forceful that it changed the shape of his skull. He rotated madly in midair like a windmill and he was sent flying in the opposite direction. Blood spurted crazily through the air and he flew for a hundred meters before he crashed to the ground next to the retired emperor's corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Simultaneously, the Void in front of Little Nine flashed and ripples appeared.</span></p>
