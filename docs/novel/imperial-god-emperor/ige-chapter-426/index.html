 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　But thinking of the forces that wanted to kill him, all sorts of methods began to be used. There was ultimately someone who really fooled everyone, and managed to deliver poison into his mouth. Thinking of the methods and power at such a person's disposal, there was cold sweat coming from Ye Qingyu's back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　But he did not mention this matter to other people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　As time passed, there were all sorts of killing methods and assassinations attempted that targeted Ye Qingyu. In the blink of an eye, another three months had already passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　In this half a year, Ye Qingyu had already gotten used to all kinds of killing attempts that would suddenly appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Thanks to the Spirit monkey companion blocking it, as well as the protection of the [Supreme Ice Flame], every assassination attempt was like rumbling thunder. It seemed dangerous every time, but every time he was able to survive without any harm being done to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　When Ye Qingyu was bored, he had counted how many of such attempts there were.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　If not for the protection of the Spirit monkey statue, he would have died at least twenty-five times already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Slowly, Ye Qingyu began to understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Such assassination attempts were not only because they tageting him. It was that others wanted to use such a method to test the [Light Palace], to test the Spirit monkey battle companion, or even to test the Lord that had disappeared for a hundred years. The shadow left in the hearts of people by the [Light Palace] was really too large. Even now, if they wanted to act, there were still apprehension in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Ye Qingyu also began to grow used to such days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Apart from giving advice and direction to his four disciples in name everyday, Ye Qingyu did not care about the other matters of the [Light Palace].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　For Liu Jingyan as well as the other Envoys of Light that had been previously appointed, everything seemed to have returned to the laziness and leisurely state of the past. The imagined thunderous discipline that would arrive because Ye Qingyu was a newly appointed officer did not arrive. The big fatty military officer, who was originally fearful and apprehensive, also relaxed a lot more. Seeing the newly appointed Lord of the Light Palace did not blame him for being so undisciplined with his soldiers, there were faint sounds of wagering and gambling that again sounded out within the practice grounds of the second area in these couple of days...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　 The newly appointed Envoy of Light, Wen Wan, was not any different from these old hands. The entire day he had nothing to do, and very quickly became firm friends with Liu Jingyan and Dai Youmeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Originally, Yan Hengshui was a military officer at the borders. He had ambition in his heart, and always wanted to achieve something great. But it was a pity that he was suppressed and isolated by his foolish superior, his talent unable to be fully demonstrated. There were even times that he had nearly died, and he had been assigned to guard the provisions. The passion in his heart gradually died down as a result of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　The previous Lord of the Light Palace went to the border frontier and encountered Yan Hengshui. Seeing his remarkable strength for his young age, he had paid careful attention. After observing for a while, he returned to the capital and immediately placed an order for Yan Hengshui to be transferred into the [Light Palace], and become an Envoy of Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　If it was in terms of strength alone, then the Yan Hengshui at that time was only at the seventy Spirit springs cultivation. The reason that the previous Lord of the Light Palace decided to favour him was that he wanted to raise him into his close confidant. The other was that he had no choice; after all, the [Light Palace] had been in a long state of decay. There were already very little experts at the level of Yan Hengshui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　But such an appointment had shaken the borders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　The incompetent superior that had once made things difficult for Yan Hengshui, after learning about this appointment, was nearly scared to death. He thought that Yan Hengshui had connections within the capital, and scrammed over to apologize, allowing for Yan Hengshui to vent his vicious frustration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Yan Hengshui was excited, thinking that the opportunity for him to display his talents had finally arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Who would have guessed, that only after entering the [Light Palace] did Yan Hengshui discover that everything was different from his imaginations. The [Light Palace] was just a title in name without power. He had only switched places, he was still an insignificant minor character...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　The Yan Hengshui whose heart had grown cold, spent the large majority of his time immersed in the martial path, practicing like he was mad everyday.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Perhaps it was because he had stilled his heart and had no worries or ambitions, but it had a miraculous effect. In less than ten years of time, he took a step that many peak stage Spirit spring experts were unable to do so; he entered into the Bitter Sea stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　 Ye Qingyu had entered into the Light Palace and he had caused such a commotion. It caused there to be a shred of hope to rise within Yan Hengshui's originally still heart. Who would have thought that in these months Ye Qingyu would have no actions and remain where he was, making him grow disappointed yet again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　The other envoy of light &nbsp;Li Changheng, was originally the eldest son of a middle class noble family in the capital. Originally, he had significant status, and adding to this his exceptional martial talent, he was once one of the famous noble young masters of the capital. But it was a pity a transformation occurred. His fiance that he deeply loved broke apart their marriage contract to become one of the Thirteen Bloody Eagles of the Right Minister...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Li Changheng suffered a setback, and wanted to fight back. But the power of the Right Minister was too vast, it was not something his family could compete with. He was humiliated and laughed at, nearly causing his family to break apart and perish...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　The he who had suffered an injury of the heart gradually grew silent. Ultimately, he drifted apart from his circle of friends, becoming a decent laughing stock in the capital. Two years ago he directly went to the [Light Palace] and became one of the Envoys of Light. With alcohol as his companion, he gradually dimmed out of sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Thankfully, due to his excellent martial talent and deep cultivation, and for the fact that he had often been forced to practice with the little martial madman Yan Hengshui, his martial cultivation had not fallen much in these two years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　These two people both had their misfortunes and injuries in their heart. They had come to the [Light Palace] to escape from their wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Seeing Ye Qingyu's performance, their hearts also quickly grew cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　But Wen Wan and Ximen Yeshui were people who acted familiar with you no matter what. Even if Yan Hengshui and Li Changheng were somewhat solitary, they could ultimately not avoid the entanglement of the two and gradually became friends with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Of course, there was still Little Nine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　After receiving the identity as the beloved pet of the Lord, he abused this position incessantly. This was especially so for the soldiers of the Light Camp, they were unendingly abused by Little Nine...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　There was a massive change that occured in the [Light Palace], but in reality, it could be said that nothing had changed whatsoever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　The outer world that had been paying attention to the movements of the [Light Palace] also gradually relaxed their surveillance. They realized that the imagined thunderous restructuring had not arrived, and the Divine Sword of Light that shot towards the heavens was only an image.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Four months later, the conversations that were invoked by Ye Qingyu bringing the [Light Palace] back to life slowly died down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　Ye Qingyu had already felt this was strange. After he suddenly became the Lord of the Light Palace, the legendary Crown Prince had never appeared. Perhaps the situation made this next in line to be the Emperor somewhat disappointed. He originally expected for Ye Qingyu to become a great aid fo him, but who would have guessed he would be trapped in the [Light Palace], becoming a useless chess piece.</span></p>

The formation that was crawled out by the Silver snake that came from the palace was incomparably deep and profound. It could draw in the earth fire from within the sword pit, and purify the fire poison from within the Earth Fire, and become somewhat heterogeneous yuan qi power. After the purification of the stone chair, stone table and stone bed, such a power had become extremely filtered and could finally be absorbed for martial cultivation.</span></p>

Aftering sitting on it, it could instantly make Ye Qingyu enter into the most optimum cultivating state. There was no flaws as he activated his cultivation technique, and even his ability to comprehend was boosted. He could enter a strange spirit state at any moment.</span></p>

When he used his consciousness to use inner vision, he could see everything within the desert dantian world. With the hundred springs in his heart, small creeks of water where spreading about like a strong vine, encroaching around the surroundings.</span></p>

It he could connected the creek waters, if he could completely merge the eyes of the hundred Spirit springs together so that the creeks would widen, the flow of the water would quicken, and mist would spread, the water qi nourishing the two edges, then he would succeed. At that time, a creek would become a stream, and a stream would become a great river. At that time, he could be said to have entered into the River stage of the Bitter Sea stage. &nbsp;</span></p>
