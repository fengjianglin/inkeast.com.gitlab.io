 <p>349 - Important figures</p>
 <p>When Ye Qingyu conversed with the others, Lin Baiyi stood silently by the side, helping them pour wine and carrying the dishes.</p>
 <p>This little Pill God that had become famed in the recent years had a famous master and also had exceptional talent. His martial cultivation was also very powerful, and he was originally one of the movers and shakers within the younger generation of the Empire. In these months, the Pill formula he brought out for the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet] had shaken the entire Empire.</p>
 <p>Although Lin Baiyi had never personally admitted that he had personally created the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet], but since the old Pill God had denied that the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet] had been made by him, the other people had guessed that this pill that could increase one's yuan qi cultivation without any side effects, must originate from the hands of Lin Baiyi.</p>
 <p>Because of the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet], Lin Baiyi and the Lin family behind him became scorching hot within the entire Empire.</p>
 <p>Of course, what was also scorchingly popular, was the Hundred Herb Hall who had received the exclusive right to sell the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet].</p>
 <p>Within the capital, apart from the three main lists that Dugu Quan had brought out, there was in truth also a [Hidden Dragon List]. It recorded the talents with limitless potential within Snow Capital. And Lin Baiyi was within top three. Dugu Quan had not mentioned the [Hidden Dragon List] to Ye Qingyu, because he had subconsciously regarded Ye Qingyu as his equal. From the perspective of the Pill God, the so called hidden dragons were not even worth mentioning in front of Ye Qingyu so he had not paid any attention to it.</p>
 <p>If others saw Lin Baiyi, who was ranked number three in the [Hidden Dragon List], being so respectful to someone who was even younger than him, their jaws must drop to the ground.</p>
 <p>The three conversed till it was deep in the night.</p>
 <p>"Haha, it's late. Let's call it a day here." Dugu Quan let out a laugh, then looked at Ye Qingyu with a strange expression. "Little Brother, the glory of Snow Capital can only be experienced when it is night time. If you are interested, why not let Baiyi lead you. Haha, we two are old, so we won't come with you to enjoy."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was taken aback.</p>
 <p>Lin Baiyi instantly stood up. "If Ye Shishu is interested, then I would be honoured."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked at the mischievous eyes of these two old men, and suddenly understood, what they meant by the glory of the Snow Capital. His heart was faintly moved; after all he was a young man. But after a thought, he ultimately shook his head, "It's fine, I've only just arrived in Snow Capital after a long journey. I'll first take a rest, there will be more opportunities in the future."</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>That night, Ye Qingyu stayed within the [Medicine Hut].</p>
 <p>After making arrangements for Ximen Yeshui, Wen Wan and the others, Ye Qingyu returned to his own room.</p>
 <p>He did not feel sleepy at all in the first night in Snow Capital.</p>
 <p>After all, when someone’s strength had reached a state like his, it did not matter if they did not sleep or rest. He only needed to occasionally activate his yuan qi, and his body would reach its most optimal condition.</p>
 <p>Under the light of the silver formation light, Ye Qingyu took out the seven coloured jade piece.</p>
 <p>Regarding the matters of the three main lists, Ye Qingyu had in truth already seen the news from the Two River Gang on the way here. He had even seen the [Hidden Dragon List]. But Ye Qingyu still wanted to compare the information he had obtained from Dugu Quan to the information obtained from the Two River Gang. Dugu Quan was a respected figure within the entire capital, would the list he brought out be any different to the list he obtained from other means.</p>
 <p>"[Heavenly Officer List]. It records the supreme existences amongst the Imperial officials, those with revered positions, those nobles and officers with endless power and wealth. These people have the right to kill, or they have countless experts under their command, or they have revered bloodlines, or their wits are astounding, or they are experts that are deeply hidden. Every one of them are a vicious character within the Empire..."</p>
 <p>This was the approximate description at the beginning of the [Heavenly Officer List].</p>
 <p>On the [Heavenly Officer List], the number one ranking was not the siblings of the Emperor, nor the princes of the Empire, but it was a great character that Ye Qingyu had heard mentioned countless of times---</p>
 <p>The Right Minister, Lin Zheng.</p>
 <p>As for this Right Minister, his name had a 'Zheng' inside it. According to rumours, no matter what it was, whether it was of use to him or not, this Right Minister would go compete for it. And he would gain what he desired everytime he competed for it, but his opponent would always have a tragic ending every time.</p>
 <p>He had originated from a great noble family, but he was not the main successor. Ultimately, he sat in the Right Minister that represented the pinnacle of the Empire's power, and he sat there for an entire forty years, like a boulder. No matter how the winds blew or how the rains fell in the Empire, his position could not be shaken. In these forty years, his power had extended like tentacles to every corner of every province, and he had became a minister that stood above everyone else in the Empire. As long you mentioned the name the Right Minister, Lin Zheng, these four words were enough to make anyone shiver in the capital.</p>
 <p>Including the Snow Emperor.</p>
 <p>Under the Right Minister, the number two on the [Heavenly Officer List] was the apex Prince of the Empire, Yu Feiyan.</p>
 <p>As the apex Prince of the Empire, Yu Feiyan had the blood of the Imperial family running in his body. He was the younger brother of the current Snow Emperor, and he was one of the three main mountains of the military department. He had stunning battle records, and his power was also exquisite. There were countless experts under his command, and he commanded one of the four main armies of the army, the [Scarlet Flame Army]. There was an Excusing Death Medal and a Dragon Penalty Sword in his hands, he had the power to first execute and then judge all those under a second class Marquis. His power could be described as completely shrouding the heavens.</p>
 <p>"These characters really cannot be provoked. With the Dragon Penalty Sword in their hands, killing a noble Marquis was just like cutting apart a vegetable to them." Seeing this, Ye Qingyu could not help but sigh in amazement. What made him even more amazed was that an apex prince like Yu Feiyan seemed to be suppressed by the Right Minister. From this, one could see just how far the power of the Right Minister extended.</p>
 <p>As for who was ranked number three, it was another huge figure within the army. He was called, Li Xianhu.</p>
 <p>Commander Li was one of the oldest generals of the officers who had founded Snow Empire. He had already past several hundreds of years old, and commanded one of the four main armies of the Empire, called the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] army. He was also the teacher of the Youyan War God, Lu Zhaoge. Today, he very rarely interferred in the conflicts within the army. But as the saying goes, an old stallion in the stables still aspires to gallop a thousand miles. His words still had an incomparable power.</p>
 <p>Under him, ranked number fourth, was the current Crown Prince, Yu Hualong.</p>
 <p>Under the Crown Prince, only until the tenth position, was the Left Minister Qu Hanshan.</p>
 <p>Although Dugu Quan and Ouyang Buping had denied such a thing, but Ye Qingyu was still able to see the names of these two old men on the [Heavenly Officer List]. They were ranked number eleven and number fifteen, and seemed amazing and fearful people. Especially Dugu Quan, his position was only second to the Left Minister yet he had the nerve to call himself harmless.</p>
 <p>There were in total a hundred places on the [Heavenly Officer List].</p>
 <p>There seemed to be many people on the lists, ut these were the top hundred people of the millions of the Snow Capital. Even the person ranked hundredth was an amazing person.</p>
 <p>As for the [Heavenly Officer List] recorded within the seven coloured jade piece, it was slightly different from the list given by the Two River Gang. The ranking of several people were above or below, evidently the list given by Dugu Quan was more authoritative.</p>
 <p>After all, Dugu Quan was a person that belonged to the true upper echelon within Snow Capital. The Two River Gang on the other hand had only developed for several years, so its foundation was still weak.</p>
 <p>Reading the section of the [Heavenly Officer List], Ye Qingyu opened the [Divine Dragon List].</p>
 <p>This list recorded the rankings of the martial experts of the Snow Capital. The person ranked number one was the [Martial Madman], Hu Yu. He was an existence at the Heaven Ascension stage, and was exceedingly terrifying. He was a person that was crazily in love with the martial path. He had entered into the capital fifty years ago, and stunned the Snow Capital for fifty years. He had thousands of small and large battles, and had never suffered defeat. It was said he could be ranked in the top three within the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain.</p>
 <p>The person ranked number two was the Chang Princess, Yu Junqing.</p>
 <p>The third was the [Meteor Shower Sword], Liu Xing of the Imperial group of masters.</p>
 <p>The apex prince Yu Feiyan was ranked twenty.</p>
 <p>The Right Minister, Lin Zheng, was ranked number thirty eight.</p>
 <p>Qu Hanshan, the Left Minister, was ranked number ten.</p>
 <p>Dugu Quan and Ouyang Buping were also on the list, but their position was in the lower ranks. After all, they had completely immersed themselves in the Pill and Medicinal arts. Martial cultivation was not the direction they focused on. To be able to be in the [Divine Dragon List] was already something that made Ye Qingyu surprised.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu instantly realized that the last person on the list of the [Divine Dragon List], the [Merciless Blade], He Lijun was a Bitter Sea stage Expert.</p>
 <p>In other words, only those who had cultivated to the Bitter Sea stage, had the requirements to enter this list.</p>
 <p>As for the [Black Fiend List], it recorded down some people in the gangs as well as the darker path. Some in the ranking were groups, while some were people’s names. Comparatively, it was a bit more chaotic. Ye Qingyu had a large approximate look and remembered the number one ranked [Thunderbolt Hall], the second ranked [Yin Yang Monarch] and the third ranked [Brothel].</p>
 <p>"This [Yin Yang Monarch] should be the person that I met in the palace of the [Formation Sovereign] Luo So. Who would have thought that he would be in the Snow Capital, and had such great fame. This really is an unexpected surprised. At a crucial time, perhaps he could be of use to me."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was pleasantly surprised.</p>
 <p>As for the [Hidden Dragon list], Ye Qingyu only had a cursory look and did not pay too much attention.</p>
 <p>After looking at the several lists, Ye Qingyu closed the window and sat on a meditative position on the bed. He began the cultivation training that he did every night.</p>
 <p>As the nameless breathing technique activated, his entire person quickly entered a state of blankness.</p>
 <p>The night was long.</p>
 <p>"Eh? This is strange. The speed of cultivation within the Snow Capital seems to be much quicker than on the outside. Even in the den of the Snow Dragons, such a scene had never appeared.”</p>
 <p>After an hour, Ye Qingyu opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>There was a strange confusion in his eyes.</p>
 <p>In his first cultivation training at Snow Capital, Ye Qingyu could sense that the speed at which the nameless breathing technique absorbed the yuan qi of the world was faster than normal by tens of times. Even at the cemetery of the Snow dragons, when he was absorbing the aura of the Snow Dragon, it could not reach such a speed.</p>
 <p>Such a feeling was like he was sitting on a yuan qi energy ocean. He only needed to casually breathe in, and there would be energy entering into his body.</p>
 <p>What was happening?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu clearly felt and sensed, but he could not discover anything.</p>
 <p>If he did not activate the nameless breathing technique, this strange yuan qi multiplicative growth would disappear.</p>
 <p>It was extremely bizarre.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu felt nonplussed.</p>
 <p>Perhaps others would also have such a feeling when cultivating?</p>
 <p>Or perhaps it was only he himself?</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The next day.</p>
 <p>Dugu Quan and Ouyang Buping brought along some friends, and introduced them to Ye Qingyu...</p>
