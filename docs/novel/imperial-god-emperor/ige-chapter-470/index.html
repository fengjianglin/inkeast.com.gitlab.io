There was evidently some sort of hidden formation energy shield that had been destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there were thousands of black figures that were like bolts of lightning in the night that rushed over like a gust of wind from far off.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The person that previously spoke was namely the Pill God of Snow Empire, Dugu Quan.</span></p>

Dugu Quan flew in the sky and laughed greatly, "To be able to have a sworn brother like you in my later years, my wishes have really been completely fulfilled. Today, I will fight shoulder to shoulder with you, if it's a mountain then we'll climb over, if its fire then we'll prevail over it together."</span></p>

We came to provide support too late, don't blame us brother Ye. Thankfully, there was the aid of the Sword King Qin, as well as other brothers of the Jianghu, so we were able to break the encirclement and rush here. We were able to hear such morale rousing words from far away, I am ashamed..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; One was known as the Pill God and one was known as the Divine Doctor. These were not martial titles that were not renowned throughout the Empire. But this did not represent they were not martial experts. In fact, this was entirely the opposite. The martial cultivation of the two was also extremely profund. They had entered into the Bitter Sea stage a hundred years ago, so their cultivation today was even more unfathomable than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; And behind them, there were roughly thousands of people. They were all martial experts, the large majority of them covered in blood. Evidently, to get to here, they had experienced a path of killing and had paid a significant price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Xiu!Xiu!Xiu!</span></p>

They stood shoulder in shoulder with the soldiers of the [Light Palace].</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; These days he had a huge disturbance within Snow Capital, causing the movement of all forces. He was the successor of the [Matchless Blade City] that people had been chasing to kill. Compared to the previous noble and handsome young master appearance that he had at the Xian Pavilion at Youyan Pass, there was a huge transformation. He seemed to have grown older, without the previous white complexion and aura he had before. But his eyes had grown sharper, with his eyebrows nearly touching his temple, making him look even more unmatchedly heroic than before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; A scar had appeared on his left face, the colour extremely pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But with Qin Wushuang's cultivation, for there to be a scar to be left on his face and not be able to be erased, one could see just how terrifying his initial injuries were. One could tell just what sort of heart pounding experiences he had gone through in Snow Capital, he must have been in battle at every moment in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Next to him, there were around twenty experts also wearing flame-like armour. They should all be experts that originated from the [Matchless Blade City]. Every one of them had a deep aura and serious expressions, not in any way lesser than that of the soldiers of the Light camp. Evidently, they were a little platoon of elites that had undergone hundreds of battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "The fame of brother Qin has shaken Snow Captial in these days. Seeing you today, your radiance is definitely better than in the past and your cultivation has progressed even further. Congratulations." Ye Qingyu let out a loud laughter, directly giving Qin Zhishui an embrace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu had incomparable admiration for this successor of the [Matchless Blade City].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; If amongst the Three Sects and Three Schools,there were any loyal sects, then the [Matchless Blade City] would definitely be at the forefront. And if there were any loyal warriors amongst the Three Sects and Three Schools, then the [Matchless Blade King] Qin Wushuang would absolutely be at the forefront.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This was a true iron-blooded man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; His pride was as if it had been created by the world.</span></p>

They are all warriors that are loyal to the empire. Previously, the Old Commander had hiddenly contacted them before. But it’s a pity that old bastard Lin Zheng is too sly and crafty. Before he attacked the [Light Palace], he left behind his underlings to surrounded us, so we had to break through the heavy encirclement. Before we came here, we already lost over 50 percent of our manpower." Qin Zhishui continued to introduce the Jianghu people that he brought over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Brothers, it's been hard.”</span></p>

Please give us orders and tell us what to do."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's right, today let's immediately fight and kill here today."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The surrounding people were after all people of the Jianghu. They did not have the strict discipline of the army. Therefore when they heard Ye Qingyu words, all began shouting and yelling. Although they were somewhat scattered, but at least from their performance, they were as passionate as fire, with high morale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; At this time, Ye Qingyu did not know what arrangements to make for these people.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even if they spent this thousand of people to expend the yuan qi of Lin Zheng, it would not have too great of an effect because Lin Zheng was wearing the [White Tiger Armour]. Furthermore, even if it could really expend a portion of Lin Zheng's power, Ye Qingyu would not use such a bloody method. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Furthermore, the Jianghu power under the commander of the Right Minister was posturing threateningly opposite them. Their number was not in any way least than theirs.</span></p>

There were several Heaven Ascension stage experts that had appeared, and finally even the Right Minister Lin Zheng had personally appeared. Even if one did not use a brain to think, one could be sure that it was definitely not because Lin Zheng really hated the [Light Palace] or because of Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was something that he had not expected, that before Li Guangbi had gone to battle, he had arranged such a way to give the [Light Palace] some external support. But the problem was, would such a ragtag crowd really be of use? Could they really bring a shred of hope to the [Light Palace]?</span></p>

The [White Tiger Armour] protected him like a silver star screen. In but a breath's time, he heavily struck the [Flowing Silver Light Formation] that had not yet entirely collapsed. In an instant, the protective light barrier of the formation was entirely destroyed, and he struck down like a bolt of lightning into the crowd below.</span></p>

There were several experts that attempted to block him, but as he listed his hand, they were all turned into ashes. The White Tiger spirit lay on his shoulder, the silver light of his yuan qi emitting from his sword. The long tail of the tiger was like a divine whip curling in the air. There was absolutely no expert who could even enter ten meters near him.</span></p>

The [Matchless Blade King], Qin Zhishui took a look and instantly knew it would be troublesome.

They could not even endure for a significant period of time.</span></p>
