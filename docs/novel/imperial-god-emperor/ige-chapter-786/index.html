All of a sudden she found it difficult to contain her anger. Back when the Little Princess was in the 18th district the Saintess of the ade Pearl Sect had plotted against her, and she was suppressed into the seven-star tombstone and almost died. What the Little Princess felt towards her could be described as deep hatred. Therefore, she wanted to tear the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect to pieces and consequently hated the Jade Pearl Sect and vowed to kill all of its people.&nbsp;</span></p>

She was born with a silver spoon in her mouth, and was a Heaven's prideling and the apple of everyone's eye. Everything had always went incredibly smooth for her and others did not even dare to scold her. How could she tolerate being schemed by the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the experts of the Black Demon Race sensed the Little Princess's killing intent and were startled, hurriedly rushing over to stop her.&nbsp;</span></p>

A wise man knows better than to fight when the odds are against him. The few people present were not of the Saint level, therefore it was best to avoid confrontation with the Saint expert of the Jade Pearl Sect. Their priority right now was the safety of the Little Princess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn it, is that him?” Bald fatty Sheng Yan had a change of expression when he saw the Saint expert in the sky. He suddenly recalled something and whispered to Ye Qingyu, “Brother, the situation is not very good, why would this guy be here... He is one of the most powerful figures of Jade Pearl Sect, called Yang Tianwu. He is known to be merciless, crazy, reckless, and disregards consequences. He is the eldest disciple of the present age Martial Emperor of the Jade Pearl Sect, but also the Saintess's eldest senior brother. One hundred year ago he had already reached the Saint boundary...”&nbsp;</span></p>

This time she even attempted to kill the Celestial Phoenix Maiden and the Little Princess of the Black Demon Race in the 18th district. From this it could be seen that she was merciless and cruel. The figure above was the Saintess’s senior brother, which meant that he was most likely more difficult to deal with than her. More importantly, a Saint expert with such a status had appeared here all of a sudden... Well, he most likely did not come here upon receiving the news but it was a deliberate arrangement laid out by the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover...&nbsp;</span></p>

The two beams of light from his eyes were like the sword light of judgment, fixed intently on Ye Qingyu. “Evil creature, surrender now, under the might of the sky you still want to resist?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Might of the sky? Hahaha the people of Jade Pearl Sect sure are all narcissistic.” Ye Qingyu had already calmed down by this time. He smiled, “The Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect is cruel, merciless and thought that she will certainly set foot on the Emperor's Road. Therefore she wanted to force other people to be her slave. She first killed the Leader of the Ancient Heavenly Dragon Sect, Yusheng Taoist and other powerful experts, and then she entrapped the Celestial Phoenix Maiden and the Little Princess of the Black Demon Race. She really had opened my eyes. And now an accomplished Saint level expert had come to deal with I, a nobody junior, isn't that really unnecessary, unless... your Jade Pearl Sect has something that cannot be known to others and you want to silence others....”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut up.”&nbsp;</span></p>

A frightening voice resounded across the Void like a roar of thunder. Countless people on Fierce Beast Peak had a change of expression, and felt that their ears were about to burst as everything in front darkened. Some of the weaker experts were even teetering. The qi within their body went disorderly, yuan qi was being drawn away and they could not withstand the power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The power of a Saint level expert was extremely terrifying.</span></p>

He was afraid that this level of pressure might injure his ancestor. After all, in the process of leaving the 18th district, his ancestor had already exhausted his strength.</span></p>

The people that were able to come here were all intelligent people. From the way that the Celestial Phoenix Maiden and the Little Princess of the Black Demon Race protected Ye Qingyu, they knew that it was very likely that what the youngster said was true and that the Saintess was lying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Void.</span></p>

Even if you escape here you will still be killed.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu still did not utter a word, but the Little Princess of the Black Demon Race coldly spoke again. “Hehe, when did the Jade Pearl Sect raise a dog that dares to bark in my Black Demon Abyss? Also, he dares to seal the Fierce Beast Peak in front of so many people. Haha, good, Yang Tianwu you really are bold. Does your Jade Pearl Sect think that your strength is already big enough to annex my Black Demon Abyss?”&nbsp;</span></p>

His first attack was to seal Fierce Beast Peak, which gave no face to the owners of Black Demon Abyss at all. Such behaviour was no doubt a provocation. As an expert of the older generation, such a move was indeed ill-conceived.&nbsp;</span></p>

They saw that the two super forces were neither budging an inch and if a real fight were to break out, they could be impacted and die here without knowing. &nbsp;</span></p>

Although they saw the formation being set up, they instinctively thought it was to prevent the criminal Ye Qingyu from escaping, but now they came to realiZe that it was not only Ye Qingyu, even they could not leave at all. &nbsp;</span></p>
