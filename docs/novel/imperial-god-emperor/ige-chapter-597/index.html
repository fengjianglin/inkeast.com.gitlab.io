A green jade hair pin tightly held the hair behind the back, jade circulating in her eyes like a spring. Her figure was slender, and her moon white dress had a yellow outer robe. There were several faintly pink silhouettes of peaches on her robe, her posture elegant. She was evidently not just some common owner of an inn.&nbsp;</span></p>

While speaking to the female owner, he had his head lowered, seriously writing something on the bamboo.&nbsp;</span></p>
