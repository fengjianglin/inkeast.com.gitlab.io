 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gate to the Demon Domain?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn't heard the million-year-old soul mention this before but it seemed like the most important place in the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu nodded but he didn't probe further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned and gestured to Hu Bugui, then they departed as a group. He continued to follow the guidance of the million-year-old soul to reach the end of the hall of [Tusita Palace]. There was a small transit space in the depths of [Tusita Palace] that resembled the one at the [Seven Elements Relief Palace]. However, it was darker compared to the one earlier and there were eight entrances within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These eight entrances were carved out of black rock and other than the fact that these entrances were headed in different directions, they looked exactly the same. The entrances were all extremely dark, just like the mouth of a giant beast and they looked as though they led to stranger and perilous unknown destinations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui looked at these entrances and didn't rush to charge into any of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that Ye Qingyu would make the correct decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He now had complete faith in little Ye Qingyu's decisions after he had brought them this far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's go," Ye Qingyu only paused a short second before he selected the third entrance on the right. He walked toward it without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui hurried to trail close behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a long corridor with seemingly no end in sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two men and a dog walked calmly along the corridor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A short while later, Ye Qingyu thought of something and asked telepathically, "Senior, those pills within the pill furnaces of [Tusita Palace] might just be able to help you reconstruct your body. Are you sure you don't want them?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had already asked the million-year-old soul this question earlier when he had been dividing the medicinal pills at [Tusita Palace].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the spirit had rejected him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why he suggested for those pills to be equally divided between Hu Bugui, Little Nine and Nan Tieyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he couldn't help but ask this question once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that they wouldn't have been able to seize this opportunity to arrive at the [Tusita Palace] before the rest without the guidance of the million-year-old soul. Otherwise, they would probably still be stuck roaming aimlessly around the maze and who knew what could have happened to them? If they were unlucky, they might have been sucked into various chaotic battles and be constantly on the run.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-year-old soul paused for a moment, then said telepathically, "Young man, you managed to remain honorable even in the face of precious treasures. It is rare indeed for someone to maintain a pure heart but I truly don't need those pills because they would be useless to me. The item I require to reconstruct my body is more precious than these divine pills. If I'm lucky, I might just be able to find it within this Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the million-year-old soul changed the topic and continued, "Instead, I'd like to give you some advice. If you have the time, you may open the 99th pill furnace on the west side of the Formation in advance. The content of this particular pill furnace is extremely powerful. Since I can tell that you are very knowledgeable in the study of alchemy and you have the ability to control pills, if you could refine this thing, it might help you if you encounter that Quasi-emperor who is hunting you down and it might… even be able to save your life."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu carefully recorded those words and replied thankfully, "Many thanks."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He committed these words to memory since he knew this million-year-old soul would never give pointless advice. The million-year-old soul must have calculated that there was something within that particular pill furnace before he said those words. Ye Qingyu was a little curious to know what exactly could that thing be for the million-year-old soul to say that it could help him against the Quasi-emperor?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this was clearly not the time to be opening that pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then another thought came to him and he asked, "Senior, you mentioned before that you were one final step away from constructing a brand new body and needed to obtain this item from the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor and you mentioned it again earlier. Could you share what is this thing that you are searching for?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they met at the mountain gate of the Greater One Sect, the million-year-old soul shared with him that other than the heart refined from the Storm Platform, he still needed to obtain a crucial item from the Reincarnation Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without the guidance of the million-year-old soul, Hu Bugui and himself would have never been able to come so far. He had already received a lot of favors from this million-year-old soul so he really wanted to do something for the million-year-old soul to repay his kindness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha ha, young man, I know what your intentions are. I'm looking for a legendary item that is known as the Immortal Body. However, I have yet to deduce the exact location of this item and currently have no way to find it. Thus, I didn't feel the need to mention it to you yet." The million-year-old soul replied with a smile. He was very comforted by how Ye Qingyu took the initiative to bring this matter up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was slightly surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immortal Body?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn't heard of this before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, from its name alone, he could tell that it was an extremely rare ultimate treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Any item that had the word 'Immortal' attached to it would be enough to drive everyone in the martial way crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Senior, could you let me know more about the Immortal Body?" Ye Qingyu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It is an ultimate treasure that existed in legends," the million-year-old soul answered truthfully. It paused for a while, then continued, "According to legend, hundreds of years ago, a piece of Immortal jade fell from the Immortal realm to the world when there was turbulence amongst the stars in the nine heavens. That piece of Immortal jade belonged to the Immortals and was extremely primordial. It was very pure, without impurities, dust or dirt and it felt as warm and as smooth to touch, just like skin. It was smooth, clear and absolutely perfect without any flaws. Its outer appearance resembled a human and it was so life-like that it looked no different from a human but it didn't have a soul. In the past, this piece of Immortal jade was recognized throughout the world as the perfect primordial Immortal form. Some even speculated that it could have been the corpse of a true Immortal but it was without consciousness. There was once even an Emperor of the martial way who declared that if one's soul entered the Immortal jade, one would be able to have the body of an Immortal. If one's soul seized this body and reincarnated, entering that body with a mysterious &nbsp;technique, one would be able to obtain a perfect body and obtain immortality, instantly attaining the Great Dao. During the Fiendgod Age, everyone in the world scrambled and fought manically for this Immortal body. This ignited a chaotic battle throughout the Vast Thousand Domains at one point in time. Later on, it was rumored that the Chaos Demon Emperor managed to obtain this Immortal body and according to legend, it was stored within this Reincarnation Hall. The Chaos Demon Emperor had been keeping it for his perfect hundredth reincarnation cycle and planned for its soul to enter this Immortal body after it had reincarnated. If he succeeded, he would have attained the highest form of the Dao. Unfortunately, he failed to complete this heaven-defying action and mysteriously disappeared during the hundredth reincarnation process. Therefore, I deduced that this Immortal body must just be found within this Reincarnation Hall. If I'm right and we manage to find the Immortal Body without any complications, I would be able to fully reincarnate."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was completely stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did the Immortal Body truly have such unbelievable origins?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immortal Body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did Immortals truly exist in this world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had read many records that mentioned the history of the Fiendgod Age but this was the first time he heard of the Immortal Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he already agreed to help the million-year-old soul, he would temporarily shelve his plans to find other opportunities for himself and the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t hesitate before saying solemnly, "If that is the case, once you have deduced an answer, we'll head straight for the Immortal Body. It would be good if you could possess an Immortal Body earlier too."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-year-old soul said telepathically, "Sure, but unfortunately, all I'm able to sense right now is a small trace of Immortal body qi. I can't be absolutely certain yet and would need more time to continue sensing."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu nodded and continued heading forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Approximately an hour later—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were almost at the end of the dark and dim corridor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui looked around expectantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silly dog on Ye Qingyu's shoulder was trying his best to wave his stiff limbs around in an attempt to regain control of his own body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was also curious to know where the million-year-old soul was leading them to next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, they could hear the sounds of fighting at the end of the corridor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huh?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was there a battle up ahead?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's face turned cold and after exchanging a glance with Hu Bugui, they silently exerted their yuan qi as they continued to cautiously make their way ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they arrived at the end of the corridor, they saw that they were in front of another main hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a plaque that was affixed to the top of the main hall and three words were splashed boldly across it in bold strokes ——</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Three Mountains Pavilion'.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This palace was similar to the other palace halls they passed by earlier. The Three Mountains Pavilion was a large palace and it was completely built from black rock in the shape of a precious tripod. It wasn't very big and was less than a hundred acres but its ceiling was extremely high and it was many times that of [Seven Elements Relief Palace]. When they looked up, they could only see a vast and boundless pitch-black darkness and it gave them the impression that they were standing in the middle of a hollowed out ancient divine mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sounds of fighting that they heard earlier came from the Three Mountains Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as they drew closer to the larger entrance, the clear and loud sounds of fighting earlier gradually became softer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sounds had completely disappeared in the ten breaths they took to arrive at the entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How odd. How could the sounds disappear so quickly?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu concentrated hard but he could no longer hear any sounds of fighting coming from the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn't just the sounds of fighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single sound from the Three Mountains Pavilion mysteriously disappeared as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Did the battle end that quickly?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui was also slightly astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the situation seemed out of sorts, this meant that there was definitely something wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui observed their surroundings as they slowly walked toward the hall, their expressions cautious and alert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They clearly sensed from the sounds of fighting earlier that there were large numbers of Great Saint realm experts battling chaotically. This was an extremely ferocious situation and this battle had the potential to crush the skies, so it couldn't have ended so quickly. Yet, the entire Three Mountains Pavilion quietened down all of a sudden, so they couldn't afford to let down their guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui exchanged a glance, then reached out to push the doors to the main hall open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The door creaked open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The incredibly powerful and rich residual Saint yuan qi energy and the strong pungent scent of blood came rushing toward them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui's yuan qi immediately surged to form a dazzling protective light shield over them.&nbsp;</span></p>
