 <p>Chapter 399 - The opportunity came too suddenly</p>
 <p>Both of Ye Qingyu’s hands transformed into dragon claws, holding the strange curved black blade.</p>
 <p>Xiao Lou’s entire body, as though it had stiffened abruptly, dared not to move an inch, afraid that his tiniest movement would trigger Ye Qingyu. It would cause him to really exert force and pull out the black blade.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere was a little weird.</p>
 <p>All gazes were focused on Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Everyone could see the fearful as well as angry expression on Xiao Lou’s face, and the silver scales and silver flames curling around Ye Qingyu’s hands, which stirred a strange feeling in everyone’s hearts.</p>
 <p>Including Yu Feiyan and Xing’er.</p>
 <p>It was evident, now that the battle had progressed to this degree, even an idiot could tell that, the youngster with the codename [War God] had won, won completely and won utterly.</p>
 <p>The last black ink-like palm image that Xiao Lou thrust out was the palm technique that had defeated countless Bitter Sea experts in the imperial capital before. It was the most powerful move of Xiao Lou, but also a move that countless famous top experts could not see through and dared not receive.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu received it head-on.</p>
 <p>Not only received it.</p>
 <p>But utterly destroyed this palm.</p>
 <p>Xiao Lou vomited blood and sustained serious injury.</p>
 <p>This palm and this mouthful of blood were tantamount to a little martial arts myth being shattered.</p>
 <p>While that claw and silver dragon scale paw were the beginning of another little martial arts myth.</p>
 <p>As for the black blade...</p>
 <p>Everyone could, from Xiao Lou’s unprecedented facial expression which could be called as an expression of panic, read a subtle message: this blade has a very special significance for Xiao Lou, not only because it was his defensive weapon or precious treasure, there were other reasons, other deeper significant meanings behind it.</p>
 <p>And Xiao Lou was evidently extremely worried that Ye Qingyu was really going to pull out the curved blade.</p>
 <p>What would happen when he pulled the blade out of its sheath?</p>
 <p>All eyes fell upon Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not speak.</p>
 <p>His gaze, calm with a trace of curiosity, was examining the dark as though ink-stained scabbard inch by inch, like he was caught up in deep thought, and seemed to be hesitant over something.</p>
 <p>This seemingly ordinary and mediocre curved black blade was evidently emitting a kind of majestic power. Even through the black scabbard Ye Qingyu could feel his heart thudding. But it was clear that because of the scabbard, the power inside was not able to be unleashed fully. Ye Qingyu suddenly had a theory: if he drew the sword out of the sheath at this moment, the power that was as terrifying as a monstrous flood may pour out instantly.</p>
 <p>He grasped the hilt with one hand and grabbed the scabbard with the other, exerting strength into his arms.</p>
 <p>“Stop it, hurry stop it, there will be a disaster, do not pull...” Xiao Lou cried out in panic, because at that moment, he clearly saw that there was suddenly a slight gap between the hilt and the scabbard.</p>
 <p>He really could pull out the blade.</p>
 <p>How was that possible?</p>
 <p>Xiao Lou’s mind went blank for a moment. He was unable to think of a reason why this person had the ability to pull out the blade. The huge shock caused him to scream out in panic.</p>
 <p>But the next moment, he stayed where he was dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>Because Ye Qingyu had not really pulled out the blade. Instead was quietly standing in the same place, letting go of the handle of the blade, and with a mischievous smile, casually swung his arm, throwing the curved black blade back over to him.</p>
 <p>Xiao Lou subconsciously caught the curved blade.</p>
 <p>“The [Listening to Spring Rain at Night], Xiao Lou... No matter what you come to the imperial capital for, the era of sects will never return... You are a person with a story, but I do not want your story, and my persistence to collide. I have returned your blade to you. We will fight again when you have the ability to unsheathe your blade.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu smiled and turned away from the martial arts battleground.</p>
 <p>After a careful examination and interaction with the power of the curved black blade, Ye Qingyu was absolutely certain that this Xiao Lou must be the descendant of a large influential ancient sect from the era of sects. A person like him, appearing around Yu Feiyan, just what did it signify?</p>
 <p>It seems that the imperial capital is deeper than he had imagined.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu came to Xing’er’s side, quietly standing behind her.</p>
 <p>And in the distance, Xiao Lou was trembling with an uncontainable fury, his hands were tightly clasped around the hilt of his blade, his knuckles were going pale and protruding out, as if his entire body would soon explode like an active volcano...</p>
 <p>But he didn’t in the end.</p>
 <p>He took a deep look at Ye Qingyu’s face, as if to engrave this face in the depths of his soul, and then slowly turned, the curved black blade in his arms. He stepped away from the martial arts battle ground, sinking into the distant ship’s cabin.</p>
 <p>The sharp piercing wind blew past the battle flag causing it to flutter loudly.</p>
 <p>The noise of the fluttering flag made the ship seemed quieter.</p>
 <p>When Ye Qingyu walked over to Xing’er’s side, a bright smile made its way across her delicate and beautiful face. She was sitting on the chair and did not speak, but her eyes and brows were exposing her mood.</p>
 <p>Yu Feiyan stood up smiling.</p>
 <p>His gaze swept back and forth between Ye Qingyu and Xing’er, like a father looking at his daughter and son-in-law, the more he looked the more satisfied he was, finally jokingly said, “Haha, little boyfriend defeated Xiao Lou, this girl is so happy that her mouth is almost going to split open... How about it, the gift that Uncle gave you is pretty good right? If your little boyfriend wants to soar in the imperial capital, then he must slowly become well-known. This battle, consider it as a small gift from Uncle.”</p>
 <p>There was suddenly a complex expression that flickered across her eyes and brows because of this sentence. It very soon disappeared and she resumed her previous complexion.</p>
 <p>She shook her head, then jumped to her feet, clapping her hands. “Uncle’s gif makes the receiver feel a bit apprehensive. If you continue to give such gifts, Xing’er would be afraid to accept it.”</p>
 <p>This was clearly a mockery more than a thank you.</p>
 <p>It was not even just mockery.</p>
 <p>There was a trace of hostility.</p>
 <p>There are many people living in the imperial capital, but those that dared to use this tone to talk to the Apex Prince can be counted with one’s ten fingers. If it was another person, she would have long been dead.</p>
 <p>But Yu Feiyan completely disregarded the mockery of Xing’er’s words, his face still kind and amiable. He helplessly shook his head, and then quietly looked at Xing’er, looking into the girl’s eyes. The prince’s face was still gentle and unprecedented calm. He gazed at her for a good while, then as though he thought of something, let out a long sigh.</p>
 <p>This long sigh, what meaning did it have?</p>
 <p>But everyone in the audience that heard this long sigh, their heart suddenly sank, and even the bright sky that was lit by the blazing sun seemed sad for a moment.</p>
 <p>Xing’er was taken aback.</p>
 <p>She lowered her head slightly, as though realizing something. She twirled strands of her long black hair around her finger, and then suddenly lost interest, bit her lip and said, “Uncle, since you have seen us now, I have something to do, I have to go...”</p>
 <p>Yu Feiyan nodded.</p>
 <p>“Girl, the children of the Yu clan, what can they not endure? You have left the imperial capital for too long, you don’t know what the imperial capital is like now. You heard some rumours when you came back, which caused some misunderstanding between us. This, I do not blame you, it takes a long road to know the strength of a horse. One day, you will know, who is really good to you,” he said with a tone of such deep meaning.</p>
 <p>Xing’er did not speak.</p>
 <p>Under Yu Feiyan’s gaze, she stretched out her slender hand and grasped Ye Qingyu’s huge hand, walked forward a few steps, when their figures flashed, and the two people turned to streams of light, disappearing from this place.</p>
 <p>Yu Feiyan silently watched this scene. His sword-like eyebrows were raised slightly, but he did not say anything.</p>
 <p>He stood quietly for a very long while.</p>
 <p>The guests were looking at the Apex Prince with very strange eyes.</p>
 <p>Comparing the Prince today and him at other times, the difference was very huge. This does not match up with the resolute, dignified and decisive image of the Apex Prince, but more like an inferior and lame elder.</p>
 <p>The Prince seemed to particularly favour the wilful and unruly Princess Xing’er and spoiled her. Even the little sovereign prince did not have such a treatment given to him.</p>
 <p>“Prince, Prince...” A slim, middle-aged adviser was slowly approaching and whispering.</p>
 <p>“Ah... Oh, what’s the matter?” Yu Feiyan was spaced out for a moment</p>
 <p>“The battle between that boy and Xiao Lou today, do we need to...” The adviser carefully worded his sentence.</p>
 <p>Yu Feiyan’s eyes were clear and calm.</p>
 <p>Almost at this moment, he had immediately restored the former glare that was like a tiger eyeing its prey, the manner and aura that made countless people fear had reappeared on this person.</p>
 <p>The corners of his mouth drew back in a smile as he replied, “I know what you mean, but do not hide it. Also spread the message out. I said that I will give Xing’er a gift, of course I have to send it. As for Xiao Lou... let him slowly think about it. There is no such thing as an undefeated person, if he figures this out, he can go find the boy to win back his loss.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The airship, travelling at the speed of flowing light, was fast as lightning in the sky.</p>
 <p>Xing’er had already released Ye Qingyu’s hand.</p>
 <p>The sky was very blue.</p>
 <p>The wind was very strong.</p>
 <p>Ever since returning onto the airship, she had remained silent.</p>
 <p>For the past ten minutes, she had been sitting at the front of the deck, legs stretched in the air, gently swaying side to side and humming a very nice tune...</p>
 <p>The strong winds lifted the young girl’s black hair, flickering like a black flame, radiating an indescribable beauty.</p>
 <p>“Where are we going?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu finally couldn’t resist asking.</p>
 <p>“Pfff” Xing’er burst out laughing, then turned around and cast a glance at Ye Qingyu. “I thought you would be immersed in the victory of winning against Xiao Lou and won’t bother to ask this.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s face darkened. “That’s nothing to be proud of...”</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, pretend to be a victim after gaining an advantage. If this spreads out, you would immediately become a famous person in the Jianghu of the imperial capital, you would be absolutely well known.”</p>
 <p>“Am I not famous enough now?”</p>
 <p>“Oh... you’re right.” Xing’er also had to admit that. Ye Qingyu had really caused a storm in the imperial capital these days. She smiled, “It seems you have awakened... The place that we’re going to next, you would never guess, it is the Imperial Ancestral Temple.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu gasped out without thinking, became speechless from astonishment, and then stuttered, “What what? What did you say? Imperial Ancestral Temple? The Offering Temple?”</p>
 <p>Xing’er stared wide-eyed at Ye Qingyu. “Yes, what? Can’t? Your incredibly astonished look seems a little strange...”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not speak.</p>
 <p>But he suppressed the excitement and quietly said to himself: the opportunity really came, but isn’t this a bit too sudden?</p>
