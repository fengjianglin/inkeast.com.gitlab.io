 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, he must kill Ye Qingyu today.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the only thought in the mind of the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's power and talent had completely shocked him. From Ye Qingyu, he vaguely saw an invincible demeanor. This was the demeanour of a Martial Arts Emperor. Therefore he had no doubt that, if he were to let Ye Qingyu continue to grow stronger, he would grow into an invincible existence. Since they had already angered Ye Qingyu today, then it would be best to directly eradicate the roots. In this regard, the hidden trouble would be destroyed while it is still in a sprouting state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom! Boom!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deafening roars and rumbles constantly broke out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three Great Saint experts had joined forces, but still failed to kill Ye Qingyu——Not to mention kill, they could not even suppress him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Lord, this boy is strange, and seemed to have adapted well to the power of the laws of the God and Demon Age,” another Great Saint expert reminded with a bewildered face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Young Lord of the Sinful Pit nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He also could tell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the news of the arrival of the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor had spread, everybody was shaken. First there were violent demonic aura circulating around the Wei River Mountain Range, then it was followed by changes in the laws of heaven and earth and the spirit qi tide changed. After the real Reincarnation Hall had descended, the law of heaven and earth was completely in an ancient state. For experts that had been used to the laws of heaven and earth of the present world, their strength was reduced by at least three or four times, including the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now it seemed that, Ye Qingyu was not in the slightest suppressed, and instead was like a fish in water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could it be that this person cultivates the martial arts of the God and Demon Age?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;A thought flashed in the mind of the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, this Ye Qingyu had risen so abruptly, and was without the slightest inheritance and background, yet he could soar to the sky. He must have received some ancient inheritance of the God and Demon Age, only that could make him become so strong in such a short period of time. There was not much of such God and Demon inheritance, could it be... the inheritance of an ancient emperor?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this thought, the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit drew a deep breath.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was absolutely certain that he had clearly seen through Ye Qingyu's hidden card.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just then, there was another sudden change in the battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A low grunt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A tragic scream.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both sounded at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had suffered a palm strike to his chest, flesh caved in at a depth of one finger. There was an incomparably clear palm print, and the sunken in flesh and blood was contaminated with thick ink-like black colour, like black flames were blazing, producing piercing sounds. At the same time a black sword had pierced his back, three inches into the body... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And one of the mysterious black figures was enveloped in crackling violet lightning, black smoke frantically being emitted from his body and vaguely there was a barbecued smell. His body collapsed like a broken kite, slamming into a mermaid-shaped crystal statue hundreds of meters away...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha, so he's the same as Feng Wuhen, had become a Great Saint through devouring power. His essence and yuan qi are not pure, how could he fight against me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu burst into loud laughter, sound waves surging, heroic spirit soaring to the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It turned out that he had directly exchanged injuries with injuries, forcibly received the two moves of the two Great Saint experts, and then with a full-strength attack, directly struck the third Great Saint expert. The lightning sword intent directly penetrated into the opponent's body, instantly twisted his meridians and dantian world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pfff...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the body slid down from the crystal mermaid statue, half the body was already destroyed. He struggled a few times, black blood flowed like a river, and wisps of black mist gushed out of his body like a leaking balloon. But he could not stand up and had lost the power to fight again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was evident that he was not going to survive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Young Lord of the Sinful Pit and the others drew a deep breath.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, as I predicted, the Sinful Pit had become the dogs of the Saintess of Jade Pearl?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's move had succeeded and seemed like he was unwounded. His body shook, and powerful aura burst out from his body. With a piercing sound, his white robe ripped apart, exposing his upper body, muscles were clearly defined like they were carved from a knife. Under the illumination of the extraordinary crystal brilliance of the [Dragon Palace], his body appeared to be as flawless as white jade crystals, glowing with a divine light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that the injuries on his chest and back was a terrifying sight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Especially the palm print on his chest, which the sinister black force had begun to spread. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Humph, nonsense, what does the matter of the Sinful Pit have to do with the Jade Pearl Sect?” The expression on the Young Lord’s face changed, eyes clouded, and then with a cold snort he immediately smiled a sinister smile. “Exchange injury with injury? This is the stupidest thing I’ve seen. We still have four people but you are seriously wounded, how can you fight against us? Today you will no doubt die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then let's see if you're capable of it.” The muscles on Ye Qingyu's back vibrated, sending the black sword inserted into his back flying out. The muscle instantly closed and not a drop of blood seeped out. However the wound was still cloaked by a faint black force, constantly corroding the surrounding flesh. As though he did not feel anything he grinned, “Are you not in a hurry? Why are you hesitating, attack together.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was going to battle against four. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Arrogant.” A Great Saint of the Sinful Pit raged violently, about to make a move.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Young Lord of the Sinful Pit waved his hand, motioning him not to be reckless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had seen Ye Qingyu's tricks many times before, including in Sunrise City and Chaos Storm where he had successively killed several experts. He could be described as cunning and unpredictable, and even the thought made one fearful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Young Lord of the Sinful Pit was not usually an overcautious person, but in the face of Ye Qingyu, he did not know when it started, but it was as though a seed of fear had been planted in him. Even if Ye Qingyu now looked miserable, severely wounded and unable to endure, he still felt that he was up to some sort of trick. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, in the Void, a cold and sinister laughter sounded, “Kekeke... you have been poisoned by the dark force, it is only a matter of time before you turn into a pool of blood, yet you still dare to boast shamelessly. The Third Deputy Envoy of the Human Race is finished.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the voices of the other two mysterious black figures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two had transformed into black glimmer of light, almost undetectable to the naked eye, rapidly shuttling in the Void, searching for Ye Qingyu's flaw. They were like tigers looking for their prey, constant pressuring Ye Qingyu, and forcing him to continue to activate qi to resist. That way it would accelerate the corrosive force of the poison. They were waiting for the moment the dark toxic force completely erupted in Ye Qingyu's body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And with the passage of time, Ye Qingyu was indeed affected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His sword intent and sword light were no longer as sharp and tyrannical as before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His imposing manner was quietly weakening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black palm print that was originally on the chest position had spread and expanded, and black flaming qi had already infected his entire upper body. The sword wound on his back, which he had sealed previously, overflowed with blood, and even his blood was dyed a dark colour... It was clear that he was almost unable to support any longer. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pff!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu staggered, spurting out a jet of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He began to feel like he was floating. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom! Boom! Boom!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several other dark palm markings were printed on Ye Qingyu's body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The domain of [Storm of Swords] had finally revealed a flaw, which was captured by the other side. Although it was only a tentative attack, but it had really wounded Ye Qingyu, making the two dark Great Saint experts more and more determined to continue and to pressure Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Streams of black and red blood trickled down Ye Qingyu's leg and flowed along the stone steps of the Immortal Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His imposing manner had declined significantly, and now was less than two-thirds of what it was before the battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the sword form and sword domain were intact, they were already unable to defend against the pressure and attack from the two dark Great Saint experts. His moves were no longer as perfect as before and there were increasingly more flaws appearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two dark Great Saint experts were perfectly poised, and after continuous verifications of the flaw, they cooperatively launched a killing move like they had read each other's mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black demonic formation sword had pierced through at an unbelievable angle, which was Ye Qingyu's biggest flaw, instantly crumbling his sword domain defense. Following a metallic clatter, sparks sputtering, and a moment of blur, all the confusion had faded away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The demonic formation swords were stabbed right into Ye Qingyu's body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One sword had pierced through from the left chest area and out from the back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another sword had stabbed into his waist and through the back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword body was flashing with demonic black flame, incinerating all objects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hilt of the sword was held in the hands of the two dark Great Saint experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their hands were also blazing with dark demonic flames, and demonic force was frantically being activated in their body, pouring into the formation sword and into Ye Qingyu's body as though it could completely kill Ye Qingyu in a split second.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything seemed to have come to an end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The legend of the Human Race was going to disappear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a look of joy on the face of the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was the man, who had created countless legends, finally going to die?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the split second that the demonic force penetrated into Ye Qingyu's body, unexpected changes happened once again. No one had noticed, and it was unknown when or what was the reason. In short, it was something that no warning sign could explain. Two dragon claws that were covered in silver crystals stretched out to crush the head of the two dark Great Saint experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like an iron claw squeezing a rotten peach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was effortless, quick, and without the slightest hesitation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demonic flame, unwillingly and in despair, began to disperse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also scattered along with it were the fierce and murderous glow in the eyes of the two dark Great Saint experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And the two hands that clung to the formation demonic swords had lost all their strength in a flash.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dragon claws, which had crushed the heads of the Great Saints, did not pause in the slightest, transformed into a fist at lightning speed, slamming a punch into the chests of the two dark Great Saints, and instantly destroyed all the life force in their bodies and killed their last hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom! Boom!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bodies of the two dark Great Saint experts flew out like rags, knocking into the crystal walls in the distance and turned into minced flesh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn, it hurts.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu grinned, instantly wrenched out the demonic formation swords that had stabbed into his body and tossed them aside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His complexion was pale, eyes were dark, and he spewed a mouthful of black blood as he staggered and almost fell to the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, his opponent was not one Great Saint expert, but three. Although, like the Greater One Spiritual Master, they had rapidly progressed to the Great Saint realm through some kind of dark demonic force devouring the essence of others, but they had obviously reached the Great Saint realm earlier than the Greater One Spiritual Master and were much stronger. It was almost impossible to take on all three of them at once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had done it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had exchanged the life of the three dark Great Saint experts with a body of wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such an achievement would definitely stir the world if it got out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the problem now was that, after killing the three dark Great Saints, Ye Qingyu was truly exhausted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was absolutely impossible for him to stand up to face the Young Lord as well as the Saint experts of the Sinful Pit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crouching down on the steps of the Immortal Palace, Ye Qingyu gasped for breath. His face was pale, and his body almost depleted of strength. Adding to this he could feel the dark poisonous force scurrying in his body and must immediately treat his injuries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, the [Cloud Top Cauldron] rotated out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Red flames sprayed out of the cauldron, surrounding the entire Immortal Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
