Once upon a time, it was also one of the most popular trading centers in Ancient Sky Dragon Domain. The chambers of commerce of major domains all had a station here, and the ores they exported were extremely pure. It was once a magnificent mining landscape... Unfortunately, thousands of years ago, because the environment and resources of Ancient Sky Dragon Sect were more and more depleted, not only were there no minerals in Golden Pond City, other natural resources also gradually declined. The chambers of commerce and forces of foreign domains also left one after another, and later, in order to survive, the slightly more capable residents of the city also moved away. The once prosperous Golden Pond City had become ruins buried under the yellow sandy soil more than three hundred years ago.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Unfortunately it had fallen to such a state. He couldn't help sighing with regret again. Since coming to Ancient Sky Dragon Domain, Ye Qingyu had never felt such a heavy heart before.&nbsp;</span></p>

And was there any way to reverse all this? &nbsp;</span></p>

There were relatively much less wind and sand, and around the village were bowl-sized roots of trees that looked already weathered, though several times smaller than those of the ancient Golden Pond City. However the remaining tree branches and trunks caught Ye Qingyu's attention, which he seemed to feel a wisp of life.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were only a dozen houses, which were all built from simple rocks. Though shabby and simple, and covered by sand and wind, the degree of damage was much less. Evidently in recent years, there were still people living here, but they did not see any figures along the way. The buildings were empty, the doors were missing, and the houses were half filled with yellow sand...&nbsp;</span></p>

But their faces were still faintly recognizable. Some had a fierce look, as though they were struggling with something before death, while others, though had dried and dark eyeballs, seemed to be displaying a strong thirst in the bottom of their eyes. There were also elderlies with endless despair and pain left on their faces.&nbsp;</span></p>

Everyone, whether men, women or children, in the last moment before death, seemed to be crawling in the same direction. It even could be said that they had exerted the last bit of strength to move their body one step closer to that direction.</span></p>

The silt at the bottom was slightly moist, but there appeared to be no water...</span></p>

The other wells had completely dried up, and it was only the bottom of this central well that was slightly moist. It could be imagined that the people inside the village all persevered to the end, to the last well. The men, women and children of the village had all gathered at the last thousand-year-old ancient well in the hope that the heavens would take pity on them, and bless the thousand-year-old ancient well of the village with water. However, fate was merciless, and they were eventually thirst and starved to death around the well... The whole village died as a result.&nbsp;</span></p>

In the face of death, they still maintained order. There were no signs of chaos, killing and fighting in front of the last water source. Upon a careful look, he noticed that near the well there were old and frail women and children, while the young people were at the very back. In the last moments of their life, they still held on to the virtues and limits of the Human Race, and gave the opportunity to live to the weak.&nbsp;</span></p>
