 <p>358 - Standing for ten days</p>
 <p>Time passed by second after second.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, another two hours had passed by.</p>
 <p>On the arena.</p>
 <p>The black-robed young man who had always remained silent, [Shadow], suddenly opened his eyes. HIs figure crumpled, bowing to the ground. Both his hands supported him on the ground, his mouth opened to let out a jet of black blood that was like a geyser. A stench of rotting flesh instantly began emantating in the air all around.</p>
 <p>The young experts all had shock in their faces.</p>
 <p>There were people that wanted to charge onto the arena to support [Shadow].</p>
 <p>"Don't move! don't touch him."</p>
 <p>The black-robed young man, [Shadow], was half kneeling on the ground. He kept vomiting blood on the floor, and more than half the arena was nearly submerged by his pitch black rotting blood. If this continued on, it was likely that all the blood in his body would be vomited out.</p>
 <p>If he was a normal person, losing so much blood would have long turned him into a corpse.</p>
 <p>But he was a martial existence who had already taken half a step into being a top level expert. There was much more blood in his body than a normal person.</p>
 <p>This was known as qi blood being like the ocean. For true top level experts, the blood contained within their body surged like a river. According to the rumours, those experts who had reached such heights that they could chase the wind and harvest the moon and had cultivated to its extreme, a droplet of blood could transform into an ocean. When they had entered the state of a Sage, an Emperor, this was furthermore something a normal person could not imagine.</p>
 <p>[Shadow] was someone whose strength was second only to Ye Qingyu amongst the eighteen experts. He had already taken half a step into being ranked as a top level expert. Therefore the blood in his body was like a stream. Such a loss of blood would naturally not pose any sort of fatal danger to him. It was only that it would weaken his body and cause him to lose his vigour. He needed to rest and recuperate for a few days before he could truly recover.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the black-coloured blood he spat out was in reality some unknown impurities caused by the injuries in his body when he fell into a state of demonic fire. Ye Qingyu had imitated that mysterious skinny old man in White Deer Academy. Using the power of the [Dragon Fist], he forcefully suppressed the evilness of the demonic fire in [Shadow's] body, forcing out the decaying blood in his body.</p>
 <p>However, Ye Qingyu's strength could not be truly referred to as top level. He had only forcefully shifted the black blood into Shadow's intestine. There was no way of ejecting it out of his body.</p>
 <p>Therefore, [Shadow] had needed to vomit like so.</p>
 <p>In the next fifteen minutes, [Shadow] vomited out nearly black decaying blood ten times the volume of his own body.</p>
 <p>On the arena, apart from where Ye Qingyu stood three meters away, the other places were all filled with decaying black blood.</p>
 <p>Then he slowly stood up.</p>
 <p>His figure shook, feeling lacking in strength. But the symptoms of falling in demonic fire had all disappeared. The yuan qi in his body flowed smoothly and calmly. Activating his qi, he felt indescribably comfortable. Such a supreme feeling was like his entire person was reborn. His spirit was flourishing and complete.</p>
 <p>His tribulation had passed.</p>
 <p>Not only had it passed away, his cultivation had became even more intricate. The bottleneck that he had encountered, he had broken through just like that.</p>
 <p>He wiped away the blood at the corner of his mouth. His expression was complicated as he stared at Ye Qingyu staring opposite him. Ultimately, he did not even say a single word as he turned and jumped off the arena. He paid his respects to the instructors that guarded them, then instantly returned to the dormitory.</p>
 <p>Bao Shinu and the battle technique instructor smiled.</p>
 <p>They could already see the change within [Shadow].</p>
 <p>Such a change was not only a change in his cultivation and strength. It was also a transformation in his heart and personality.</p>
 <p>"Order people to prepare the meal and add another two pounds of Origin crystal to be given to [Shadow]." The battle technique instructor gave his instructions. Very quickly, tens of soldiers, carrying large basket after large basket of food delivered it to the dormitory.</p>
 <p>But the large majority of gazes were still focused on Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Right now, Ye Qingyu was still silently standing with closed eyes on the arena.</p>
 <p>His breathing was neither fast nor slow, and there was not the slightest hint of yuan qi fluctuation in his body, as if he had fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>"Don't disturb him."</p>
 <p>Bao Shinu only again let out a shout.</p>
 <p>He was not clear on what state Ye Qingyu was in, but it should be something good. It was similar to enlightenment, and it must not be disturbed by them. For martial experts, such a state could only be encountered but not wished for. People gaining enlightenment into the Dao was like so. Right now, breaking Ye Qingyu's enlightenment was like killing his father or stealing his wife.</p>
 <p>Both instructors began guarding him.</p>
 <p>After observing for a while, the young experts dispersed with different expressions.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>"So the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] and the [Dragon Fist] I’m cultivating, would have so many harmonizing aspects."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's consciousness travelled around.</p>
 <p>Previously, when he had used the [Dragon Fist], he had aided [Shadow] in suppressing the abnormalities of falling into a state of demonic fire. In truth, at the beginning, Ye Qingyu had only wanted to use [Dragon Fist] like using a staff and use the [Supreme Ice Flame] in reality to suppress. The [Supreme Ice Flame] was said to be able to burn all materials, and it was also of the ice attribute. This was the most suppressive towards the abnormal power of demonic fire.</p>
 <p>But Ye had not imagined that when he fought with [Shadow], thanks to the incitement of his [Shadow Sword Mantra], Ye Qingyu suddenly comprehended something about the [Dragon Fist]. A vigourous power involuntary exploded. Faintly, he could sense a deeper layer of power within the [Dragon Fist] mantra. Such an understanding fiercely erupted within his mind. He suddenly realized that the [Dragon Fist] could suppress such a state of demonic fire.</p>
 <p>Such an enlightenment and comprehension towards the [Dragon Fist] exploded like a mountain landslide. It could not be stopped.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had a feeling that every fist he struck out increased his understanding towards the [Dragon Fist] marginally.</p>
 <p>Without sensing it, at the later stages, he had already fallen into a strange state. Within his eyes, he could only see where the abnormal power gathered within [Shadow's] body. His body was extremely optimal, it was as if the nine moves of the [Dragon Fist] had become his inherent ability. It would not harm [Shadow's] body in the slightest, and would also shake away the evil power that occurred after falling into a state of demonic fire.</p>
 <p>The nameless breathing technique, [Dragon Fist] mantra and added to that, the [True Will of the Sky Dragon].</p>
 <p>When these three great cultivation techniques combined, there was mysterious change that occurred. Even Ye Qingyu himself was immersed in such a minute feeling.</p>
 <p>He faintly felt, that the [Dragon Fist] mantra as well as the [True Will of the Sky Dragon], had a supplementary effect on each other.</p>
 <p>Faintly, Ye Qingyu felt that the urge to activate the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] fully and transform, soaring in the skies. But he still kept his wits and suppressed such a feeling.</p>
 <p>Dragonification.</p>
 <p>This was one of Ye Qingyu's greatest trump cards, he did not want it to be exposed like so.</p>
 <p>At this time, Ye Qingyu was already completely submerged into the essences of the [Dragon Fist] mantra as well as the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] colliding with each other. His entire person was like his soul had been ejected from his body. He could see this two groups of strange energy combining in front of his eyes. It was as if he could grab the divine light in front of him if he only extended his hands, but his hand could not be lifted, nor extended…</p>
 <p>Time passed by just like that.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu already did not know just how much time went by.</p>
 <p>When the two strange light energies finally mixed together, its colour mottled, it suddenly charged towards him and entered his consciousness.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was greatly shocked, then suddenly opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>"You little kid, just how long will you comprehend for?"</p>
 <p>Bao Shinu rubbed his own head.</p>
 <p>"He won't stay like that for his entire life will he?"</p>
 <p>The battle technique instructor also felt a headache.</p>
 <p>They had stood there for ten days and ten nights just like this, not moving in the slightest. If this continued on, they also did not know just how long they would stand for. It was rumoured that there were some divine people that, once they entered enlightenment, would not move for a hundred years. Their flesh would slowly wither, and their consciousness would also fade. Others would believe that they had already died, but after slumbering for a hundred years in their coffin, they would enter the Dao instantly and instantly become one of the Extreme level experts, recovering their vitality.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had already stood there and comprehended for ten days, without any signs of awakening. Twenty days had already passed of the one month training. If it was the end of one month and Ye Qingyu had not yet awakened, what should they do?</p>
 <p>The two instructors rubbed their head, feeling a headache coming on.</p>
 <p>They were still hesitant, whether they needed to report such a matter to the crown prince. Although the training camp was small, but this was something that the crown prince had personally made happen. If an accident happened...</p>
 <p>The other young experts had already gradually gotten used to such a scene.</p>
 <p>The two instructors were like mother hens looking after eggs, carefully guarding the [War God] on the arena. The young experts were looking on in amusement, and their gazes would occasionally turn to the [War God]. They would display expressions of envy. All martial artists would know just what the state the [War God] was in represented.</p>
 <p>The black-robed young man, [Shadow], had also come to the arena. After looking on for a while, he returned to train.</p>
 <p>After fighting the battle with the [War God], his strength had increased by leaps and bounds. The power of the [Shadow Sword Mantra] had already increased rapidly. After breaking past the bottleneck, his performance was terrifying. He sat stably on the number two position in the [Dragon Tiger List] without falling at all.</p>
 <p>It was that his performance had become much more silent than before.</p>
 <p>Previously, the person who would mock others and had a sharp tongue, who would fight with the other young experts over a small matter was not there anymore. The black-robed youth, [Shadow], had already not spoken for several days or fought with other people. If previously, [Shadow] was an unmatched sharp weapon that would glimmer even in darkness, right now he was an invisible blade that had hidden away all its light in darkness.</p>
 <p>One must know that the crown prince had already made arrangements for all these people. This was a gravely important matter. If after a month had entered, the most important [War God] was still in such a state, then the problem would be large.</p>
 <p>Many plans would have to be rearranged as a result of this.</p>
 <p>Who knew just how long the [War God] would comprehend for.</p>
 <p>If he was like the ancients that slumbered for a hundred years, even if when he awakened he would have incredible power, but at that time everything would be too late. Everything about the crown prince's plan would go to waste.</p>
 <p>"Such a matter cannot be delayed any longer. We must report to his highness." Bao Shinu said with a worried face---</p>
