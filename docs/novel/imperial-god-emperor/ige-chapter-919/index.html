 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 919, The bones are not very hard</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Li Wanhai had simply broken the pot this time. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that, no matter what the Deputy Envoy signified, regardless of what the identity of Ye Qingyu was, the problem now was that he had offended Ye Qingyu and that there was no way he could redeem himself. Even if he were to kneel down and begged for mercy, Ye Qingyu would not let him go so easily. Since this was the case, then there was no need to beg for mercy. He did not need to be afraid of anything since he had the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce behind him. The worst result would be the end of their cooperation. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Opposite.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Zheng smiled coldly upon hearing these words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of person was he? He was completely unscrupulous. Previously, perhaps he was hesitant to anger the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce, but now, Lin Zheng was now completely reassured, and directly refused, “Chief Li Wanhai, it's not beneficial to talk too much. Regarding this matter, it is your Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce that was in the wrong first. Chief Li Wanhai has no remorse, yet was aggressive and overbearing, and even insulted Palace Lord Ye Qingyu. If this can be tolerated, then what cannot? Even if your Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce admits the mistake, I will still settle the account.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You... good, that's good.” Li Wanhai did not expect to see Lin Zheng so determined. He knew that he would not be unable to find a way out of this embarrassing situation today. “One never sheds a tear until one sees the coffin, just you wait, this matter will not end so easily, wait till the fire of the Sky Suppressing military division falls on Snow capital, then you will know what is regret... Let's go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, Li Wanhai turned and walked away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He must get out of here first, then go back and figure out the truth of the matter, and slowly settle the account.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He already had a plan in mind. He had decided to personally go to the headquarters to report this matter to President Fu Tianao, and then he could put Ye Qingyu into a place of eternal doom.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had that confidence. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other people of the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce could only follow behind Li Wanhai upon seeing the scene. In truth, these people had thought that they occupied the absolute upper hand. Who would have known that, in the end, they had failed and would return in defeat. Each and every one of them felt as though their face had been slapped until swollen, especially a few of the powerful martial arts experts who hated the fact that they were unable to strike back and kill all the foolish officials of the Heaven Wasteland Empire. However, without the order from Chief Li Wanhai, they could only follow after him and leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment----</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Leaving?” Ye Qingyu's voice sounded. “Did I allow you to leave?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wanhai suddenly twisted around abruptly, eyes almost spraying out fire as he fixed a stare at Ye Qingyu who was sat on the main seat in the distance and fumed, “The one with the surname Ye, don't go too far. What? Are you going to stop us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu, sitting where he was, wore a look of mockery and pity on his face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had long planned to use the four major chambers of commerce to establish his power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Li Wanhai and the others were gone, then the banquet today would not even reach half of its purpose.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the white-haired old man, who had been standing behind Li Wanhai all this time, suddenly took a step forward, blazing light bursting out of his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next moment, his yuan qi and power instantly soared as he erupted out a Saint-level power. The old man was unexpectedly a Saint realm expert. Raging waves of yuan qi began to surge up violently with him as the center, and suddenly it looked as though a storm had been set off in the whole Fire Grove. The officials of the Heaven Wasteland Empire were swaying side to side like small saplings in the midst of a storm. Even the martial arts experts including the First Princess, the Golden Summit Prince, and Lin Zheng also felt as if an invisible hand had suddenly clutched their neck, unable to breath and their faces were twisted with shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless people turned to look at the white-haired old man. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;“As expected... too strong.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“An absolutely strong expert... It's not good, could it be... the power of the legendary Saint realm?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The First Princess and Hu Yu had a sudden change of expression, and hurriedly released their strength to block the power, so as not to injure the other courtiers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Saint power emanated through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white-haired old man was like a god. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lowly ants, do not try to provoke the majesty of the heavenly divine dragon.” The white-haired old man had suppressed everyone present with his imposing manner. With a calm and indifference face, his eyes fell on Ye Qingyu, icily arrogant, as if he was looking at a dead man. “The Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce cannot be humiliated. Little fellow, you have passed, perhaps you can be counted as an important figure in Heaven Wasteland Empire, and perhaps had some ways to make Xie Yuyun and the others kowtow to you, but the bones of my Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce are much harder than theirs. Be prepared to bear the Sky suppressing wrath...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before his voice faded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without saying a word, Ye Qingyu very impatiently thrust out his palm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the old man had the time to react, an explosion struck where he was due to the blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under this punch, a majestic Saint expert was like smashed watermelon, instantly turned into a puddle of bright red blood and not the slightest fragment of bone was in sight. He did not even have the chance to strike back at all. The Saint realm power that was everywhere, following Ye Qingyu's punch, was suddenly dispersed like the thin layer of snow on an autumn field in the sun, and seemed to have not existed at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was utter silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fire trees were whispering.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone seemed to be frozen where they were.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Except for Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He gently drank the wine in the cup, then smiled, looked at where the white-haired old man was standing before, shook his head, and quipped, “It seems that the bones of the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce are not that hard. They have shattered in one punch.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hissing!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a sound of cold air blowing around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The courtiers felt light headed, also their teeth aching with cold air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Saint realm expert was destroyed in one punch!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The First Princess and Hu Yu were already speechless with shock. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had known for a long time that Ye Qingyu’s strength had long reached a very frightening level, but it had never crossed their mind that he would be this powerful. He was able to single-handedly destroy a Saint expert, like he was crushing a mosquito. To be able to do this, he most likely had already reached the pinnacle of the Saint realm or... a Great Saint, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But how could this be, how could Ye Qingyu become so strong?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them couldn't understand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A person who equally could not understand was Li Wanhai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before that punch, the experts of the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce behind Li Wanhai were all eager to wipe out the Heaven Wasteland Empire, which they saw to be as weak as chickens, but now they were shivering like chickens before the coming storm, terrified and helpless, and wishing to bury their head at once.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wanhai had already lost the courage to move his foot anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Any arrogance and superiority he had, in that seemingly half-hearted but powerful punch, which could destroy a Saint realm expert, had dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strong!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Too strong!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could the mad dog from a lower domain be so strong?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Wanhai was very clear about the strength of the white-haired old man, who was a well-respected person in the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce, and a Saint expert of hundreds of years with many fighting experience. He looked as though he had an elegant demeanour, like that of an Immortal, but in fact, was a murderous and cruel person. However, a Saint expert like him was destroyed in an instant, without the slightest fragment of bone remaining and the spirit extinguished...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wanhai's mind went blank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And at this moment, there were sounds of footsteps coming. Another Light soldier trotted in to report, “Lord, President Fu Tianao of the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce has suddenly arrived, and is now outside of Light City, requesting to see Palace Lord.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everybody looked shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The president of the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce had come in person? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh? Fu Tianao?” Ye Qingyu was a bit of a surprise, but then laughed, “This is really coincidental, invite him in.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arrival of Fu Tianao made Ye Qingyu feel a little surprised, but it was only surprise and nothing more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given the status that Ye Qingyu had today, even the president of a top chamber of commerce still had to bow and pay respect to him, let alone the fact that the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce was a chamber of commerce of the Human Race. Fu Tianao was still lower than Ye Qingyu in status. Although the third deputy envoy was only a deputy envoy position, it was still a position, and could at least suppress Fu Tianao on the surface. Ye Qingyu was not in the slightest worried about what waves Fu Tianao could cause.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It would be best if the president of the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce knew what to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he, like Li Wanhai, was a ruthless character, then Ye Qingyu wouldn't mind getting rid of him as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason that Ye Qingyu held this banquet today was to demonstrate and show his strength and energy, to deter people, whether external or internal, and to choke to death some of the possible hidden dangers while they were still in the sprouting stages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wanhai, who did not know what to do, upon hearing that the President had arrived, his eyes flashed an inexplicable glimmer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, two figures, led by a group of armoured Light soldiers, came to the banquet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person in front was a burly and tall square-faced man. His face was very imposing looking but he was not in the slightest bit furious. With one glance and it was obvious that he was someone who had held an important position for a long time. He was the President of the Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce, Fu Tianao, and following behind him was an old man in a plain robe. He did not emit the slightest aura and looked like an ordinary old man, with his grizzled brows covering his eyes. He was Fu Tianao's trusted aide Ke Juxian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Wanhai's eyes lit up when he saw that the President had really arrived. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before anyone spoke, he rushed over all of a sudden, fell to his knees with a thud, and cried loudly, “President, you have come, I feel ashamed that I have let you down. Young master Fu Yan has been killed by the [Ice Sword Killing God] Ye Qingyu. Young master Fu Yan is dead... he's dead... He died miserably... Although this subordinate of yours is aware of this cooperation, but I am really furious, and came to find this madman to understand the situation. As a result... as a result, even Elder Bai was killed... that madman is so arrogant, even if you had come in person, he does not care. In his eyes, our Sky Suppressing Chamber of Commerce is nothing but trash...”</span></p>
