 <p>Chapter 303 - Ximen Yeshui</p>
 <p>“Resurrected?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stood there in shock.</p>
 <p>When the red tasselled spear left his body, the tall and burly man was resurrected?</p>
 <p>“Ah ah ah, I can’t die, I am Nangong Liang... I can’t die...” The burly man threw away the shield in his hand, staggering out of the pool of blood and covered the wound on his chest.</p>
 <p>But before he had walked a few steps, his body suddenly swelled up. A dark energy burst out from inside the body, and with a loud bang, his whole body exploded.</p>
 <p>Flesh and bones splattered in all directions.</p>
 <p>In the end, it was hard to escape death.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stood speechless for a long while.</p>
 <p>Looking at the red shield shattered to pieces and the swamp of blood on the ground, Ye Qingyu’s chest thudded with apprehension and he could not help but feel a tinge of sadness for the burly man. Perhaps he indeed had no reason to die and there were too many things he could not give up on, but he ultimately had died in the ancient city ruins. There was nothing left of his corpse.</p>
 <p>“We have to hurry up. Someone was already here before us.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu no longer wasted any time, increased his speed and darted with the quickness like lightning, chasing after the red tasselled spear.</p>
 <p>“Woof, woof. This place is strange, seems familiar... strange, why would I feel this way? I seemed to have been here before.” Silly dog Little Nine jumped onto Ye Qingyu’s shoulder with a puzzled look, constantly glancing around, as he said in a suspicious tone of voice.</p>
 <p>“You’ve been here?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu asked in surprise.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know, this place feels seemingly familiar, but you also know that I can’t remember anything before meeting you. It’s strange...” Little Nine looked deep in thought.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was even more surprised.</p>
 <p>He had unintentionally found Little Nine from the mysterious Dragon Cave of the [Boundary Canyon Battlefield]. Little Nine himself had already exceeded all his expectations. Even until now there were many unsolved mysteries, yet another mystery was added to this growing list.</p>
 <p>Maybe this little glutton really had been here before, but he doesn’t remember.</p>
 <p>What kind of place was this?</p>
 <p>Why did it make Little Nine feel this way?</p>
 <p>This and the fact that those demonic beasts all fled in panic at the sight of Little Nine a while ago, what sort of connection was there?</p>
 <p>Demonic Beasts?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu suddenly realized something.</p>
 <p>That’s right, why did the unending stream of demonic beasts suddenly disappear?</p>
 <p>Ever since the grey mist had dispersed and they entered into the dark space of the mysterious ancient city ruins, the endless horde of demonic beasts seemed to have disappeared all of a sudden, and without the slightest trace?</p>
 <p>What was going on?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s heart was beating fast.</p>
 <p>So far, the degree of strangeness of the whole matter far exceeded his assumption.</p>
 <p>Could it be that within the grey fog, there was some sort space-distorting obstacle that caused them to be unwittingly separated from the demonic beast horde and sent to another place?</p>
 <p>Or could it be, the ruins itself was a micro domain hidden in the depths of Deer Mountain, but because of some unknown reason underwent a number of changes, released grey fog and also an endless number of demonic beasts?</p>
 <p>The last time the demonic beast horde appeared was five years ago.</p>
 <p>Is five years the cycle of rebirth?</p>
 <p>This five-year interval, just what does it mean?</p>
 <p>There were countless questions coming out of Ye Qingyu’s mind.</p>
 <p>Like a bolt of lightning, at a height of more than 10 meters above the ground, he flashed ahead.</p>
 <p>Along the way, he passed many collapsed temples and walls, countless ancient stone palace halls and buildings that have become heaps of rubble, dried up rivers, collapse fountain sculptures, broken barracks and a public square full of potholes...</p>
 <p>This was evidently an ancient city devastated by war.</p>
 <p>With Ye Qingyu’s speed, in a short period of time, he could fly hundreds of miles, but at this old cemetery-like ancient city, it seemed he would never reach the end.</p>
 <p>Along the way, there weren’t any other strangeness.</p>
 <p>After approximately five minutes.</p>
 <p>In front, all of a sudden, came the yelling of demonic beasts like the roar of tsunami and the howling of a mountain, and he could vaguely hear the sounds of millions of demonic beasts surging forth.</p>
 <p>“What? The grey mist is appearing again?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s face revealed a glimmer of shock.</p>
 <p>Because at the end of his line of sight, the faint grey fog appeared once again, shrouding the collapsed buildings of the ancient city for thousands of meters. The shadows of the deity statues were once again enveloped by that terrifying and murderous grey haze.</p>
 <p>The roar of the demonic beasts that they had heard before, echoed out from the grey fog.</p>
 <p>“I smell a familiar taste...” Little Nine said sulkily, his nose twitching. “It’s those running pieces of meat, but this kind of thing really cannot fill my belly. No matter how much I eat, I’m still not full...”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not speak.</p>
 <p>At a few hundred meters away from the edge of the grey fog, he came to a stop.</p>
 <p>He was a little puzzled.</p>
 <p>The scene in front looked so familiar.</p>
 <p>After flying for some time, it seemed like he had returned to the entrance of the ancient city of broken ruins, everything looked familiar, but he was certain that he had been flying ahead in a straight line and not made any turns whatsoever.</p>
 <p>Were they back at their original starting point?</p>
 <p>Or have they arrived in the center of a different fog?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was unable to make up his mind</p>
 <p>The heart-palpitation-inducing howling of the demonic beasts echoed from within the distant fog, as if the next moment there would be an endless number of demonic beasts breaking through the fog.</p>
 <p>Suddenly——</p>
 <p>“Hey, little brother, you also arrived early. It seems you’ve also received news and came to explore the [Base of the Formation Sovereign]”?</p>
 <p>A voice suddenly sounded without any warning behind him.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was startled. He flashed out of sight to a place of more than 50 meters away before he looked behind him, only to see a yellow-robed scholarly young man at more than 10 meters away from him, grinning at him.</p>
 <p>The yellow-robed scholar looked around 20 years old. He had a slim body, an elegant scholar hat with jade beads hanging down his forehead, a scholarly sword hanging at his waist and on his back was a bamboo box of small books. He looked like a scholar who was touring around the world. His skin was dark and when he smiled, his pearly white teeth gave off a feeling of intimacy.</p>
 <p>Just when did he show up?</p>
 <p>I didn’t sense him at all?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not relax his vigilance completely, asking in response, “[[Base of the Formation Sovereign]? Just what is that?”</p>
 <p>“You don’t know? Then why did you come here? It’s dangerous here.” The yellow-robed scholar looked up and down at Ye Qingyu, carefully answering, “The appearance of the [Fog of Annihilation] at Deer Mountain had alarmed the entire Jianghu because any place that the [Fog of Annihilation] appears, must have something to do with the [Base of the Formation Sovereign]. Heh, the [Base of the Formation Sovereign] is somewhere that may contain the space-time imperial residence of the [Formation Sovereign] Luosu, one of the Sovereigns of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors... Don’t tell me you don’t even know about stuff like this?”</p>
 <p>The [Fog of Annihilation]?</p>
 <p>The imperial residence of the [Formation Sovereign]?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was trying to quickly understand these words, while looking at him and asking, “I did not know... and you are?”</p>
 <p>“Oh, I am Ximen Yeshui, what about you, little brother?” The yellow-robed scholar bowed, his action extremely gentle and modest, and introduced himself with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Ximen Yeshui?” Ye Qingyu carefully thought about this name. He had not heard of this name before, but anyone that could come here and also knew about the secret of this place, was definitely not an ordinary person. It could be assumed that this person should be very famous among the Jianghu of the empire, but Ye Qingyu was not born in Jianghu so he obviously had limited understanding. He cupped one fist in the other hand and said, “It’s an honour to meet you at last.”</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui has a strong ability of discerning what someone thinks from his body language, after observing Ye Qingyu’s facial expression he laughed, “It’s normal that little brother has not heard of my name before, because I’ve just completed my training and have not made a name for myself in Jianghu yet.”</p>
 <p>So it was like so.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu suddenly flushed in embarrassment.</p>
 <p>He did not think that his words ‘it’s an honor to meet you at last’ would become such a joke.</p>
 <p>“Little brother, you also came for the [Base of the Formation Sovereign]? Ximen Yeshui once again brought up the previous topic.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu shook his head. “I came here to investigate something else. I did not know about the news of the [Fog of Annihilation] and news of the [Base of the Formation Sovereign]. But since I happen to be present just at the right time, I should also go take a look. The legacy of the [Formation Sovereign] Luoso is something that no one is willing to let pass by.”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, good, well said. Little brother you are so frank,” Ximen Yeshui said with a bright and warm smile. “It seemed little brother you do not understand the things here. Since I feel like old friends with little brother at our first meeting, why don’t we travel together.That way, we can look after each other.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu hesitated for a moment then nodded. “Then, I will trouble brother Ximen.”</p>
 <p>Although Ye Qingyu could not determine the strength of Ximen Yeshui, but his intuition told him that this person did not have any evil intentions. From his style of speech, he seemed like a straightforward and frank person, easy to get along with and not treacherous, so it would be safe to travel together with him. After all, Ye Qingyu was running around like a chicken and most likely wouldn’t gain much by himself.</p>
 <p>“Haha, sons and daughters of Jianghu should help each other, and to tell you the truth, I also have to find little brother because I have no sense of direction. I often get lost and cannot distinguish between North, East, South, and West. Especially in this environment, which is like a labyrinth. Before running into little brother, I’ve been going around in circles in the ancient city ruins for half a day...” Ximen Yeshui said with an embarrassed look, scratching his head. “So even if I have a map, I’m still stuck here.”</p>
 <p>“Woof, map, what map?” Little Nine’s eyes lit up, excitedly jumping up and down.</p>
