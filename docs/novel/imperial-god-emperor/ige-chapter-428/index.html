There were faint patterns that seemed to glimmer slightly. There were sounds of screaming and killing from the pictures of the battlegrounds, and others were of hunting, of farming, of sacrificing, of celebrating. There was light that occasionally &nbsp;flickered, and sometimes illusions that appeared...</span></p>

As the [Cloud Top Cauldron] swirled, the mist was all absorbed within the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. The gigantic bronze cauldron seemed to be enwrapped in steam.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu was shocked, then discovered that the disappearance of such mist and vapour had not weakened his own strength. Only then could he rest assured.</span></p>

They became the two sources of light, one gold and one silver, letting out strange light. Faintly, such splendour intersected. It was unknown just what sort of influence this would have on the desert world as well as Ye Qingyu's cultivation.</span></p>

He came to the floating stone steps and attempted to see if he was able to depart from the stone palace. But the result still made him disappointed. The mysterious and gentle power was still there, trapping him within the stone palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He had already entered into the River level of the Bitter Sea stage, could he still not protect himself?</span></p>

The gentle power was still there, which represented that the Spirit monkey did not believe that with Ye Qingyu's current strength, he would be able to resist against the assassination attempts hidden in the dark.</span></p>

But it was a pity he could not depart from the stone palace. At this time, he could only be patient. Above the stone foundations of the stone palace, he surveyed from high above as he gave pointers to the cultivation of Bai Yuanxing, Jin Ling'er and the others. Before he had finished, there was someone that came to report from the outside, saying there was a guest.</span></p>

Bao Shinu paid his respects.</span></p>

But right now, Ye Qingyu was in name one of the powerful ministers of the Empire, and he was the Lord of an organization like the [Light Palace] which possessed special authority. Naturally, his identity right now was completely different. Bao Shinu naturally needed to pay his respects when seeing Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu laughed greatly, and quickly assisted him through the air, "There is no need, instructor. Long time no see, I have missed you."</span></p>

Therefore, Ye Qingyu's impression of the two instructors was extremely good, and he was utterly grateful. Naturally, he would not be ostentatious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After conversing, Ye Qingyu said seriously, "I wonder for what matter have you come here for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As one of the people within the faction commanded by the Crown Prince, Ye Qingyu believed that Bao Shinu definitely had motives in coming here to the [Light Palace] at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Bao Shinu nodded his head. "I have something that I need the Lord to confirm."</span></p>

We have not seen you make any movements whatsoever, I wonder... just what plans do you have?" Bao Shinu was somewhat hesitant, but he still straightforwardly threw this question out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu heard this, then instantly realized, this was not Bao Shinu's question .This was most like what the Crown Prince behind him wanted to know.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Without hesitation, Ye Qingyu roughly recounted his current situation.</span></p>

It's just that I've been imprisoned, I can't help myself," Ye Qingyu said, somewhat helpesless." Right now, even I don't know, when I will be able to leave."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After Bao Shinu heard this, he fell silent for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; All the guesses he had before were overthrown.</span></p>

If Ye Qingyu was not able to leave within the next three or five years from the [Light Palace], then even if he left after that, he would not be of much use to the Crown Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "In these months, the situation within Heaven Wasteland Domain has vastly changed.” After some thought, Bao Shinu spoke again, "Right now, the situation of the Empire is not great, and is in danger. These are not just false warnings. Are you aware of this?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; “What’s the matter?” Ye Qingyu was taken aback.&nbsp;</span></p>
