 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Light Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A white-clothed Ye Qingyu was sat opposite the empress, who had changed into ordinary clothes, talking and laughing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The empress was personally making tea. Her movements were elegant, her smile was like the flowers in spring, and she did not have the slightest of her usual noble and majestic air. She looked more like a loving wife. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After several years of cultivation, Yu Xiaoxing's spirit, energy and qi had improved massively. The imperial qi that was exhausted in the Battle of the Chaos Storm had been completely restored, and her cultivation base had grown to the Saint realm. This was related to the cultivation resources that she had received, but also to the tides of spiritual qi in Heaven Wasteland Domain——The domain gate opened, and the spiritual aura of Heaven Wasteland Domain had increased dramatically, and thus the power of all living beings was growing rapidly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now besides the northeast White Mountain Black Water territory, the other territories are still firmly under the control of the Empire. The Dragon Tooth Army of the Dragon Human Race’s God of War, Xu Wuya, broke into the domain and first entered into the Northeast territory, and now had completely wiped out the rebellious Brute Race of the northeast. Those forces that support the Brute Races have also surrendered to the Dragon Human Race. However, what was strange was that, after the Dragon Human Race army occupied the northeast Territory, they did not advance any further.” The empress smiled. “Cousin, when you were in Heaven Connect City you stopped me from personally leading the soldiers in this military operation and told me to avoid fighting with the Dragon Human army. Could it be you already predicted the situation today?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu gave a smile, “I did not predict this, it’s just that Xu Wuya wanted to express gratitude for getting back the [Dragonblood Halberd] from me, so they sent me a big gift.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What gift?” The Empress's eyes were curved like crescent moons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Dragon Human Race had long sensed the infiltration of some foreign forces into Heaven Wasteland Domain. At that time we were in a hostile position with the Dragon Human Race, so those forces contacted the Dragon Human Race in the hope of joining forces with the Dragon Human Race,” Ye Qingyu explained the deal that he made with Xu Wuya on Capital Sky Peak that day. “It was just that Xu Wuya did not want to be against us. I had gone to Dragon Human Domain to help him with a big favor. Therefore he broke into Heaven Wasteland Domain under the pretense of declaration of war on Heaven Wasteland Empire, but was in fact... Xing'er do you see it now?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;“So it was like this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Xiaoxing's face lit up with understanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It turned out that the situation today had been decided long ago. Otherwise, she really would have thought that her remarkable older cousin really had the ability to predict the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This plan was to confuse the enemy, and using each other to catch the enemies off guard. Following this, the situation will gradually become clearer.” Ye Qingyu received the cup of tea from Yu Xiaoxing and gently took a sip. “Xu Wuya will soon withdraw the army from Heaven Wasteland Domain. Xing'er only needs to send an army to the northeast territory to take over the arrangements. It will not be long before Xu Wuya comes to Snow capital to pay you a visit. He will represent the will of the Emperor of the Dragon Human Race to form an alliance with Heaven Wasteland Empire. This is a great opportunity for our Heaven Wasteland Domain.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really?” Yu Xiaoing joyfully exclaimed. “This is really great news, although we had formed an alliance with the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain, but the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect has already deteriorated and does not have much of a voice in the Vast Thousand Domains. The Dragon Human Race is different. As long as it is a fair contract of alliance, that means our Heaven Wasteland Empire is really taking the first step to face the Vast Thousand Domains.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu nodded with a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right, what is the current situation in the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain?” He thought of mother Qin Hui and her son, especially Tian Ning, who was now the young master of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect. Although he had pretty good aptitude, he was after all still too young. However he was considered as one of his disciples, yet as his master he has not had the time to teach Tian Ning anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Xiaoxing told Ye Qingyu the current situation of the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The deterioration of the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain was already inevitable. After Ye Qingyu subdued the Little Puppet Bloodworm, the life force of the domain was no longer declining but it still could only be barely maintained, with a lifespan of no more than three hundred years. The environment was worsening as before. After the help of Heaven Wasteland Domain, the majority of the Human Race had relocated to Heaven Wasteland Domain and some bandits had also been mercilessly wiped out by the army of the Heaven Wasteland Empire. The present Ancient Sky Dragon Domain had become a training ground for the troops of the Heaven Wasteland Empire. In such a harsh environment, one can really train up a true elite.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tian Ning was now in Heaven Wasteland Domain, and with the assistance of some loyal elders of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, had also established himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Use the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain to train the army?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled. This was not a bad idea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ask the Great Dragon Turtle Demon to send Mister Ren Puyang's adopted son Ren Xingyan to Heaven Wasteland Domain. It is more peaceful and calmer here. Heaven Connect City was too chaotic, and would most likely become more and more chaotic.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Xiaoxing nodded and ordered someone to pass on the message.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had already successively accepted several disciples, who all had good aptitude. Unfortunately Jin Ling'er had fallen into the enemy’s hands in the Immortal God Emperor Sect, along with Bai Yuanxing and other people. Their whereabouts were still unknown, so he couldn’t help but worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wen Wan and Ximen Yeshui and the others, where are they now?” Ye Qingyu then asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those two, after the matters of the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain ended, they came back half a year ago, and stayed in Snow capital for a very short time before they left again. It is said that they went to settle some matters in Brother Ximen Yeshui's sect together. I haven’t received any news after that. I have sent a lot of people to inquire, unfortunately no information had come back.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Returned to his sect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was a little surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his impression, Ximen Yeshui had always kept secret about the matters of his sect and had rarely mentioned it before. Moreover the reason he was wandering in the outside world was because he did not want to return to his sect, and seemed to be deliberately hiding something. Why would he suddenly want to go back to the sect, but Wen Wan also accompanied him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been half a year since the two were gone. It was most likely that things did not go smoothly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, Ye Qingyu then asked about Old Fish.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yu Xiaoxing took out a letter that Old Fish left for Ye Qingyu. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have found clues about the Thunder and Lightning Emperor and had gone to find him, don't miss me too much.” There was only this short sentence written in the letter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Fish did not want Ye Qingyu to go find him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu understood that the place that Old Fish was going to might be very dangerous, so he deliberately gave little details to prevent Ye Qingyu from searching for him. But he was also very shocked. Could it be that one of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors of the Human Race, the Thunder and Lightning Emperor was still alive on this world? What sort of clue had Old Fish found? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let's not talk about these things. Cousin, we haven't practiced the sword together in a long time.” The empress's cheeks reddened, light flickering in her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled, “Right. I have tidied up the [Young Xiaoxing of the Fast-Aging Heaven Wasteland] sword technique several times. Let’s practice this together, I will teach you this new sword technique.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really? That's great.” Yu Xiaoxing jumped up. This was the empress feared by the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain, but she looked more like a shy and excited little girl in front of the person she loved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew in her heart that, even though Ye Qingyu was incredibly busy these days, he still tidied up the [Young Xiaoxing of the Fast-Aging Heaven Wasteland] sword technique, which meant that he also have thought about her. This to Yu Xiaoxing, was the best news.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the fire grove of the Light Palace there were fluttering sword lights.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clad in white, Ye Qingyu and Yu Xiaoxing, who were practicing sword together, were as beautiful as a celestial scenery. The two people resembled an Immortal couple, and a soft and gentle affection was flowing around the fire grove.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was undoubtedly the happiest moment for Yu Xiaoxing in the last few years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She really hoped that she was not the high and mighty empress, and her older cousin was not the deputy envoy of the Human Race who supported the entire empire. The two people were carrying too much on their shoulders. Behind the endless beautiful scenery was incredibly heavy pressure. If possible, Yu Xiaoxing only wanted to forever be with the one who she loved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately happy times always flew by like arrows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At sunset, Lou Yi came to report that Lin Zheng and other core figures of the empire had finally come upon receiving the news, and were now waiting outside the Light City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the next three days, Ye Qingyu stayed in the Snow capital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That day when he saw Lin Zheng and the others, they simply exchanged greetings, and did not mention or ask about the affairs of the empire. Even if Lin Zheng, Li Guangbi and others brought it up, Ye Qingyu would only dismiss it with a laugh, and not say anything else. At the end, Lin Zheng and others did not mention it again. Since, Ye Qingyu had appeared in the Snow capital, it was already the best cardiac stimulant for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Zheng had also brought up the marriage of the empress several times, to which Ye Qingyu only smiled in response and did not make a clear statement. Everything had to be pushed back until he came back from the dark domain. If he were to marry Yu Xiaoxing and was gone forever, then that really would hurt her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides this, Ye Qingyu spent the majority of the time practicing swords with Yu Xiaxoing or looking up some ancient imperial books.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few days later, Ye Qingyu went to see some old friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Including the Empire’s Pill God and Doctor Ouyang Buping. Ye Qingyu wrote down all his new knowledge, insights and new works in medicine into a jade scroll and unreservedly passed them on to these two people. There was no need to attach so much value to it because it is his own, it was fine to pass on to the people who were qualified and suited. This could be considered as handing down such remarkable skills and establishing a sect through these two people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then he went to see Song Qingluo again. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Qingluo was now the head of the Qingluo Merchant Company. Let alone the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain, even in the Vast Thousand Domains, the Qingluo Merchant Company also had a bit of fame. Song Qingluo, who was almost an adult, was more beautiful than before, and coupled with her rise in status she was now a famous goddess in Heaven Wasteland Domain. Countless young admirers and people of major forces had crowded around and worn down the doorstep of the Song family to seek marriage, but unfortunately were all rejected by the goddess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some people had even tried to force Song Qingluo to marry through some tricks and power, but the end result for all of them was very miserable. The forces behind the Qingluo Merchant Company were incredibly powerful, and even had the shadows of authorities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I pay my respects to Lord Ye Qingyu.” Song Qingluo was slender and beautiful, and dressed in a water-green battle dress, she was as elegant as chrysanthemum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We're old friends, why be so polite?” Ye Qingyu invited her to sit down with a smile on his face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the beautiful and remarkable woman before him, Ye Qingyu immediately thought of Song Xiaojun, and couldn't help asking, “In these years, have you heard anything from Song Xiaojun? Have you ever been in touch with the Song family?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished, Ye Qingyu realized that there was no use in asking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because even he couldn’t locate where Song Xiaojun was, thus the Song family most likely would also know nothing. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what he did not expect was that Song Qinglo gently nodded and said, “Song Xiaojun, she... contacted me ten days ago.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu sprang up in shock——&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
