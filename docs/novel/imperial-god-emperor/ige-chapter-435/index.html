They had only seen that Gao Han had worn official garments, so she had bitterly begged him as a desperate measure. After, Gao Han had left, and the wife of Zhou Daiming was completely heartbroken. She felt more and more that there was no hope, so her heart had died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But she did not imagine that this person would really be able to bring her son back.</span></p>

Zhou Daiming's face was swollen and bruised, but he did not suffer serious injuries. As he placated his mother, he constantly wiped his tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The two gave their heartfelt and sincere thanks and gratitude towards Gao Han.</span></p>

I'm willing to risk it all, I am willing to be witness. I am willing to do anything you say..." Zhou Daiming came in front of Zhou Daiming, his attitude one that of completely sacrificing himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He was after all an instructor of a martial dojo. Normally, he conversed with others, and therefore knew a little bit about how the empire currently was, and his thinking was also nimble.</span></p>

The Gao Han who he had never seen before was willing to save himself, perhaps there was only one possible reason for this. And that was something to do with the Brute Race, and it was possibly related to the conflicts of the higher echelons of the different factions in the capital. If such a civilian like him was swept up into such a battle, then he would instantly be crushed into powder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But seeing the three corpses lying in the main hall of his family, Zhou Daiming did not care about anything. Even if he was utterly crushed, as long as he was able to obtain justice for his grandfather, his grandmother, and his pitiful younger sister, then what did it matter if he died?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Gao Han smiled.</span></p>

As long as we are clear on this, we do not need to waste our breath on the opposing parties. Take care of your parents, don't go and fight any pointless and meaningless battles. My Lord will give you justice."&nbsp;</span></p>

The girl of the Zhou family had killed herself by drowning in the river, while the other two were killed on the spot by the Brute Race. Of the other two, one was still currently unconscious and comatose and the other was the only girl of her family. She was carefully watched by her family, and had already attempted to take her own life tens of times, but was just saved by her family...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; These five families were all originally complete and happy commoner families. Although &nbsp;they could not be said to lack for nothing, but they were like many citizens of the empire. They lived on strongly, and had the little happiness that belonged to them. But such a little happiness was brutally and mercilessly destroyed just like that in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Gao Han carefully investigated the details of such a matter. With fury in his chest, he returned to the [Light Palace].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; On the way, he once again encountered many experts of the military as well as the leaders of many of the patrols camps responsible for different districts. They were currently investigating the whereabouts of the [Matchless Blade King] Qin Zhishui everywhere. Some of the gangs and sects within the capital had already been completely chased to a mess. A secret location that belonged to the Matchless Blade City within the capital was already broken apart by the military. But they were not able to capture the successor of the Matchless Blade City…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Within the capital, there was a strange aura of complete chaos and unrest.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Sitting at the edge of the stone palace, Ye Qingyu finished hearing Gao Han's description. The rage in his heart also could barely be suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After carefully thinking it over, Ye Qingyu made his decision. "It's nearly been a year. It's time for us to show our fangs. Otherwise people might really think that our [Light Palace] is really useful for nothing. Those people of the Brute Race are ruthless and unreasonable, and they come here after winning a war against the capital. This is the time when their sense of self will inflate the most. Even if we want to discuss peace, no good result will come with discussing peace with the Brute Race such an attitude. This time, I want all seven of the Envoys of Light to act. I want you to kill all those Brute Race soldiers who commited a crime, to break the arrogance of those Brutes. Make them know that this is the capital of the Human Race and not the den of the Brutes. We will absolutely not allow those Brutes to do as they please.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Gao Han was delighted as heard this. "I will carry out your orders."</span></p>

If it was like this, he would be helpless. But he had not imagined he would take such a hard stance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Such a decision unquestionably suited Gao Han's heart the most.</span></p>

It was as if he was burning in flames, having a natural air of authority around him. He had a warrior's overcoat cloaked over him. Even when just casually sitting there, he emitted a noble aura that belonged solely to an expert with high status.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was around two meters tall, and was somewhat similar to a strong human martial expert. His muscles were not as exaggerated as a normal Brute Race soldier, and he did not possess the rampant wild and rough aura of his Brute Race. Instead, he seemed somewhat elegant and gentle.&nbsp;</span></p>

A tiny little ice sword, to think it dared to pierce towards the area of the envoys so obviously? Those little bastards of the Human Race, were they looking to die again?&nbsp;</span></p>

They could clearly see, on the ground, that the ice patterns were like beautiful and fatal silver snakes. It seemed slow, but they crawled extremely quickly. In the blink of an eye, there was silver frost covering the entire ground of the tent, as well as the table, the chairs, and the canvas of the tent behind them.&nbsp;</span></p>
