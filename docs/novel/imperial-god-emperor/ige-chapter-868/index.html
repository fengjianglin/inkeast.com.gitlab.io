 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The door of the courtyard was made of ordinary mahogany, about two people high and the colour was somewhat faded. The paint surface was mottled, the door broken, and the entrance was covered up. With a push the door produced a shrill creaking sound. Ye Qingyu, under the leadership of Divine Guard Tang Chong, entered the abandoned ruins-like courtyard. He swept his eyes around only to see that there were crumbling fences, dilapidated walls, and overgrown weeds everywhere. It was hard to imagine there to be such a place in Heaven Connect City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu also didn't ask anything right away.&nbsp;</span></p>

The front courtyard and back courtyard were connected, and on the left and right there were two side courtyards. It occupied a total area of about five hundred square kilometers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The area of five hundred square kilometers was countless times larger than the previous stone building. According to Tang Chong, such an area was not too bad in comparison to the encampment area of the top forces. From the area point of view, it was a reasonable choice, but the problem was that there were weeds everywhere, the walls were mottled, cobwebs and dust were everywhere, and there were many corner eaves that had broken down. It seemed that one could blow down these courtyard walls with little effort. It was clear that there was no possibility of repair. If they chose this place for the encampment of Heaven Wasteland Domain, then it was necessary to rebuild the walls and fences.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The construction of an encampment site was not as simple as the repairing of houses by ordinary people. It requires a lot of materials, and the reinforcement of formations by top masters, as well as various prohibition formations. This project was extremely large, and given the physical resources and labour resources of the present Heaven Wasteland Domain, it was basically impossible to complete within a short period of time. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu heaved a sigh, exchanged a glance with the Great Dragon Turtle Demon, but did not speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Ye Qingyu was thinking of, the Great Dragon Turtle Demon also thought of.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two were a little hesitant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taking another lap around the courtyard, Ye Qingyu found another strange thing——As he walked through the ruins in front of the hall, there was a chilly breeze blowing about that he could not help but shiver. It was absolutely not normal. Given Ye Qingyu's present cultivation level, he would not tremble like that even in a world of ice and snow. That gust of chilly wind contained a very bizarre energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu stood in the front hall for a good while, and did not seem to sense anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Although this courtyards has been abandoned, but from the foundation point of view, it must have been extremely grand back then and should have an impressive history, right?” Ye Qingyu cast a thoughtful look at Tong Chong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord Ye Qingyu really is intelligent and can discern what others cannot. Indeed, this was [Guanlan Mountain Manor], which used to be a residence of a Human Race Quasi-emperor in Heaven Connect City. In its flourishing period, not only was this a mountain manor, but within every fifty kilometers of the mountain manor, there were forces of [Guanlan Mountain Manor]. Outsiders did not dare to enter. Unfortunately, I was not able to see its grand state with my own eyes. When I came to the Divine Guard of the Domain Alliance, this was already abandoned, but it was rumoured that the Human Race Quasi-emperor was unrivalled in power and strength. He was a fierce person and his deterrent power was above that of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]. The thousands of races would all cowardly retreat upon hearing his name. Unfortunately, something happened and he went missing. [Guanlan Mountain Manor] was turned into ruins, abandoned for countless years, and become like this now...” Tang Chong sighed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was such a history to this manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A look of astonishment crossed Ye Qingyu's face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An unknown Human Race Quasi-emperor? &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why did it sound a bit ridiculous? If he were really a Human Race Quasi-emperor then he should not be unknown, right? And from Tang Chong's point of view, the Quasi-emperor had a more terrifying deterrent power than [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], and should not be summed up with the word ‘unknown’. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But from the tone and manner of Tang Chong, it should not be false. The white-robed divine guard seemed to not know anything more and Ye Qingyu did not question further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in any case, the information was enough to indicate that the ruins in front of them were really not that simple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since it has such an amazing past then why has it been abandoned?” Ye Qingyu asked again after a thought, “Did no other people wanted this place after the disappearance of the Human Race Quasi-emperor? This area was after all a rare quiet place in Heaven Connect City, which is surrounded by mountains and trees, and the area is so large...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Chong looked at Ye Qingyu, seemingly hesitant, and finally answered, “Of course there were people who wanted to repair and restore [Guanlan Mountain Manor], unfortunately...” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unfortunately what?” Ye Qingyu felt that there was a hidden meaning in Tang Chong's words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unfortunately they all turned crazy in the end.” Tang Chong no longer concealed anything and directly explained, “In the past years, there was a total of eight prominent people who wanted to construct a mansion here, but something strange happened, and they ended up in a miserable state. Ever since a heaven's prideling of the Demon Race turned crazy, no other beings dared to stay here. This is what I read in some ancient books. To this day, these ruins had been abandoned for more than thousands of years, and there were often strange occurrences. Ordinary people simply dared not to come close to this place, and no one dared to take over the area. Therefore, the surroundings are very quiet. I do not know why the Domain Alliance designated this area as one of the choices of encampment site for Heaven Wasteland Domain.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu nodded when he finished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Chong did not know why, but Ye Qingyu had figured it out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were still people in the Domain Alliance who couldn't stand the Human Race and Heaven Wasteland Domain doing well, and were deliberately making things difficult for them. The first site was small and pitiful, and the average person would not choose that stone building. However they do not want to give a better choice for Heaven Wasteland Domain, so they simply gave them the choice of this dangerous location. By doing so it seemed that, on the surface, Heaven Wasteland Domain was given a choice, when in fact there was only the stone building that can be selected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu stood at the door of the courtyard, silent for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Dragon Turtle Demon also kept quiet, fury bubbling inside him, but he also did not say anything when he saw Ye Qingyu's expression.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two choices were obviously not very ideal, but the good thing was that the first site was located in the bustling area of Heaven Connect City, which was not far from the Domain Alliance Temple and had good transportation. Although Heaven Wasteland Domain had already passed the domain assessment, but based on their present strength and power they were still very weak. Thus there was no need to send too many people to stay in the encampment. And in the future, this encampment of Heaven Wasteland Domain had more symbolism purpose than a substantive role. Although the stone building was small, it was also enough for them.&nbsp;</span></p>

Thinking about that breeze of gloomy wind from before, Ye Qingyu actually believed completely in Tang Chong's words and had a great curiosity in the legendary secret. Vaguely, Ye Qingyu guessed that Ren Puyang must also know something, but did not make it clear and still let Tang Chong bring him here. Perhaps there was a deeper meaning to it.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

Releasing his consciousness power, he swept his gaze across and examined around, before he left with the Great Dragon Turtle Demon and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, everybody boarded the airship and flew back. &nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Chong looked surprised upon hearing this, “Lord Ye Qingyu, you want to buy [Guanlan Mountain Manor] ruins? Don’t be reckless, you must think twice. This is a dangerous place and something strange will happen to whoever that lives there. The geniuses and Lords that did not believe in this all ended up in a miserable state. Lord Ye Qingyu, you...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu smiled and interrupted him, “Commander Tang Chong you're thinking too much, even if I buy it I do not necessarily have to live there... I'm just asking.”</span></p>

Thus he was a little worried that this human genius would become arrogant because everything had been going smoothly, and make the mistake of entering [Guanlan Mountain Manor].&nbsp;</span></p>

No one had asked about it for thousands of years, the price most likely had fallen to its lowest point. Of course you can buy it but... please forgive me for speaking out of turn... it would be better for Lord Ye Qingyu to not have any thoughts on buying this land.”&nbsp;</span></p>

He issued a series of orders, and the matters were methodically carried out——&nbsp;</span></p>
