 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the situation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arriving a little late, the fatty Li Shengyan descended among flickering flowing light, somewhat confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could not understand how several hundred thousand experts from various races could, much like children being disciplined by their granddaddy, actually be put in order by a dozen or so petty officials of the Four Stars Sect. At least, based on their apparent strength, any one of them could alone beat the crap out of these petty officials.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could these petty officials be in possession of some world-awing precious treasure?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pitiful fatty had been chased like a dog in recent days and, like Ye Qingyu, had not been hearing much news. On top of that, he arrived late and thus completely did not know what happened below Capital Sky Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s save these people before talking.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Ye Qingyu lifted Orchid Saintess up, an ice-cold longsword appeared in his hand. He then rapidly stepped forth with a sword light striking out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Below the Capital Sky Peak, a silver sword light dazzled all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a sword in hand, Ye Qingyu went merciless on all evil spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without even working up the [Limitless Divine Way], fighting against the surrendered experts was as easy as cutting melons and cabbages to him. Nobody could catch hold of his tracks or clearly see the profound arc of those wisps of flickering sword light. The only thing they could see clearly was that whenever a wisp of sword light arose, an enemy of Ye Qingyu would be killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A single sword light could chill nineteen domains!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within an instant, Ye Qingyu's figure reappeared beside Orchid Saintess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps, in the eyes of the crowd, it was as if he had never left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only change was that an image had flashed and his body had become airy for a moment before solidifying again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the boundless sword light which was so dazzling that it could not be looked straight at, it suddenly receded and reverted to an ice sword which fell into Ye Qingyu's hands. When Ye Qingyu's five fingers opened, a beautiful scene like that of flowers blooming appeared. The ice sword turned into snowflakes which fluttered like fairies and dissipated among the Void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A heavenly wind circulated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The near-hundred surrendered experts who had been restraining Tan Tianzi, Zhang Wudao and the others were now standing stiffly on the spot like wooden carvings</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bam bam!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bouts of soft knocking noises rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bodies of the surrendered experts suddenly ruptured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among them were many Half-Step Great Saints, yet their bodies had ruptured even before they had moved, their auras had arisen, their blades had been unsheathed, or the expressions on their faces had even changed. This kind of rupturing was not a tragic sight of flesh and blood flying and bones bursting out. Instead, at the moment when each of these bodies – whether human or otherwise - ruptured, it turned into dazzling flakes of ice crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sharp rays of light refracted into a motley of colors under the sunlight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As these dream-like colors circulated, they formed the very picture of myriad fatal yet beautiful flowers of death blooming profusely under the Capital Sky Peak!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrendered experts who had struck out and surrounded Tan Tianzi and the others were totally wiped out within a breath’s time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tan Tianzi, Zhang Wudao, and the others, who had been carrying some anxiety along with their wild joy, afraid that Ye Qingyu would bring about his own doom by doing what he was doing, had by now been so astounded that they could barely speak. It must be known that this was a true case of one versus hundred. Although the near-hundred surrendered experts had forsaken their self-respect and glory, they were nevertheless Saints who had fought in hundreds of battles and possessed rich battle experience, and when they joined forces with one another, even pinnacle Great Saints would have to admit defeat to them. The Celestial Race Great Saint earlier served as an example.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was hence unexpected that they would disappear in a flash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What sort of method is this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Surely I’m not dreaming?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Jieqian subconsciously rubbed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kind of battle technique and strength could no longer be described as “unexpected” or “shocking”, but rather was so terrifying that they made one’s flesh and bones turn cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Orchid Saintess had wanted to say a few more words of thanks, but could not even speak a word at present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because, this heroine, who all along would rather die than submit, suddenly found that she had lost the courage to talk to the handsome white-robed youth beside her. This was an instinctive fear towards experts, and it caused her mind to be in a mixed state of vacancy and confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To one side, Tan Tianzi was also like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the other hundreds of thousands of experts, they were of course also terribly astounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Practically none of them had clearly seen how Ye Qingyu attacked, and could only tell that it was an excessively atrocious, even world-shocking, method which slayed nearly a hundred surrendered experts in a breath’s time. Many began to wonder if this white-robed youth was actually a Quasi-emperor, and if so, why they had not heard of his emergence before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was not long before someone identified Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a din among the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s Ye Qingyu, the third deputy of the Human Race.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The [Ice Sword Killing God]?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How’s that possible? The legendary Ye Qingyu isn’t said to be this strong. How could he have become so frightening?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As all kinds of discussions were heard, the experts from various races became ever more shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were beginning to doubt their own outlook on life, and felt that their world view had been turned upside down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the mountain path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strong winds were blowing high up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting cross-legged, the Third Prince of the Mizar Race suddenly opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An alarming battle will suddenly spurted from his eyes, giving the impression that flames were burning in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ye Qingyu has indeed turned up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin Kaishan gradually stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the experts below Capital Sky Peak were the elite talents from various races throughout the Vast Thousand Domains, they were nothing more than a bunch of clay sculptures in his eyes. The only person who whetted his appetite for battle was none other than Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hundreds of thousands of Heaven’s pridelings could not compare to Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the latter appeared, Yin Kaishan had restrained his battle will and remained as unmoved as a monolith.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But after Ye Qingyu displayed his immense strength, Yin Kaishan instantly felt his chest burning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finding it hard to suppress his battle will, he picked up his long spear and was about to head down the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Four Stars holy girl shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t go.” With ice-cold and indifferent eyes, she was looking at the countless experts at the foot of the mountain as if she was looking at pawns on a chessboard. “It’s not time yet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After glancing sideways at the woman whom he swooned over and briefly hesitating, he nodded and went back to sitting cross-legged among the wind and snow. He then closed his eyes like an old monk going into a state of zen. Having obtained a supreme opportunity and immense gains while he was in the Reincarnation Hall, he needed to use every second and minute possible for fusion and refinement so as to enhance himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew very well that, at present, he had definitely not reached his strongest peak state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Yin Kaishan in his current posture, the Four Stars holy girl let out a faint sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A hint of apology indistinctly manifested in her beautiful eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry, Elder Brother Yin Kaishan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She silently sighed in her inner depths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She understood this man all too well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This indomitable, imposing man possessed a righteous, honorable, and resolute heart, and could pass for a fearless martial god. Unfortunately for him, having followed beside her for so long, he had inevitably been corroded by darkness, and had to go against his own conscience to indulge her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All this time, as ruthless as she was when dealing with others, the Four Stars holy girl had maintained a sense of warmth and care toward him. This was because she could not be any clearer that if there was one person in this world who treated her with sincerity and would never betray her, it would be none other than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She sighed inwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, her mood had also fluctuated at the very moment when she saw Ye Qingyu appearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as only Yin Kaishan could make her feel warm, Ye Qingyu was the only person in this world who could make her helpless and even fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two men each had a special and distinctive place in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she stood among the piercingly-cold winds and snow, she could not help recalling the scene when she first met Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who would have thought that the unknown little fellow from a Human Race lower domain struggling desperately back then on the Taowu Mountain Ridge would, after such a long period of time, become her nightmare?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And in the form of an aberration which she had attempted to deal with several times yet frustrated her each time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But… things are different this time. Ye Qingyu, your myth shall end here. I shall let your glory reach its peak on this peak, but after that, it’ll become nothing more than a legend for posterity, while you shall become a stepping stone of mine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She gazed at the white-robed, black-haired man at the foot of the mountain for dozens of breaths’ worth of time before turning to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If they come up the mountain, don’t obstruct them, Elder Brother Yin Kaishan. Should anything happen, you may return to the Mizar Race first,” she transmitted as her graceful figure vanished among the wind and snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re Ye Qingyu?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young petty official was already gradually calming down from his shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he stood among the crowd of surrendered experts and received the protection of nearly ten thousand elite martial experts, he felt a sense of safety once more. Recalling his panic-stricken embarrassment of that earlier moment, an uncontrollable anger arose in his heart. He raised a hand and pointed at Ye Qingyu, yelling, “So it was you, hehe. I’d thought that you’ve already been hunted down since you didn’t appear for more than ten days, but it turns out that you actually managed to extend your feeble existence. This is simply wonderful. Her Highness the holy girl has wanted your head for a long time. Haha, to think that this outstanding contribution shall be left to our brothers to perform. Hahahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other petty officials also revealed looks of delight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those words had been spot on, for every sect member knew of the holy girl’s wish to kill Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, given their status, they naturally would not dare to have any hopes of accomplishing a feat like this. However, things were different now. Under the control of the [Three Corpse Yuan-Stealing Pill], nearly ten thousand Saint experts would follow their orders. Moreover, the deterrence offered by the Four Stars Quasi-emperor ensured that the other hundreds of thousands of experts would certainly not dare to help Ye Qingyu. As such, by manipulating this large army and sacrificing a good part of it, they would surely be able to wear Ye Qingyu down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, even if it was not to claim merit from the Four Stars holy girl, the deed of killing the [Ice Sword Killing God] who had awed the Road of Chaos, once spread, would allow these ten petty officials to make a name for themselves and leave behind a legendary tale among the Vast Thousand Domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the saying went, ‘life is all about fame and fortune’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could they not reap this massive opportunity for fame and fortune?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go, I want all of you to go and exhaust him to death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha, that’s right. Everyone, attack and kill Ye Qingyu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more they thought, the more frenzied and feverish they became. Like red-eyed gamblers, they began to shout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In particular, the young petty official’s countenance was already somewhat distorted and hideous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under such orders, the surrendered experts dared not show the least bit of defiance and hesitation, instantly turning into dazzling flowing light and charging toward Ye Qingyu from various directions, thereby forming what looked like a scene of black onrushing torrents. Their surging yuan qi overlapped with one another, becoming wild and frightening to an extreme, while the atmosphere instantly ignited and became riotous. Although they had never practiced combination techniques and thus things were a mess, being top-level experts after all, they possessed incomparably rich battle experience and innate abilities which when combined were difficult to withstand even by Golden Immortal Daluo himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Retreat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu waved his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tan Tianzi, Orchid Saintess, Zhang Wudao and the others, who had wanted to fight till death alongside Ye Qingyu, felt a wave of immense power onrushing irresistibly and pushing them back several kilometers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the divine splendor, the [Blood Drinker Sword Pill] appeared in Ye Qingyu's hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You all still lack sufficient status and weight to lend His Highness Xiaofei a helping hand. But since that’s the case, you all may be able to obtain them from this battle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As battle will burned in his heart, Ye Qingyu advanced instead of retreating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a sword in hand, no evil spirits shall be spared!</span></p>
