 <p>Chapter 1082, The Great ancient dragon emperor</p>
 <p>“Mister Ye Qingyu, we finally meet.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The current Emperor of the Dragon Human Race smiled, his tone of voice was as though he was seeing an old friend.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was aware of Ye Qingyu's real strength and cultivation base. The battle of the mourning hall of the Domain Alliance obviously could not be concealed from the powerful Dragon Human Emperor. It was because he knew this that he was so respectful. The Vast Thousand Domains was a world of martial arts, where the strongest was well-respected. Given Ye Qingyu's strength, even in front of the Dragon Human Emperor, he was on equal level. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Emperor looked about thirty or forty years old, in his prime age, with a wide mouth and bright eyes, plumped cheeks and a straight nose. His long violet and gold hair hid a pair of gold-violet dragon horns. He exuded a powerful imposing manner, like a fierce general charging on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu along with the uneasy Zhou Yuexin entered into the main hall.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the main hall there was only the Dragon Human Emperor. The formations on the walls, stone pillars, the ground, carvings, steps and every place were in a state of invisibility. It was clear that the Dragon Human Emperor wanted to talk with Ye Qingyu alone.</p>
 <p>The bodyguard commander took Zhou Yuexin out of the main hall and closed the door behind him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The whole hall was in a state of isolation. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was only the bold and daring Ye Qingyu who could remain calm and composed in such a situation. “Your Majesty, I wonder what is the reason you summoned me here?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Dragon Human Emperor got down from the upper throne, standing on the same level as Ye Qingyu and said with a smile, “Uncle Wuya had discussed the great events on the Capital Sky Peak with me, I know what had happened on the Capital Sky Peak and I have also heard about the battle at Mister Ren Puyang's funeral.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s eyes were flowing with a wisp of brilliance, understanding dawning on his face. “So... the Dragon Human War God Xu Wuya is standing on Your Majesty's side. The arrangements outside, the so-called ‘the world is divided into three’, General Xu Wuya's separation, all these are a deceptive appearance?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Mister Ye Qingyu is indeed intelligent, and saw right through the truth,” the Dragon Human Emperor nodded and frankly admitted</p>
 <p>When he was speaking, he was in fact carefully observing Ye Qingyu's expression. He saw that after he was taken aback for a moment he immediately became incredibly calm. In the whole process his mind was as still as water. He couldn’t help but think that this Human Race genius was most likely more terrifying than rumoured. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I see.” Ye Qingyu's assessment of the Dragon Human Emperor was increased a lot. “Your Majesty's strategy is remarkable.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In fact, before this, Ye Qingyu's evaluation of the Dragon Human Emperor was not too high. The imperial court left by the former Dragon Human Race’s Supreme Emperor could be described as having a powerful influence, and absolutely could be counted as at its peak. But the present Dragon Human Emperor did not advance or retreat, letting the Dragonblood imperial court fall apart. Even the meritorious Marquis were governed by doing nothing, and even the Dragon Human Race God Emperor had declared secession, and disobeyed the imperial orders. Even if there was external turbulence, according to common sense, it should not have deteriorated to such a degree overnight. At that time, Ye Qingyu's speculation was that the Dragon Human Emperor’s incompetence caused the deterioration of the imperial court.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But now it seemed that all this was a deceptive appearance. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>The vassal alliance may have really betrayed the Emperor, but the most important Dragon Human War God Xu Wuya was unexpectedly still secretly listening to the orders of the Dragon Human Emperor. The so-called ‘the world had split into three’ was just a deceptive appearance. The Dragon Tooth Army, who on the surface had split from the Emperor, will become a target of the vassal alliance. It could be imagined that, given Xu Wuya's ability, it must be possible for him to extract a steady stream of resources and information from the alliance and gain knowledge of the movements of the other side.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Dragon Human Emperor's method allowed him to cleanly squeeze out the worth of the unstable alliance silently, use it to nourish the Dragon Tooth Army, but without using the financial resources of the Dragonblood imperial court, and did not need to worry that the unstable alliance would really attack the Dragonblood imperial court..</p>
 <p>If all this was the strategy set by the Emperor, then his ability and mind can really be called terrifying.</p>
 <p>More importantly, the Dragon Human War God, Xu Wuya, had chosen to stand on the Emperor’s side, which showed that even Xu Wuya fully agreed with and followed the will of the Dragon Human Emperor.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not doubt the words of the Dragon Human Emperor.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An Emperor was a supreme existence, whose every word carried great weight.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although the Emperor of the Dragon Human Race was not a martial arts Emperor, he still carried the mandate of heaven, was worshipped by the Dragon Human Race, and radiated imperial qi. In the face of an expert like Ye Qingyu, if he were to lie, then that would be the same as destroying his feathers. If he had not secretly communicated with Xu Wuya, then there was no way he would know so much information, and also would not know that they had reached the Peerless Dragon City.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu still had some puzzlement.</p>
 <p>If even Xu Wuya had completely stood on the side of the Dragon Human Emperor, then there was no need to arrange for the world to split into three. Ye Qingyu had seen the strength of the vassal alliance, if the Dragon Tooth Army were to go into battle, then it was most likely that in less than half a year they could completely destroy the alliance. Why would they do something absolutely unnecessary and make things too complicated?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Could there be another reason for this?</p>
 <p>This most likely was the reason why the Dragon Human Emperor invited Ye Qingyu here today.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu quietly waited.</p>
 <p>“After [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], I did not expect there to be another peerless genius emerged in the Human Race.” In the tone of the Dragon Human Emperor there was undisguised envy. “Ever since ancient times, every time the Human Race had encountered a low point, there was always an exceptional genius who reversed the tides. In this era they have Mister Ye Qingyu.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty is overpraising me.” Ye Qingyu smiled and then asked directly, “What did Your Majesty ask me to come here for?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Dragon Human Emperor also smiled, “Then for what reason did Mister Ye Qingyu come to my Peerless Dragon City for?”</p>
 <p>“Chase down the murderer,” Ye Qingyu spoke frankly and concisely.</p>
 <p>The Dragon Human Emperor broke into a hearty laughter, “I asked Mister Ye Qingyu to come here to assist you in chasing down the murderer.”</p>
 <p>“In other words, our purpose is the same?” Ye Qingyu said. “But how did Your Majesty know who the murderer is?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Dragon Human Emperor's expression grew serious, “If I am not mistaken, it is an existence of my clan. Mister Ye Qingyu, am I right?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;Ye Qingyu this time really was a little surprised, “Your Majesty also knows?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Of course I know.” The Dragon Human Emperor sighed grievously. “How prosperous was my Dragon Human Race, back then it was one of the strongest powers of the Vast Thousand Domains, but now it had fallen to such a state, all because of that Granduncle.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was such a matter?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu immediately realized that the secret of the Dragon Human Race was more astonishing than he had imagined.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Who Your Majesty is talking about, is the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor?” Ye Qingyu simply got straight to the point.</p>
 <p>The Dragon Human Emperor nodded, “That’s correct... haha, after I found out that Mister Ye Qingyu had come to the Peerless Dragon City, I immediately understood that Mister Ye Qingyu must have come for Granduncle and must have found some clues.”</p>
 <p>“But as far as I know, the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor was the one who revived the Dragon Human Race, is the God of the Dragon Human Race, who had turned the tide, and had saved thousands of beings of the Dragon Human Domain,” Ye Qingyu questioned. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Maybe it used to be, but not anymore now.” The expression on the face of the Dragon Human Emperor was extremely grievous. That expression was not faked, but was one of deep helplessness, grief and indignation. “In this world, there are always illustrious people falling into darkness for a variety of reasons. This Granduncle is no exception. He was once the heroic god of the Dragon Human Race, the guardian of the entire clan, but now he had become a destroyer who had fallen into darkness. The deterioration of the Dragonblood imperial court is all caused by this Granduncle. If it were only the vassal alliance, do you think I would be so troubled? To sweep them away would only take a few days.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu understood.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was why the Dragon Human Emperor had worked so hard to set up the arrangement.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If it was so, then this could explain everything.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“In other words, the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor had not gone?” Ye Qingyu asked again.</p>
 <p>The Dragon Human Emperor shook his head, “The Granduncle of the past is dead. The him now is merely a walking corpse that has had his shell occupied by dark forces, and cannot be freed, bringing disaster to the Dragon Human Domain.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If he had not guessed wrong, then the present state of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor was perhaps similar to that of Wei Wubing and Zhang Wuxin, or more bizarre. But in essence, he had been corrupted by the power of the dark domain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Where is he?” Ye Qingyu asked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Dragon Human Emperor: “In the Peerless Dragon City.”</p>
 <p>“The Dragon Human Race's ancestral mausoleum?” Ye Qingyu asked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Dragon Human Emperor nodded. “Correct, Granduncle had occupied the ancestral mausoleum, absorbed the Dragon qi, but also absorbed the imperial qi of the imperial court. His power is increasingly enhanced. I have gathered many experts to enter the ancestral mausoleum to investigate, but they never returned. The ancestral mausoleum had become a dragon cave, had become the forbidden land of my Dragon Human Race. It really is lamentable and hateful.”</p>
 <p>It turned out to be so.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu thought of Wei Wubing and Zhang Wuxin, who drew upon the qi of the heavens and earth for re-cultivation, to change their shell, especially the latter who cultivated the Dragon Human Race techniques. It seemed that it was the same with the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor, except that what he saught was even greater. He had been absorbing the dragon qi in the Dragon tomb, as well as the imperial qi of the empire.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Imperial qi was the qi of the Emperor.</p>
 <p>Although it was different from the power of martial arts, but it still had its mysteriousness. Back then the forces of the Black Moon Immortal Palace could not do anything to Yu Xiaoxing because she had imperial qi to protect her body. The Greater One Sect also failed to obtain the coordinates of Heaven Wasteland Domain from her under the protection of the imperial qi.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Great Ancient Dragon Emperor was originally part of the royal family. After he obtained the imperial qi it was even more difficult to predict what kind of change would happen.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was no wonder that the Dragon Human Emperor was so agitated and indignant. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Therefore, the reason Your Majesty invited me here is to join hands with me, to enter the ancestral mausoleum, kill the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor, and to solve the trouble of the Dragon Human Race?” Ye Qingyu asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes, that's correct, I ask Mister Ye Qingyu to assist me.” The Dragon Human Emperor said, “As long as it can help free Granduncle, bring peace to my Dragon Human Domain, our people are willing to work with the Heaven Wasteland Empire, form a lifelong alliance and will never betray you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;Ye Qingyu nodded, “Good, this was also my wish.”</p>
 <p>He originally had planned to enter the Dragon Human ancestral mausoleum to chase down the culprit, but now with the cooperation of the Dragon Human Emperor, it would definitely save him a lot of trouble——&nbsp;</p>
