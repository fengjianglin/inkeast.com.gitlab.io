 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He took several step forwards. "Demonic girl, just where do you think this is. For me to tolerate your appearance is already showing mercy. To think you would even dare bring Lord Ye away, just what do you think the [Light Palace] is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's right, the identity of Palace Lord Ye is special, he must not go with you to the Unomving City of Darkness," Qu Hanshan said by the side with a frown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Palace Lord Ye is moral and righteous. If he entered into the Unmoving City of Darkness, will he not be tainted? If you are really being considerate of Palace Lord Ye, then don't cause chaos," there were several other people that shouted in unison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Surround her!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Those experts that had survived quickly surrounded her with great hustle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The fatty Wang Lijin did not know the intricacies of the situation. He only brought the soldiers he had commanded and pretended to take a step or two forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "A bunch of shameless people." Song Xiaojun was so angry that she smiled instead. "The greater good that you regard so highly, the accomplishments of the Human Race that you regard so highly - for this you are willing to casually sacrifice others. But you are all the complete appearance of guiltlessness. Brother Qingyu did so much for you people, but you are not grateful, but still care about that dogfart righteousness and name. What does this matter? Even if the Unmoving City of Darkness is able to save brother Qingyu, you are still not letting him go, is that right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; There were some people that lowered their heads in shame.</span></p>

Even if we allow you to bring him away, if you bring him away, you are causing harm to Palace Lord Ye... could it be that you want Palace Lord Ye to end up the same as you, descending eternally within the Unmoving City of Darkness?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Song Xiaojun took a step forward, killing intent exploded, "Old dog, what darkness and light. is this something a frog in the well like you can define? Today, I will definitely bring him away. Whoever wants to stop me, they can test the power of the Black Lotus Radiance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As she said this, the black lotus flames surrounding the young girl surged. She took large strides forwards.</span></p>

This was especially so after Lin Zheng and Yu Feiyan could faintly guess at his identity and the relations he had. Even if they risked their lives, they could not allow Ye Qingyu to be carried away in such a situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Song Xiaojun, upon seeing this, the killing intent in her eyes burned.</span></p>

Her strength was originally powerful and she became conscious quicker than Lu Heng had originally estimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; With her wisdom and cleverness, seeing the scene, she instantly realized something.</span></p>

Yu Xiaoxing struggled to jump up, rushing to Song Xiaojun and the others. Loudly shouting, "Retreat, everyone retreat..."</span></p>

In her eyes, there was only fear and sorrow. Lifting her head and shouting, "Retreat, all of you retreat. Don't stop her, let her take brother Qingyu away, no one is to stop her!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "But Princess, that demonic girl is the darkness..." Lin Zheng frowned, wanting to say something.</span></p>

"I don't care, I don't care about such things. Darkness or Light, it has nothing to do with me. I only want my brother Qingyu to live on, I only want him to live. I don't care about other matters, if Song Xiaojun is able to save brother Qingyu, then let her bring brother Qingyu away... move away, all of you move away!"</span></p>

One's heart could not help but ache.</span></p>

She did not have the deviousness and mischievousness she had, without the calmness that she had at Youyan Pass. In these past years, the [Painting Saint] Liu Yuqing had made her train her heart and mental state. At this moment, it had completely turned into ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Yu Xiaoxing at this moment was like a gambler that had wagered everything she had. Her eyes looked fixedly on the body of Ye Qingyu in ice that Song Xiaojun had in her embrace, forgetting about everything else.</span></p>

Lin Zheng was still a minister in front of Yu Xiaoxing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, most important, with Yu Xiaoxing's identity, she was not only just the Princess.

It's best that you don't interfere." Yu Feiyan also opened his mouth.“</span></p>

Yu Xiaoxing wiped away her tears, then suddenly straightened her figure. Her expression became unprecedentedly determined, saying word by word, no room to bend at all, "My words don't have effect when I speak with the identity of a Princess? Fine, then I'll switch to another identity..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As she said this, there was a flash in her palm. There was a golden Imperial seal that appeared, nine dragons carved around the jade. The Imperial aura roiled as she said unquestionably, "Right now, as the Crown Prince of the Empire, I order you to retreat, don't block her. Do you understand?"</span></p>
