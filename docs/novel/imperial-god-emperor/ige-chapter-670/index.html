 <p>Chapter 670, Demon God Snow Mountain</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Daytime.</p>
 <p>Clear weather.</p>
 <p>The huge Snow Dragon Battleship pierced through the sea of silvery clouds.</p>
 <p>Under the sunlight in the high sky, it was like a huge silver monster advancing through the ocean waves, all the way to the Northern border, in the direction of the Snow Ground Demon Court.</p>
 <p>Once one stepped into the territory of the Snow Ground Demon Court, the scenery was very different.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was Ye Qingyu's second time in the Snow Ground Demon Court's territory. Compared to the last when he sneaked in, he was always on tenterhooks, but this time he was extremely calm, everything was within his grasp. He even had the mood to stand on the bow of the giant Snow Dragon Battleship, overlooking the vast world of ice and snow below.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The snowy world that was wrapped in a unique silver colour re-emerged in Ye Qingyu’s line of sight.</p>
 <p>An hour later. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Snow Dragon Battle ship came to the overhead of a barren winterland of snow and ice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the midst of the vast and boundless undulating white light, there was a huge sunken place on the lower ground. There were a number of barrier-like ice layers stretching across the snowy depressions. These strange shapes of ice towered into clouds, thick as walls, forming a natural barrier as though created by nature, overlooking from the sky, and looked incomparably magnificent.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stood on the deck of the battleship, and when he saw the area, he could not help feeling emotional.</p>
 <p>The historic Snow Dragon lair area.</p>
 <p>The scene of him straying into a Snow Dragon's lair with Little Nine once again surfaced in his mind.</p>
 <p>The Snow Dragon King who was still asleep, the underground Snow Dragon grave, the woman in the ice coffin, as well as that extremely mysterious divine soul...&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The mysterious divine soul of millions of years ago had not appeared since in the ruins of the Formation Sovereign Luo Su, but some of the mysterious existences in the Snow Dragon lair were still a great temptation to Ye Qingyu. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“After this matter is settled, I have to go to the Snow Dragon lair again... maybe there will be some harvest this time.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu thoughtfully looked towards the direction of the ice cave, slowly withdrawing his divine sense.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After passing the Snow Dragon lair area, the speed of the Snow Dragon battleship accelerated significantly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The weather and atmosphere of the snowy land changed oddly fast, and in the blink of an eye, the clear sky was shrouded in snow and ice. A storm of ice crystals visible to the naked eye was like an evil dragon wandering around the sky and earth, tearing the world of snow and ice, as it came sweeping over in the distance. The distant icy storm was mixed with sharp blades- and dagger-like ice crystals coming towards the Snow Dragon. It was like the doomsday of the snowy land.</p>
 <p>But the icy storm was melted away upon contact with the layer of glossy ice crystal scales on the body of the Snow Dragon.</p>
 <p>That was the beauty of the Snow Dragon battleship.</p>
 <p>It was half an hour before the storm slowly passed away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu couldn't help lamenting that in the territory under the rule of the Snow Ground Demon Court, the natural environment really was too harsh.</p>
 <p>In this environment, it was only inherently strong species like the demon clan that could survive. If the Human Race were to live here, it most likely would not take much time for them to be wiped out completely.</p>
 <p>Time went by.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The snowy scenery below was becoming more and more magnificent and mysterious.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The towering and majestic icy mountains pierced straight into the sky, and a number of sword-like icy mountain peaks, sheathed in thick clouds and mist, added a touch of mysteriousness and beauty. &nbsp;Among the cracks in the ice layers between the mountains, hanging upside down on the edge, were thousands of ice crystal waterfalls, carefully crafted by the icy storm, all in different shapes. They were like surging waves that had solidified in the ocean.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was a biting cold stretch of boundless land, where plants and grass did not grow, leaving only the land of ice and snow.</p>
 <p>Rumble!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>From time to time there was an icy peak suddenly collapsing due to the storm.</p>
 <p>Large areas of ice forests were instantly crushed, countless avalanches tumbled down in all directions, stirring up a burst of snowy fog into the air, rolling across the sky.</p>
 <p>The world in front that was covered by ice and snow, and every kind of scenery was formed from ice and now, was incredibly strange and mysterious.</p>
 <p>This changeable snowy environment was indeed like an illusion.</p>
 <p>But at this time, standing in the world of ice and snow, Ye Qingyu let out a gentle sigh.</p>
 <p>Half a day later.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Snow Dragon Battleship that sped all the way, gradually slowed down.</p>
 <p>In the distance, shrouded by snowy mist, a very towering, huge mountain came into the sight of Ye Qingyu. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Human, ahead is the Demon God Snow Mountain.” Standing on the other side of the battleship in silence, and dared not to take a step away from Ye Qingyu, Deputy General White Bear Demon ordered someone to fire a dark red formation signal into the sky.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The blood-red formation light shot straight through the layers of clouds, instantly staining a stretch of clouds crimson red.</p>
 <p>At the same time——&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu！</p>
 <p>Opposite, the mountain peaks, hidden among the clouds of ice and snow, responded to the very long and deep bugle sound.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A strange sight appeared. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the distance.</p>
 <p>Wrapped around the mountain peaks, the barrier-like snowy mist, as if guided by the bugle sound, quickly retreated to both sides.</p>
 <p>The Demon God Snow Mountain, like a snow beauty hiding behind the curtain of ice and snow, finally revealed its true face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was also shaken by the sight before him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was a majestic mountain peak that could not even be described with the words ‘grand’ and ‘spectacular’.</p>
 <p>The peak towered into the skies, seeming to extend to the end of the sky, almost merging into one.</p>
 <p>This Demon God Snow Mountain was not at all like an ordinary stretch of continuous snowy peaks.</p>
 <p>It was isolated, icy cold and proud, like a giant sword, standing alone at the end of the ice field. It looked like a giant in an ice-silver armour, overlooking the vast land of ice and snow. The rugged icy cliffs were extremely steep, as though carved by the ice knife and giant ice axe of nature. Between the glacial cliffs, hundreds of meters long icicles were sparkling like jade, glowing with a white and flawless light, as well as an icy waterfall flowing out swiftly.</p>
 <p>The natural feature unique to the snowy land made the entire ice peak sculpture appear more exquisite.</p>
 <p>Far away, the frozen waterfalls, like a silver flying dragon, dominated this vast snowy area.</p>
 <p>The Snow Dragon battleship constantly drew nearer to the Demon God Snow Mountain.</p>
 <p>What looked so close was actually far. The Demon God Snow Mountain that looked within reach took the Snow Dragon battleship half an hour to finally only reach thousand of meters within the foot of the mountain.</p>
 <p>The height of the flight of the Snow Dragon battleship was about five thousand meters from the ground, but as it neared the Demon God Snow Mountain, it was only at the height of the foothills.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was really shaken again. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>This Demon God Snow Mountain was too spectacular and too vast, just like an immemorial divine mountain that connected the sky and the ground.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Half an hour later.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Having passed through dozens of rounds of demon guard inspections, the Snow Dragon battleship had officially entered the borders of the Demon God Snow Mountain.</p>
 <p>The battleship slowed down and began to land on a naturally formed ice square between the mountains. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Twenty miles to the East of the square was a wall fortress formed from the piling of million-year-old ice rocks. It was high and unreachable, like a wall of the gods. In the world of silver and white, the glistening ice crystal walls were more majestic and imposing, emitting a very dazzling white glow. It seemed that humans of the Spirit Spring stage or lower would most likely be blinded by the white light before reaching the foot of the walls, and unable to recover.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu, as the only human on the battleship, was only clad in a moon white robe, unarmed, and did not have a shred of yuan qi fluctuating from his body. Yet he still caused a huge shock among the Snow Mountain Demon Guards.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Deputy General White Bear Demon, holding the commander military seal, led Ye Qingyu towards the direction of the city gate on foot.</p>
 <p>On this road sentries were posted every few yards, and was heavily guarded.</p>
 <p>The most common guards were also demon experts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The guards all looked at Ye Qingyu, a man who had entered the Snow Ground Demon Court alone, with an extremely puzzled, curious, and strange look.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally, after passing the twenty-third checkpoint, they stood in front of the South gate of the Snow Ground Imperial Court.</p>
 <p>As Ye Qingyu's identity was special, even if the Deputy General White Bear of the Southern Incline army had personally showed him the way and carried the commander military seal that allowed direct access into the Imperial Palace, the demon guards at the gates still deployed six of the top demon elites to follow and monitor them.</p>
 <p>On both sides of the main road in the city, were dozens of lifelike ice statues.</p>
 <p>These statues were all sculptures of demon gods of the Snow Ground Demon Race throughout itsmillions of years of history, casted from Xuan Ice, and were as solid as iron. There were different rune halos of light penetrating out from every demon god statue, dyeing the originally transparent ice rock into a different luster and colours.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Below the statue placed an altar and furnace used to worship the Gods.</p>
 <p>Some demon priests were gathered in front of the altar, praying and chanting sacrificial writings.</p>
 <p>Walking along the statues, an open ice field appeared in front of Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>He had reached the heart of the Snow Ground Demon Court. A number of flying battleships built from the skeletons and corpses of various foreign demons, were shuttling back and forth between the layers of clouds and ice rocks.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Palace Lord Ye, please come with me.” Deputy General White Bear walked over to a sentry post on the South side of the icefield.</p>
 <p>In the sky, a sparkling crystal-like jade white demon snow eagle, slowly descended, steadily landing in front of the post.</p>
 <p>Rumor had it that the Demon God of the Demon Race had rode on a snow eagle back then. Its status was extremely high, but still was the only one allowed to fly into the core area of the Demon God Snow Mountain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu and Deputy General White Bear mounted the snow eagle, rising into the sky, and left with the demon guards.</p>
 <p>After ten minutes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The snow eagle stopped in front of a formation of dark red demon markings.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The twelve small demonic ships docked under the formation slowly rose into the sky and gathered towards the snow eagle.</p>
 <p>On each demonic ship, there were dozens of top demon experts, who were different to the guards at the gate. Although they still took on the form of a demon beast, but their appearance was more towards the human appearance, and each soldier was exuding an incredibly strong demonic aura and power.</p>
 <p>It should be the entrance to the Demon God Palace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked at the palace-like building below the snow eagle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He had arrived at the Demon God Palace.</p>
 <p>The Demon God Palace was equivalent to the imperial court of the Snow Empire, and was the core palace of the Snow Ground Demon Court.</p>
 <p>And the purpose of Ye Qingyu’s trip this time was to see the Demon God and discuss official business with him in the main hall of the Demon God Palace——the Xuan Ice Demon Tower.</p>
 <p>Here, it was much more heavily guarded than before.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After passing the first demon protection formation, the snow eagle began to descend from a height. After advancing for several moments, the demonic aura was more intense, and formations with bizarre markings began to appear in front of them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They passed through a total of eight defence formations.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Like a crane among a flock of chickens, the giant Xuan Ice Demon Tower was sculpted from extremely complete tens of millions of years of ice rock. Its entire body was sparkling, like incomparably translucent glass exuding a luster, which was slightly dark red and seemed like there was blood flowing inside. It was said that the million years old Xuan Ice was not really produced in the land of Heaven Wasteland Domain, but a flying ice rock that broke through the boundary of time and space. The bloodstain was left by the Demon God that the Snow Ground Demon Race worshipped.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stood before the Xuan Ice Demon Tower, inwardly astonished.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He sensed a terrifying power contained in the Xuan Ice——a power that did not belong to Heaven Wasteland Domain—</p>
