 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu was inevitably lamenting when he heard what was said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since he took over the Light Palace, he learned more about the military and state information coming from the various channels of the Snow Empire, and began to understand many things that were not as visible as before. As a result, he also knew more inside stories. When Zhang San was still the head of military supply, although he was considered as having an important role in Youyan Pass, but his evaluation was always bad. He was known to deduct soldiers’ salaries, having secret ties with other residences, giving gifts as bribery, and can be said to be the largest black spot among the entire Youyan Pass. Many people found it strange why the Youyan War God Lu Zhaoge would allow such a person to be in charge of military supply in the first place. It was impossible for Lu Zhaoge to not know about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu was also one who had such thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also because of this that he had a certain view of the Youyan military God Lu Zhaoge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, Ye Qingyu finally understood the role that Zhang San played——If Lu Zhaoge was the War God pillar of the Light formation, then Zhang San was the dark left hand after the light, who fought for the interest of the Youyan military in a foul way when resources degenerated. At that time, the empire’s situation was not good, and the Left Minister deliberately docked the military supply division of Youyan Pass. It was in a state where its income did not cover its expenditure. And Lu Zhaoge's high-principled and open ways many times made it difficult to counter such a trivial but realistic problem. The soldier's salary that Zhang San took was, in fact, something that had saved up and used secretly to support the Youyan army.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he seemed to rely on help from the Left Minister, seemingly colluded with other sects, and was corrupted, but it was also the existence of Zhang San, who had become a buffer for the Youyan army and other forces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang San had volunteered to become a demon. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this world, there was not just black or white.&nbsp;</span></p>

He certainly understood that for the Youyan War God, Zhang San was not only a general who secretly helped maintain the supply for the army, but also his close brother on the battlefield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before his brother’s death, he had failed to make public of his deeds, and he was unable to receive the glory that he should have after his death. This debt, like a huge boulder, heavily pressed onto Lu Zhaoge’s heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a brief silence.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Zhaoge and Liu Yuqing shook their heads one after the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time the incident had happened too suddenly. The military had not received the slightest news so there was no preparation made at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the battle, the high ranking military officers of the military council pavilion had all gathered at the Pass Lord's residence to discuss and explore the causes and clues of the demon unrest. But till now, there still was no good news.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those old monsters possess unbelievable powers. How did they cross the boundary and the defense line without us realizing at all.” [Painting Saint] Liu Yuqing put down the teapot, flicked his flowing sleeves, and a clear sketch of the map of Youyan Pass appeared before everyone. “Now that the world has greatly changed, the yuan qi tide is rapidly surging. The cultivation base of martial arts within Heaven Wasteland Domain is also frantically growing. Under such great changes, the formations and defenses that have been operating around Youyang Pass for decades are unable to keep up. Previously, we have done a lot of remedial work, changed and repaired a lot of formations, but it is still not enough!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, but this time the attack really came too abruptly. Moreover, during the battle we found that the Demon Race experts that attacked this time were not on the previous military watch list. This is too unusual. The empire has always been extremely vigilant against the Snow Ground Demon Court. The experts of the Demon Court above the Bitter Sea boundary will be recorded. And they were also extremely wary towards some particularly tough demon experts, but this time these monsters... seemed to have appeared out of thin air and had never appeared in this world before, so they easily avoided all kinds of detection and appeared in Youyan Pass...” Ye Congyu added, his face crossed with puzzlement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When their plan failed, they calmly retreated, and we could not trace where they went. We have carefully checked the streets and houses a few times already and the checkpoints were heavily guarded, but we still could not find a trace of those demons.” Lu Zhaoge revealed a grave expression, “But I have a feeling that those demon experts are still lurking in the city.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The situation was clearly not great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The presence of such top experts was indeed a great threat to Youyan Pass.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He needed to think of a way to pull out these threats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took a closer look at the topographic map, which had been marked with numerous labels, and formed a plan in mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Ye Qingyu was worried about Liu Suifeng. He stood up and said, “Pass lLrd Lu, take me to see General Liu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Zhaoge nodded when he heard this, “Suifeng is recuperating in my house at the moment, I will take you there.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the back garden of the Pass Lord's residence.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu, Lu Zhaoge, Liu Yuqing, Ye Congyun, and the others came to the door of the hut in the middle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was in this hut that Lu Zhaoge had rested when he was seriously injured a year ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, the person recuperating inside was Liu Suifeng.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knitted his brows in a frown.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a strong demonic aura was definitely left behind by an old demon of at least the peak of the Heaven Ascension boundary. Liu Suifeng must have suffered a lot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without thinking it over too much, he pushed the door open, and right away saw the deathly pale and haggard Liu Suifeng lying on the bed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The burly and resolute Liu Suifeng, who was like an iron tower, had his face twisted with a painful expression, faintly twitching. Although unconscious, he was still clenching his teeth, and beads of cold sweat was trickling down from his forehead. But he did not groan out because of pain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His left arm had been severed from the shoulder, and the upper part was wrapped in black mist, giving off a strong stench.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black mist, like the maggots of the bone, was constantly extracting the yuan qi and life force within Liu Suifeng's body. The bones and flesh close to the broken arm were rotten, and even with Liu Suifeng's Bitter Sea stage cultivation base he unexpectedly was unable to grow out an arm again. &nbsp;</span></p>
