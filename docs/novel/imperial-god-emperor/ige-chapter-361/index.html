 <p>361 - The end of training</p>
 <p>Bao Shinu and the battle technique instructor looked at each other. They did not move to halt such challenges.</p>
 <p>If they were able to raise the battle power of all these young experts, then why should they stop it? For them, this was definitely a beneficial matter. They would definitely receive praise when they reported to the crown prince after the month's deadline. This meant that they had completed their training mission successfully.</p>
 <p>On the arena.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had already defeated six opponents consecutively.</p>
 <p>His entire person was already submerged into a strange Dao rhythm. Every time he struck with his sword, he would follow his heart. No matter whether it was an established sword move, or it was something he made up on the spot, or he would even occasionally use the moves from the [Fiendgod Titled hart]. There was no connection between his actions, he only followed his will.</p>
 <p>The strength of these young experts were perfectly suitable for Ye Qingyu to train his sword.</p>
 <p>They were after all top level experts at the Spirit spring stage or people with half a step into the Bitter Sea stage. They were at a level that was perfectly balanced; while they would give Ye Qingyu huge pressure, they would not make him use his full power to fight. Such a state was perfect for Ye Qingyu to comprehend while battling.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the technique that every young expert used was different and so were their martial styles. It gave Ye Qingyu many different inspirations.</p>
 <p>As time flowed on, Ye Qingyu danced with his sword on the arena. There were young experts that constantly challenged him on the arena of their own initiative. They would fight, then be forced off the arena, then another would come up and challenge, then forced down again. Then more people would come...</p>
 <p>Such a process did not need words.</p>
 <p>This process of consecutive battles continued on for a day and a night.</p>
 <p>For the cultivation of such young experts, such a level of battle could not be counted for much.</p>
 <p>Everytime Ye Qingyu fought with a young expert, the young expert would comprehend something different.</p>
 <p>Even if it was not possible for them to break through their own bottleneck right there, but they would be able to find the direction as to how to break through their bottleneck.</p>
 <p>Because the [War God] possessed a different strange power. After fighting for a short period of time, he would very quickly discover the weakness of the opponent and target such a weak point. It completely suppressed the opponent.</p>
 <p>In a situation where their weaknesses were constantly targeted, they naturally learnt and gained much with the talent of these young experts.</p>
 <p>Ultimately, all of the seventeen young experts, apart from [Shadow] and [Normal Person] had all fought a round with Ye Qingyu. The first thing every one of them did after they were forced off the arena was sit down and meditate. They wanted to comprehend their gains as soon as possible. There were constantly people breaking past their limits.</p>
 <p>What followed after was another day and night of battles.</p>
 <p>After awakening from their comprehension, they would instantly fight to go on to the arena after they saw that [War God] was still standing on the arena. They wanted to challenge him again. They wanted to confirm the results of their comprehension and had high expectations that the [War God] could help them break through yet again.</p>
 <p>For these young experts, such an opportunity was really truly rare.</p>
 <p>Even the best master could not teach them through such a method, to help them find the weakness in their martial path and perfect their martial path.</p>
 <p>For Ye Qingyu, this was a perfect training experience.</p>
 <p>Constantly fighting, unending battles.</p>
 <p>In the process of fighting, his focus gradually shifted away from the battle and his opponent. In his brain, he focused on the description of the Sword Dao in the [Human King Sword Mantra], especially the introduction of the sword mantra to the Sword Dao. Every character was like a flash of insight that would fly about in his mind, then combine again, and then evolve. What followed after was incomprehensibly lengthy theories.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's thoughts had already completely submerged into the [Human King Sword Mantra].</p>
 <p>His body still continued battling instinctively with the young experts on the arena.</p>
 <p>His will and spirit continued on in a state where his consciousness had nearly left his body.</p>
 <p>This entire forty-eight hours of battle was just like an instant for him in his consciousness.</p>
 <p>The tens of thousands of letters in the [Human King Sword Mantra], transformed into light that danced within Ye Qingyu's brain. It reordered itself, as if new mysteries were being born. Insights that were born and died like shooting stars constantly appeared and disappeared. Ye Qingyu madly did his utmost to capture that instant that seemed incomparably far away...</p>
 <p>It was unknown just how long time had passed.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>All the letters and light had disappeared from his brain.</p>
 <p>Quiet, peace and clarity came.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's consciousness once again returned to his body. Everything in his vision became clearer.</p>
 <p>He discover he was standing with his sword.</p>
 <p>There was no longer any opponent on the arena.</p>
 <p>Below the arena, all the young experts were staring at him with shock.</p>
 <p>The sword was in his hands, but it was like the sword was not in his hands.</p>
 <p>The sword was in his hands, but it was like the sword was in his heart.</p>
 <p>With the sword in the hand, there was a great sensation that was born. It was as if he only needed to strike with his sword, and he could cut apart anything in the world.</p>
 <p>“This... this is what the [Human King Sword Mantra] described as the sensation of early success, could it be... I unintentionally interacted with the true essences of the [Human King Sword Mantra]?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu held the [Beheading Wind] great sword in his hand. His heart was both shocked and delighted.</p>
 <p>The long sword faintly moved.</p>
 <p>His entire person was filled with an extremely comfortable feeling. It was as if there was nothing at all that would be able to block his sword. No matter who or what it was in front of him, he could split it into two.</p>
 <p>Looking below the arena.</p>
 <p>One could see a clear sword wound on the clothes of [Avalanche], cutting apart his clothes. There was a faint white scar left on the [Thundering Heaven Hammers]. A trace of blood was on the left side of his chest as well as his right abdomen, that was faintly able to be seen like a red line.</p>
 <p>"Brother [War God], you're strikes are really vicious. If not for the fact that I was able to sense danger and jumped down the arena to admit defeat, your sword might have already taken my life. I would have turned into a corpse split in half on the arena..." Even if [Avalanche] was courageous, his expression was still shaky.</p>
 <p>He was the last person who jumped to the arena to challenge Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Originally, everything was the same as before. [Avalanche] constantly trained and comprehended his own martial path in battle, and Ye Qingyu gave him suitable pressure. It was like the pressure of a mountain or the sea, it was just perfect. But just when he was about to be forced out of the arena, Ye Qingyu's aura suddenly changed. It was not as gentle and as calm as before, and a sharp, piercing sword will that was incomparably sharp descended like ten thousand swords. It was only a casual strike, yet [Avalanche] felt like he was a pig about to be beheaded. He had no way of blocking such a true sword strike.</p>
 <p>At the crucial moment, he immediately jumped down the arena. He also activated the [Thundering Heaven Hammers] to its extreme and blocked such a sword in mid air.</p>
 <p>Even if he did so, he was still hurt.</p>
 <p>There was even a scar left on the [Thundering Heaven Hammers] that was of the Spirit class. It needed the nourishment in his Spirit springs for at least a month or two before it could recover.</p>
 <p>For [Avalanche], such a sword strike was equal to him running between the line of life and death,</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was faintly taken aback, and finally understood the reason.</p>
 <p>When he had succeeded in reaching the early stages of the [Human King Sword Mantra], he could not control its power perfectly and had mistakenly injured the muscular young man.</p>
 <p>He was about to clasp his hands in apology, when [Avalanche] began chuckling. "Congratulations in reaching a whole new level, [War God]. I know that you did not mean to." As he said that, he gave a wink.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The next ten days was the last ten days of the month.</p>
 <p>Apart from training in the nameless breathing technique every day, the large majority of Ye Qingyu's time was spent immersing himself in the [Dragon Fist] as well as the [Human King Sword Mantra]. Such a training process was naturally on the arena. It was constant refinement through fighting different young experts.</p>
 <p>Because Ye Qingyu had helped everyone apart from [Normal Person], everyone, no matter whether they were proud or arrogant or not, would be exceedingly respectful towards Ye Qingyu. Their attitude had grown much more mild. Faintly, the title that Ye Qingyu had, [War God], became true. Not only was his strength the best of the crowd, he also became the leader of the group, with the most authority and charisma.</p>
 <p>In the last three days, there was no way Ye Qingyu could use the [Human King Sword Mantra] to fight with the others.</p>
 <p>Because there was no longer anyone who could even withstand three moves of the [Human King Sword Mantra].</p>
 <p>This had also indirectly proven the words of Dugu Quan. The three great sword mantras were really peerless techniques. It was many times more profound than the secret martial mantras obtained by the other young experts. This made Ye Qingyu faintly feel that he must have been given special treatment?</p>
 <p>As for the [Dragon Fist] mantra, Ye Qingyu had already completely grasped it at a pinnacle level.</p>
 <p>Under the activation of the nameless breathing technique, the [Dragon Fist] in Ye Qingyu's hands were even more powerful than the two instructors. It was only that he did not demonstrate this fact very often. In the entire training camp, including the two main instructors, there was no longer anyone that was Ye Qingyu's opponent. Therefore, Ye Qingyu began to conceal his true strength.</p>
 <p>Of the seventeen other young experts, only [Shadow] ever since he had gotten rid of his psychological shadow, did not challenge Ye Qingyu again.</p>
 <p>The [Normal Person] who was ranked last, had never challenged Ye Qingyu from beginning till end for some reason. But his attitude towards Ye Qingyu was also exceedingly respectful and admiring.</p>
 <p>Today was the last day of the month.</p>
 <p>During the evening, the body refinement instructor Bao Shinu announced that the closed isolation training of a month had finished. That night, they allowed the young experts to leave the building of the military department, and no longer restricted the movements of the group. They only needed to return to the 55th floor of the military building before noon the second day. They would announce and allocate the missions and duties for everyone then.</p>
 <p>Such a result, made Ye Qingyu feel slightly surprised.</p>
 <p>At the very beginning, he had guessed that gathering the eighteen persons here for training and cultivation in isolation, there was a great chance there was a top secret operation of the military, or perhaps some other significant matter. But from the tone of Bao Shinu, it seemed to be just a normal training, and there was not any special training that awaited the eighteen people.</p>
 <p>After releasing the seal, the training of the young experts could be said to have ended.</p>
 <p>Under the proposal of one person, the eighteen people decided to go out and relax. After being cooped up for a month, everyone wanted to go out and breathe some fresh hair. After a month's contact, everyone was already familiar with each other, so no one went alone. The eighteen went as a group.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu knew instantly that the relaxing in their words meant they were about to go to a brothel.</p>
 <p>He originally did not want to go, but the group passionately invited him. He was the person with the greatest authority, so if he did not go, it would spoil the fun of the others. Ultimately, he agreed to go along, and even the most solitary black-robed young man, [Shadow] agreed to accompany them.</p>
 <p>After briefly taking care of their luggage, the crowd left excitedly-----</p>
