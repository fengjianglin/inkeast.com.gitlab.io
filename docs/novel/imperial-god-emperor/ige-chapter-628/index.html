 <p>Chapter 628, Return to Underground Moon Immortal Palace&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Over the next few days, there were a thousand things waiting to be done in Flowing Light City, and renovation works was in full swing.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Roads, buildings, and defensive formations destroyed during the war were all under intensive repair.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>People seemed to have forgotten what exhaustion was, everyone's face was beaming with hope and smiles as they rebuilt their homes.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Some of the shops on the main roads of the city, after days of renovation, had begun to reopen for business. The people who had experienced the war gradually restored the rhythm of their life. The top of the streets and bottom of the lanes were bustling with noise and excitement.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In a place five miles from the east side of the city, a heroes’ memorial garden was built.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The heroes who died bravely in battle to defend Flowing Light City were properly buried here.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Every day, people came here silently to visit the spirits of the heroes.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>As a result of the retreat of the Demon Spider Race, many great demon clans had begun to withdraw. The many territories that were occupied were recovered, and the road from the outside world to Flowing Light City was reopened. As a result, in these few days, there were a large number of refugees, traders and other people pouring into the city. The population of the city rapidly grew.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>At the same time, the Immortal God Emperor Sect also called out to martial sects and experts of Clear River Domain, hoping that the Human Race can unite to overcome the present difficult situation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>It had to be said that the Immortal God Emperor Sect still had the great power to rally supporters in the current Clear River Domain. In just less than a day there were thousands of Jianghu masters coming to Flowing Light City, taking up the important responsibility of protecting Flowing Light City alongside the hundreds of disciples of the Immortal God Emperor Sect. The defense of Flowing Light City was now impregnable.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Everything was moving in the right direction.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The hearts of the citizens of Flowing Light City were getting more and more stable and they were hopeful for their new life.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>With the retreat of the Demon Spider army, there were more and more news of the outside world passed into the city through various channels.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After their crushing defeat in Flowing Light City, the Demon Spider Race’s power had been reduced substantially. As though they were worried about something, they had abandoned the control of many towns, temporarily went into hiding, and for the time being did not continue to invade the territories of the Human Race.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>And the Heaven Desire Demon Sect that had relied on help from the Demon Spider Race in the past, after the retreat of the Demon Spider Race, had went a lot more quiet.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the news of the Hundred Spirits Sect also passed to Ye Qingyu's ears.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>That day when the Heaven Desire Demon Sect took refuge in the Demon Spider Race, borrowed the power of the Demon Race to invade the Hundred Spirits Sect, and frantically attacked the main gate of the Hundred Spirits Sect, but at the critical moment, the master of the Hundred Spirits Sect activated the final protective power. The great formation that was left behind by the ancestors was triggered, and they luckily survived the death of their sect.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>It was only a few days before the retreat of the Demon Spider Race that the Heaven Desire Demon Sect gave up on the siege of Hundred Spirits Sect.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>When the news of the Hundred Spirits Sect came, Ye Qingyu finally really breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>This can be considered as having an explanation for Shen Menghua and the others.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The night of the second day.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In a guest room of the South Facing Inn.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Having returned from drinking, Hu Bugui was boredly leaning against the window, watching the lights of night in a daze.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In front of the window table, Ye Qingyu was drinking a cup of tea, looking out at the increasingly noisy and bustling street, and said thoughtfully, “Now the citizens of Flowing Light City are settled, there are many things to be done, and with the experts of the Immortal God Emperor Sect here, it will no longer be a problem to defend Flowing Light City. There is not much need for us to stay here.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Hu Bugui's swept his gaze over to Ye Qingyu, his bored eyes instantly lit up, exclaiming, “Haha, you mean, we're going back?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Yes. It's been more than a month. Big brother Liu and the others must be anxiously waiting for us in the Underground Moon Immortal Palace. Now that the danger has scattered, we should return and bring them out.” Ye Qingyu nodded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Hu Bugui burst out in a hearty laughter. “Haha, you are right. Liu Shaji and Old Fish and the other guys must be suffocating there. I am also bored, I wanted to leave earlier!”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu faintly smiled. “So, we will set off tomorrow and return to Greater One mountain.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The next morning.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The morning star was still flickering on the horizon, when Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui left South Facing Inn.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Under the hazy morning light, Flowing Light City also maintained a calm and quiet silence. In the distance there were one or two vendors setting up their stalls at the crack of dawn when the formation lights had not entirely disappeared.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Before departure, Ye Qingyu said farewell to Chen Zhengliang and the three elders but also sternly declined the offer of them seeing him off.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu also considered the extraordinariness of the Underground Moon Immortal Palace.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In the Underground Moon Immortal Palace there were the relics of the Thunder and Lightning Emperor Qin Ming. Although he had taken out all the things inside, there was still, after all, the trace of a Martial Emperor. If this trace was found by someone then the major forces of both the Human Race and other races of Clear River Domain will not let go of this opportunity. At that time, most likely, a huge wave will be set off, and also very possibly trigger a war again.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui exchanged a glance, before transforming into streams of light and disappearing into the sky.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>&nbsp;An hour later.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In the midst of the Greater One mountain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Demon clouds rolled across, blood and evil filling the air. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In sight, there was still complete stillness, with no signs of life whatsoever. Fortunately the atmosphere was beginning to stabilize.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The gloomy sky was still filled with waves of evil spirits.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A number of vortex-like residual yuan qi were fluctuating under the dark surging dense clouds and mists.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui, like two sharp swords, sped through the blood- and qi-filled sky at lightning speed. Where they passed, the demon qi and blood mist seemed to have been cut open with a pair of scissors, creating a huge crack that seemed like it would never heal.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Now that he no longer had to worry about being hunted, and that his strength had substantially improved, Ye Qingyu did not need to hide his tracks as well as not have to worry about triggering the numerous random formations around the minefield-like Greater One mountain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In a flash.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The two people discovered something, landing to the ground.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In the midst of the valley.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui stood in front of a grave and paid their respects.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Buried here were the Master of the Hidden Sword Sect and other people, a group of heroes who died in battle for the Human Race.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After paying their respects, they continued ahead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Two hours later.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui came to a stop again in the air.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Below was a huge blood lake, like a giant scarlet jade inlaid in the midst of the Greater One mountain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>That day, Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui encountered a mutant giant tree here and saw the remains of countless experts of different races floating across the water. It was a doomsday scene. But now, the pungent smell of blood and the rotten stench in the air were weaker compared to before. But through the blood-coloured mist, one could still see the Asura hell-like blood lake, which was full of violent blood and evil spirits.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Those evil qi and blood mist, as well as the remnants of yuan qi will most likely only begin to slowly fade after hundreds of years of changes...” Hu Bugui sighed, gazing into the boundless sea-like blood and qi.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Although the yuan qi of Greater One mountain still shrouded the sky like a mass of black clouds, the formation of rune traps and the boundary walls were like an intricately entwined net. However, this time the two people no longer had to worry that the destruction of traps will alarm the other forces. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Let's go.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked in the direction of a pool a few miles away. Suddenly, his figure flashed into a ball of lightning and darted toward the layers upon layers of boundary net.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Underground Moon Immortal Palace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Dim and quiet.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>When the raging underground river passed through here, the water was like a mirror.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The stone room after the corridor was relatively small, but the area outside the corridor was very large. Liu Shaji and the other people had stayed here for a period of time. Everyday they basically went into a meditative state and began cultivation. Here the spiritual qi was abundant, which greatly aided cultivation. For any martial artist it was a very rare opportunity.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Of course, except for Old Fish.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Huh? Haha, it seems that the two small fishes are about to go ashore...” Sitting cross-legged and propping his chin on the palm of his hand, Hu Bugui, who was fishing in the underground river, suddenly with a flash of his eyes, as though he had sensed something, stared at the lake with a grin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Beside him, constantly throwing small stones to deliberately disturb Old Fish fishing, Yu Xiaoxing’s eyes also lit up.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Could it be...? Cousin, they're back?” she exclaimed.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Before her voice faded away.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Hua!</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Two figures suddenly drilled out from the glistening mirror-like water surface.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>They were Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Cousin!” With one glance, Xing’er immediately jumped up and fluttered towards Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was unable to evade, a soft and warm body threw itself in his arms.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Almost at the same time, the other people in the stone room and sitting by the lake meditating also felt movement, one after another they ended their cultivation and rushed over.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Is everybody all right?” Ye Qingyu ran his eyes across, noticing that the state of the people were all pretty good. He finally was able to heave a sigh of relief.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Oh, you two are finally willing to come back!” &nbsp;Liu Shaji smilingly looked at the two people who were in good condition, and right away patted Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui on the shoulder in relief.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Nan Tieyi also revealed a glad smile. Seeing that the two people had returned safely, he finally could relax.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>It was evident that during this period of time, they were all worried about Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The master and disciples of the Hundred Spirits Sect were also amongst the crowd.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Gongzi Ye, Gongzi Hu, it's so nice to see you come back safely...”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Yes, yes, you've been away for one month without the slightest message, we were very worried.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Shen Menghua and Liu Ruxin one after the other came to the front, their beautiful eyes flowing with a warm brilliance. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Ai, didn't know I’m also included, haha, to be missed by the fairies of the Hundred Spirits Sect, haha, I benefited from the association with someone!” Hu Bugui teasingly cast a glance at Ye Qingyu, a strange smile curving his lips.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Shen Menghua gracefully responded with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Liu Ruxin lowered her head with a shy smile, like her mind was read.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Ai, brat, you have been gone for a month, I did not expect you to progress again... Also the growth is not small, it seems you had a fortuitous encounter again!” Old Fish unhurriedly put away his fishing equipment, wandering over from the other side of the lake, and studied Ye Qingyu from head to toe with his cross-eyes. He also could not help having a glimmer of surprise emerging in his eyes——</p>
