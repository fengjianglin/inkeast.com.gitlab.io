Who knew that Ye Qingyu could easily destroy a doppelganger that had just completed being refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the matter that he most hated in the past year.&nbsp;</span></p>

Moreover, it possessed great potential for ascension, and was one of the great weapons that he had painstaking prepared, but also something that he had to rely on in the future. Back then it was because of the limits of the power of laws of Heaven Wasteland Domain that he had to release a doppelganger, but who would have known that his carelessness allowed Ye Qingyu to destroy his doppelganger. All his efforts and expectations were turned into ashes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was worse was that the matter had led to a sharp drop in the prestige and reputation of Ao Tianzun. His position was shaken to the point that he was replaced by the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, even if he was incredibly unwilling, he had a status much lower than the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect. On the surface, he also had no choice but to respect her opinion.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about it, his teeth began to itch with hatred.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don't let your emotions affect your decision. Don’t be angered by brother Ye Qingyu and take his bait. Elder Qiu had fallen victim to the enemy because of his carelessness. We cannot repeat the same mistake. Our plan today is to kill him and take his treasures, and not to compare martial arts. Don’t fight alone, let's attack together. Activate the formation and torture brother Ye Qingyu to death. A long delay may instead cause trouble.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She spoke softly, addressing him as ‘brother Ye Qingyu’, but her intention was ruthless, like the venom of a snake or scorpion. It maked one shudder with fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hint of anger emerged on Ao Tianzun's face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He obviously wanted to personally deal with Ye Qingyu, but the way that the Saintess said it seemed as though she did not trust him. However, considering that the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect was now the most favoured in the camp, he should not be impulsive. With this thought, he shrugged, did not utter a word, and took two steps back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smile curved on the lips of the Saintess as she gently waved her hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom! Boom!&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These artillerymen were all martial arts experts who were able to control the giant cannon to a very precise level and absolutely would not hurt other people. The frightening flames from the giant cannon transformed into a giant killing net in the Void, almost blocking all of the possible escape routes of Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were constantly new sealing formations being set up, slicing through space, and compressing the room that Ye Qingyu could manoeuvre around. Silver formations flickered, repeatedly sealing the space around Ye Qingyu, and in the blink of an eye, the space ten meters around his body had turned into a solidified state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was evident that the masters of the Blood Taster Sect worked like an army. The coordination between the artillery group and formation group were neat and orderly, and extremely methodical. It was as if they were an advanced machine. Everyone’s movements were not in the slightest disharmonious. The thousands of people were just like a single person; the movements were uniform and the rhythm of the huge energy cannons shooting out destructing rays were the same. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even for Ye Qingyu, in such a space, he also could not rely on martial arts and footwork to avoid the frequent net-like bombardments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not hesitate to directly operate the secret arts of the one hundred and eight &nbsp;ancient characters to summon out the [Cloud Top Cauldron], and suspended it above his head. In the mouth of the cauldron there were bright yellow ribbons that floated out and protected him in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the bombardments were isolated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon seeing this scene, a smile spread to the eyes of the Saintess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She seemed to have long anticipated the scene, but was also waiting for this scene to appear. In particular, when she saw the giant bronze cauldron, her eyes lit up, flashing a hint of admiration. She carefully studied the [Cloud Top Cauldron], as though appreciating the world's most perfect divine object. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I was really pressed for time that day and I didn't have the chance to fully appreciate brother Ye Qingyu's cauldron, but I was already aware of its extraordinariness. Seeing it again today, it is indeed extraordinary. Among its simple and unadorned appearance it contained the Dao rhythm and Emperor qi. It is most likely a life weapon of an ancient Emperor before he achieved the Dao.” The Saintess could not help but praise and then sighed regretfully, “Brother Ye Qingyu's luck is indeed astonishing to be able to obtain such a treasure in Heaven Wasteland Domain. Sigh, but I also have to thank brother Ye Qingyu for giving such a treasure to me. brother Ye Qingyu, please be rest assured that after your death, this &nbsp;little sister will be kind to this cauldron and unleash its true power, and not let it be covered in dust.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her tone of voice was incredibly sincere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the words coming from her mouth were simply too shameless. From her expression and attitude, it was as though killing and snatching someone else's treasure were inevitable and right, and instead Ye Qingyu would profit from this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing under the [Cloud Top Cauldron], Ye Qingyu was expressionless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had experienced this mentality of the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect before, so he didn't care much about it, nor would he be angry. What made him slightly surprised was the fact that the Saintess had determined the [Cloud Top Cauldron] to be an unfinished imperial weapon, and that it was most likely to be a life weapon of an ancient Emperor before he achieved the Dao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But upon second thought, it seemed that everything maked sense. The power of the [Cloud Top Cauldron] was invincible and could even withstand against the power of the killing intent in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss. This degree of strength was comparable to that of an imperial weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Saintess had a mind which was as venomous as a snake or scorpion, but her insight and judgment were absolutely first class, that even Ye Qingyu felt inferior. If she had said so, then it was most likely true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And hearing these words from the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect, the few other Saint level experts also revealed a look of surprise, and then looked at the [Cloud Top Cauldron] again, their eyes twinkling with greed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cauldron like that, even if it was only an unfinished imperial weapon, was already too immeasurable, let alone that this was a life weapon of an ancient Emperor. No matter what, once something involved an ancient Emperor, it would be a treasure that would shock many super forces.&nbsp;</span></p>

The fact that he reached his present cultivation level must be because of the secrets contained in the cauldron. With this thought, he felt his heart beginning to heat up.</span></p>

Even if the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect could see through this treasure, she should not have mentioned it. Once exposed, this treasure would certainly arouse the interest and competition of everyone, and given the current status of the Saintess in the camp, she also may not be able to get it with certainty. Why would she actually dare to say it out loud in front of so many people?&nbsp;</span></p>

At his foot, because of the protection of a large formation, there were a number of potholes but it did not shatter. In less than ten meters of space, the exterior parts of the [Cloud Top Cauldron] were thoroughly melted away. It did not contain the essence of Heaven and earth, nor the slightest light; it was almost a pure terrifying ‘nothingness’.</span></p>

This formation and the huge cannons, even if it were to continuously attack for ten days and ten nights, they still won't exhaust brother Ye Qingyu.” The Saintess smiled, everything obviously within her expectations. Looking at Ye Qingyu, she then continued, “Brother Ye Qingyu, do you think what I said is right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu did not withdraw the bronze cauldron, nor did he respond. &nbsp;</span></p>

There is also the [Giant Cannon Camp] and [Formation Camp] of the Blood Taster Sect, as well as the blood supply of one thousand peak Heaven Ascension experts, and then the power of six Saint experts had activated the formation. Furthermore, they are accompanied by the [Red Lotus Hellfire].” The Saintess smiled, looking at Ye Qingyu with a hint of ridicule. “This method, brother Ye Qingyu, how long do you think I need to exhaust you to death and obtain this cauldron? The cauldron is invincible, but brother Ye Qingyu, your inner yuan will be used up, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>

As this evil woman had said, they would exhaust him no matter what, and under the situation that he cannot replenish himself, he could at most withstand for up to one month. If he were to replenish his yuan qi using all the divine liquid essence and rare treasures he had on him, he would still deplete all of his resources within ten years.&nbsp;</span></p>

The Heaven Wasteland Domain would be completely transformed into ruins and become a miserable colony.</span></p>

In her eyes, the one thousand elites of the Blood Taster Sect were just blood supply. She could sacrifice them as she liked and regarded them as worthless as dirt.&nbsp;</span></p>

If there were a better way to make you voluntarily hand over the treasure, why would I spend so much time and manpower. Brother Ye Qingyu, I think you understand what I mean, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
