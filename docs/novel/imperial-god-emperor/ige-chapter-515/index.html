Geniuses appeared everywhere, and there were five young Princes that had managed to activate the bloodline power of the ancestors. The one that they had managed to kill because they had taken advantage of an opportunity was the most prodigious out of all of them. It was someone that was recognized to be the next successor to the leader of the Demon Spider Race.&nbsp;</span></p>

So it was the disciples of the Greater One Sect. Haha, no wonder you are the disciples of that Greater One hypocrite, the person that is known as the most shameless and despicable in all of Clear River Domain. Ambushing and attacking from behind are things you guys have already became masters at. Even my arrogant brother was killed by this, hahaha."&nbsp;</span></p>

It can't be you right?" The young man laughingly looked at Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; His nose twitched and sniffed: "En, that's right, your body has the smell of the curse from Black Five. Haha, in such a short time, I really managed to discover two such interesting matters. My brother was ambushed by a bunch of trash, but Black Five is an old bastard who has lived for thousands of years. To similarly be crippled by such a piece of trash? Hahaha, this really is too... too laughable. Can it be that all the trash in this world is about to rise up?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a Greater One Sect disciple that, because of his fear and the pressure that the round faced Demon Spider Prince gave off, could not help but lose his self-control. He had wetted his clothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing this, the round faced Demon Spider Prince was also taken aback.&nbsp;</span></p>

He began chuckling, laughing so much that his stomach hurt. He hugged his stomach while standing on that slender branch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Haha, I... nearly have to kneel down... because of such weird people like you... hahaha, my dear brother, if he knew... that he had died in the hands of people like you..." The round faced Demon Spider Prince gasped for breath from laughing too much, "He would definitely be so angry that he would come back to life... haha, didn't he think himself a peerless hero. Haha, for a hero to die in the hands of worms such as these... laughable, this is really too funny."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He had the tone of someone rejoicing in others misfortune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Master, a long night will have many nightmares. First kill those damn worms, and take vengeance for elder young master." The black mist flickered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; A mighty and muscular figure walked out from the black mist and stepped through the air. He took step by step toward the round faced Prince of the Demon Spider Race and paid his respects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; There was another one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu's heart quivered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This muscular figure was an old man with white hair and a white beard. His black robe was patterned white, and he had thickly grown facial hair. His hair had a strange somewhat yellow pattern on it. Just by looking at him, Ye Qingyu thought back to the gigantic spider's leg that had passed by through the Central Domain Gate, because it had a similar pattern on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; And in the moment that Ye Qingyu realized this, Ye Qingyu also perceived that this muscular old man's right leg, did not seem too agile. He seemed to have a limp about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "This should be that great spider that had it's leg broken."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu finally understood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This muscular old man was definitely that Black Five mentioned in the words of that round faced Prince of the Demon Spider Race. He was the spider that had intruded into Heaven Wasteland Domain that day, and was struck by an arrow of Ye Qingyu. Because he feared the power of the [Supreme Ice Flame], he ultimately cut off one of his legs. He was one of the enforcers of the Demon Spider Race.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "What did you say? There will be many nightmares in a long night?" That round faced Prince slapped his own leg in mad laughter. "For such a group of trash, you fear they will cause me a nightmare? It's been so hard to get out, I'll slowly play and let them die one by one.“</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "I worry that, the reinforcements from the Greater One Sect will quickly arrive," Black Five lowered his head and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hohoho, if you didn't mention it, I might have forgotten. That's right, if the reinforcements from the Greater One Sect come, what should we do?" The round faced Prince suddenly stopped madly laughing, rubbing his brows. After a brief pause, he became overjoyed again. "I've thought of a solution."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "What solution has young master thought of?" Black Five helplessly followed along with the conversation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He deeply knew the temperament of this mad young master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; At this time, he must go according to his will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "We can wait until the reinforcements of the Greater One Sect arrive, then kill them all together. Hahaha, what do you think, isn't my plan amazing," the round faced Prince said excitedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Black Five stood there for a while with a frown, not saying anything more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The five young bloodline Princes of the Demon Spider Race were all experts that had outstanding talent. After waking the bloodline of their ancestors, they had endless abilities. But every one of them was arrogant and unbridled, every one of them more conceited than the last. They did not care about anything at all, daring to do anything and everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; If it were not like so, the eldest Prince would not have challenged that matured blood vine and caused both parties to suffer a loss. Then the trash of the Greater One Sect would not have had an opportunity to take advantage of his plight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; They had chased these Greater One Sect disciples for more than a month, and they had finally found them. Who would have thought that the second young master's personality would be like so. If they really waited till the reinforcements of the Greater One Sect arrived, then the matter would become troublesome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's right, Black Five, those two young people," The round faced Prince pointed at Ye Qingyu and Yu Xiaoxing. "This little pair of lovers shouldn't be citizens of the Clear River Domain. On the body of this handsome little husband, he has your marking. He should be the person who cut off one of your eight legs. You should quickly take vengeance, I'll first spectate. Haha, perhaps your seven other legs would also be chopped off by this little man."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In the tone of this fellow, there was an instigating tone as well as delighting in someone's misfortune. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Thank you second young master for allowing this." Black Five nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This old fellow casually grabbed in the air. The black demonic qi in his hand was like a rope of spider web that curled and tangled to form a net. It headed directly towards Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Black Five had long sensed the marking on Ye Qingyu's body. But previously, because the round faced Demon Spider Prince had not said anything, he had not acted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Opposite.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; At this time---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In the skies, there was suddenly a pale green light that descended. Like it was a rain of light, it completely enveloped Ye Qingyu as well as the nine Greater One Sect disciples including Lin Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; They could see the skinny tall youth, Huang Xin with the Greater One Lantern in his hands. It suddenly increased in brightness greatly. It intersected with the green light of rain, and a strange and extremely vast energy was born like so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu could feel his body lightening.</span></p>

The scenery changed. In an instant, he could not help as he along with Yu Xiaoxing and the other Greater One Sect disciples were as if they broke apart the boundaries of time and space. Like they had ascended into becoming immortals, they departed from where they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; When they reacted, they were already hundreds of miles away.</span></p>

A jade green splendour and radiance completely enwrapped the surroundings, shining its bright light on everyone. There was a soothingness like their fleshly bodies were being bathed in a Spirit spring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Next to this mysterious green ancient lantern, there were tens of mighty figures standing in the air.</span></p>

He was elegant, his long sleeve wrapping in the air. There was an indescribable confidence about him, as if he was a benevolent old immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Next to this old man, there were three young heroic young men that stood there proudly.</span></p>

Every one of them had a rampant and incomparable yuan qi fluctuation on them, deep as an abyss. It was as if they were six divine mountains that could not be moved.</span></p>
