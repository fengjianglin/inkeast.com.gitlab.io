 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Chongsheng's family had come to seek revenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was now so powerful that he would know what was going on after he sent out his consciousness power. Ye Chongsheng's family had been cowed into submission by the elderly Quasi-emperor after the battle at the Four Stars Sect and promised that they would not create trouble, so he had let down his guard. After all, they were a lost tribe of the Human Race and he had already secretly looked into Ye Chongsheng's family and decided to leave them alone when he saw that they were not corrupted by the dark forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It looks like this family has already gone over to the dark side."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he left the [Guanlan Mountain Manor].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the Human Race headquarters at the Alliance of Domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A man with an aquiline nose who looked very young sat flagrantly on the seat of the spokesperson and a malicious smile spread across his face as he looked at the six huge steel stakes placed in the main hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The continuous split-splat sound of liquid dripping could be heard throughout the quiet hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the sound of blood as it dripped into a vat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Six figures were tied to those six steel stakes and jagged steel hooks lined with formations pieced through their shoulder blades and poked through their chests. There was a mysterious formation on these steel hooks and there were also lines of blood grooves on these hooks that tormented the bodies of those being tortured and released the blood within their bodies one droplet at a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Split-splat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Split-splat, split-splat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood fell one droplet at a time into a vat that was designed to collect blood and the blood inside the vat was already more than one meter deep. It gleamed brightly and emitted a fragrant aura - this was a unique characteristic of the blood of martial experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who were tied to the stakes all held high positions within the Human Race headquarters. They were the four leaders of the White-robed Divine Guards - Tang Chong, Lin Yutang, Fang Bule and Jin Zhiyi, as well as the person who was supposed to be in charge of the headquarters, Spokesperson Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Dragon Turtle Demon was also tied to a stake along with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Tsk tsk, you've already been hanging there for ten days and nights and even I shudder at the thought of how painful this must be for all of you. Imagine how surprised I was when none of you uttered a sound. You must all have wills of steel," the hook-nosed young man looked at the steel stakes with admiration and laughed coldly. "Ha ha, you must all be iron-willed. What a pity that you chose to listen to Ye Qingyu who has brought disaster upon you all. It has been so many days but he has still not dared to show up to rescue you. I guess you'll just have to watch yourselves bleed to death one droplet at a time."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not one of the six people tied to the stakes replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were all martial experts and their flesh and blood could grow again, so they wouldn't even bat an eyelid even if they experienced the pain of their bodies being crushed, but this [Blood Flow Stake] was rumored to be specially tailored to punish fiendgods in the ancient era and it had the ability of magnifying one's pain by a hundred or even a thousand-fold. There was no way for those being tortured at this stake to resist the pain and they could only watch and listen helplessly as their blood bled out. This was designed to make the victim feel extreme pain both physically and mentally and even fiendgods would cry out in pain when they were tortured in this manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All six of them were extremely frail by this point in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were all martial experts with strong blood and qi and the blood that flowed within them was as abundant as a river, so they obviously would not die from blood loss after bleeding for ten days and nights. However, other than the excruciating pain they were in, each drop of blood they lost was also a loss of their cultivation energy. The big vat at the bottom of the stakes was a storage item and could contain rivers and oceans within it. The pool of blood seemed to be only a meter deep but in fact, it was already as large as a lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All six experts were extremely weak after ten days and nights of torture, but no one begged for mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were more than a hundred experts in [Yellow Sand Hundred Battle Golden Armor] who surrounded the stakes and it was clear from their aura that they were all extremely powerful. They looked exactly the same as the soldiers who protected Ye Chongsheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Fang Bule, I heard that you had once clashed with Ye Qingyu and that he doesn't like you," the hook-nosed young man laughed derisively as he looked at Fang Bule who was tied to the fourth stake. "Ye Qingyu is famous for being ruthless, so now that you've offended him, you would face death sooner or later. I can't believe that you still refuse to surrender. Are you foolish or just blindly loyal?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Bule did not respond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His head was bowed as he did his best to bear with the excruciating pain. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't stop his body from trembling slightly as the corrosive force from the formation hooks ate at his body. He struggled to adjust his breathing so that he could not lose his composure nor scream in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why, do you really think that Ye Qingyu would forget your past disagreements and let you hold great responsibilities?" the hook-nosed young man continued scornfully, "Moron, you don't even know that you've been manipulated, so you deserve death."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha ha ha…" Fang Bule laughed softly and his laughter was full of contempt as he said, "I don't know whether Ye Qingyu would let me off the hook, neither do I know if he would entrust me with great responsibility. I don't even know whether he would rescue me, but what I do know is that no self-respecting human would surrender to someone like you. I, Fang Bule might not be a famous person with outstanding power, but at least I still have a spine that is thankfully very tough…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Humph, moron," the hook-nosed young man crossed his arms around his chest and laughed coldly, "If this isn't blind loyalty, then what do you call this? Even if Ye Qingyu finds out that you've died here, he wouldn't do anything about it. Don't forget that your hands are stained with the blood of the White-robed Divine Guards, so your spiritual tablet will not be placed in the hall of heroes after your death."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha ha ha ha…." Fang Bule laughed loudly. "Moron? You're the real moron here. You might be a Quasi-emperor, but you don't even know the simplest principle in this world… Ha ha ha, you don't know anything."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hook-nosed young man's face darkened and he said with an icy smile, "Oh, why don't you tell me what is it that I don't know?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The point that you are completely missing is that I've chosen not to surrender not because of Ye Qingyu, but because I am a true leader of the White-robed Divine Guards and my appointment has been approved by the Alliance of Domains in a fair and just manner. I have always acted in accordance with the rules of the Human Race headquarters and even when I attacked the divine guards under Lin Yutang's command, I was only obeying my orders… I've never acted selfishly but you, you're just a martial artist who might be extremely powerful, but you lack the righteous spirit, so how dare you try to get me, a lawfully appointed leader of the White-robed Divine Guards, to surrender to you? Ha ha, you're not worthy!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a powerful and lofty speech.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yutang's and Tang Chong's expressions both changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had always held a grudge against Fang Bule and this was especially so for Lin Yutang because Fang Bule had once gone after his trusted men and thus, he had always given him the cold shoulder. However, after Fang Bule's powerful speech, Lin Yutang suddenly realized that perhaps he had not truly understood his comrade after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Well, very well, you should carry your bones and this lofty position that you're so proud of down to hell with you," the hook-nosed young man was furious to be rebuffed and he raised his hand to point at Fang Bule's stake. Then, a strange lightning bolt shot out from his finger and into the formation steel hook, activating some kind of formation that caused the steel hook to flash with electric currents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Bule's body immediately twitched violently and sweat dripped profusely from his body. He was clearly in immense pain, but he did not utter a single sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hook-nosed young man's gaze swept past all six of them and the killing intent was clear in his eyes. There was also some impatience in his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ye Qingyu, it has already been ten days and nights. If you refuse to show yourself, then don't blame me if I start going on a killing rampage," he said menacingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had only tortured these people over the past few days in hopes that he could force Ye Qingyu to show himself. Then, he would be able to avenge the death of his son, Ye Chongsheng. However, this tactic didn't seem to be working and if he was not able to force Ye Qingyu to show up, then these six people were of no value to him and were better off dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he contemplated his options, there was a series of footsteps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A white-haired elderly expert scurried into the hall and bowed, "Master, we've already made all the arrangements and have also gotten the support of seven large conglomerates who are willing to support our operation. We've also finished assembling the Golden Armored Army, so they would be able to attack Heaven Wasteland Domain at any time. It wouldn't be an issue to attack Snow Capital in a matter of two hours and capturing their empress won't be a problem at all."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hook-nosed young man nodded with satisfaction and said, "Good, well done. He he, Ye Qingyu launched a punitive expedition against the Four Stars Sect and his strength stunned the world, so this time, I'll exterminate the Heaven Wasteland Empire and force the empress who he has always worked to protect to be my servant. After I've done that, no one in this world would dare to cross me. Ha ha ha!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elderly servant hesitated for a moment and said, "Master, the Dragon Human Race is their ally so they'd probably come to their aid if we launch an attack on them. We must be on our guard since Xu Wuya's Dragon Teeth Army is also incredibly powerful."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Dragon Human Race? Ha ha, I'll personally deliver a warning myself. If they refuse to heed my warning, I guess we'll just have to exterminate them too," the hook-nosed young man said with a cold laugh, his voice brimming with confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He paused for a moment before he asked, "Are there any further developments over at that old man's end?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The elderly Quasi-emperor has been trapped in the [Great Array of Heavenly Punishment] that you laid out and has barely managed to protect his grandson and he won't be able to last much longer. Sir, your deductions were very accurate and that old man's strength has indeed deteriorated greatly…" the elderly servant said with a sinister laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha ha, who else would be able to stop me in this world?" the hook-nosed young man laughed heartily. "I really have Ye Qingyu to thank for this since he killed two Quasi-emperors during his punitive expedition of the Four Stars Sect. Now, there are no longer any Quasi-emperors left and since I have merged with an Emperor weapon, I'd be able to rule over the world. Ha ha ha!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Congratulations, master."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Master, you are great and mighty and no man is your match!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elderly servant and the [Yellow Sand Hundred Battle Golden Armor] soldiers cheered loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha ha, once I find Ye Qingyu and kill him, then this world will completely belong to me," the hook-nosed young man said excitedly. He was not afraid of Ye Qingyu since he had his own methods in dealing with him. He was only worried that Ye Qingyu would ignore the plights of his friends and go into hiding. Then, it would be tough trying to search for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment——</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is that so? Will it belong to you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A voice suddenly thundered from outside the hall and this voice was full of rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hmm? Who are you?" the hook-nosed young man said in surprise. How could he have failed to realize that an intruder had approached the main hall?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spokesperson Li, Great Dragon Turtle Demon and the rest brightened up when they heard the voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He's here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He has finally arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
