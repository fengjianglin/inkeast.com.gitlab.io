 <p>Chapter 561, The value of the [Cloud Top Cauldron]&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The aura that erupted from the Moon Wheel was like a raging wave. Even if separated by the boundary walls of the Storm Platform, the people on the surrounding floating peaks could all feel the terror of the power, which did not belong to Chen Shaohua. Therefore, on each floating peak, this scene stunned everyone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“This is... the power of the Immortal Step boundary!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Among the Moon Wheel, there was unexpectedly a strong aura of an Immortal Step expert... this is not a Moon Wheelthat Chen Shaohua activated.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Yes, it's obvious... it is the aura of the peak master of Great Hua Peak! He sealed his strength in the moon's wheel, to fight a junior!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“The peak master of Great Hua Peakhad entered the Immortal Step for several hundreds of years, possessing unfathomable strength, but as an elder, he unexpectedly used this method to...”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“The high and mighty Greater One Sect used such means to deal with a junior, it is very contemptible!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After all, not everyone are dogs of Greater One Sect, some of the experts also could not help whispering and criticizing upon seeing the scene.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>And immediately someone reminded in a low voice——</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Be quiet, don’t let the people of Greater One Sect hear you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“What? Can I not speak the truth, is Greater One Sect going to cover over everything?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Don’t be too impulsive.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On a floating peak, several people quarreled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>At this time, an elder who had been keeping order on this floating peak, gave a slight smile, “Everyone, let’s watch the battle on the Storm Platform. Manage your own mouth. Do not talk, or who knows what kind of disaster will fall on your body... Haha, in this world, there are people dying everyday!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>His tone was heavy with threat.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Those quarrelling people were after all people of little sects. Although they were furious, but they dared not make a sound.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In recent years, Greater One Sect had been too powerful; many experts and sects felt indignant but dared not voice their objections.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>And such a scene also occurred on many other of the other floating peaks at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Countless martial artists were forced to keep their resentment to themselves.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the Hundred Spirits Sect’s floating peak.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Greater One Sect used such low tactics! Tian Huang, he--” Hundred Spirits Sect’s eldest senior sister Shen Menghua subconsciously jumped up and blurted out upon seeing the scene on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In her mind she despised the Greater One Sect. Her beautiful eyes were filled with worries.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Senior sister...” Liu Ruxin hurriedly motioned her to sit down.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After all, at this moment, there were Greater One Sect elders on this floating peak. They were said to attend to guest’s needs but were in fact monitoring them.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Shen Menghua still wanted to say something.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Menghua, sit down.” &nbsp;An elder of the Hundred Spirits Sect interrupted her.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Shen Menghua’s complexion repeatedly changed, and finally let out a low inward sigh, silently shaking her head.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On a small floating peak.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“His mother, this Greater One Sect really is despicable, they unexpectedly used such ruthless tactics. Brother Tian Huang may not be able to withstand this!” Hu Bugui leapt up when he saw the force that broke out from the Moon Wheel.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>There was a very obscure movement of yuan qi from his body.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On his side, Liu Shaji, Nan Tieyi and the others were darkened with anger.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>What Greater One Sect had done really was too much. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>They all had made preparations to rescue him. Once Tian Huang really was... even if they broke the rules of the Storm Platform, they will still help out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the Storm Platform.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was on guard as though he was facing a formidable enemy.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“I can't even move!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He frowned slightly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>This body of qi of the Moon Wheel was too strong, and adding to this was triggered by the power of the Immortal Step boundary. If he was hit, he would be seriously injured, if not dead!&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>His mind made a momentary judgment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Of course, Ye Qingyu was not afraid.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Because he still had a lot of cards that he had not played.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Opposite.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua had completely abandoned all of his self-esteem, completely fallen from grace.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He gave an evil grin, ugly and hideous, like a demon.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Do you feel the aura of death? Haha, you see, I said before, you are dead today.” Chen Shaohua smiled grimly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He imitated the imposing manner of Ye Qingyu when he threw out his fist before, letting the moon slowly close in on Ye Qingyu, letting the power of the Moon Wheel &nbsp;slowly crush Ye Qingyu in order to let Ye Qingyu feel more torture and fear before he was killed. He also wanted to see on Ye Qingyu’s face, the crazy struggle and madness he displayed when he was almost dying.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>But Chen Shaohua was disappointed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu only just slightly frowned.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Do I need to use the flash formation in the bronze book? No, that is one of the cards to rescue Xing'er, If I used it now how do I rescue Xing'er later.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu rejected the idea himself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the opposite side, the Moon Wheel was already rolling over to him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Just as Ye Qingyu was deeply constrained, and was ready to use another card, an unexpected change appeared.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Among his dantian was a warm current slowly surfacing, like a burning flame.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He was taken aback for a moment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The next moment, the [Cloud Top Cauldron] that was situated silently in his dantian was suddenly vibrating, automatically operating itself in the absence of Ye Qingyu's activation.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu vaguely felt that the [Cloud Top Cauldron] was shaking like it wanted to be free from his control, as though it was a living object, releasing an unprecedented aura. The next moment, it indeed turned into a stream of light, escaping from his dantian, buzzing and vibrating. In the beginning it was only a fist-like size, flashing with strange rune markings. The originally dark yellow furnace walls were also releasing a bright golden brilliance, before turning into a large three-legged cauldron that needed five or six people to encircle it fully, automatically suspending above Ye Qingyu's head.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The cauldron hummed like the laws of heaven and earth were circulating.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>There was a dark yellow mist spilling out from the [Cloud Top Cauldron], like a braid of weeping willow, but also like a crystal curtain. The mysterious yellow light mist was just enough to envelop Ye Qingyu within.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Such a change had completely baffled Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>And then——</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Boom!&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A power that was at the Immortal Step stage activated, the Moon Wheel striking the mysterious dark yellow light mist above.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The mysterious yellow light mist rippled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>As gentle as the spring breeze brushing the pond surface. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>But that terrifying Moon Wheel acted like it hit the Demon God’s sky canopy. It uttered a deafening roar as an explosion of power burst out, like the wrath of Heaven. The space on the platform was torn by this explosive force, creating numerous space cracks and a majestic yuan qi power poured out, forming blades of yuan qi that engulfed the whole platform to bury Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The whole Storm Platform was quaking violently, as if it would collapse in the next moment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Below the Storm Platform.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On each of the large floating peaks.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“What is that?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“What weapon did Tian Huang summon? It seems like a... a cauldron?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“That cauldron, can block the Moon Wheel?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The crowds on the floating peaks broke into a clamour.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The experts on the small and large floating peaks were all staring in the direction of the Storm Platform, their expressions were each different to the other. Someone wore a complacent face, some faces were crossed with worries and some were furious.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>At this time Old Fish seemed unworried, sitting with one leg over the other and humming a tune.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Hu Bugui, Nan Tieyi and the others possessed profound strength, and originally they were about to rescue Ye Qingyu when they saw the appearance of the [Cloud Top Cauldron] on the Storm Platform, causing them to hesitate for a moment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On Greater One Sect’s floating peak.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Greater One Spiritual Master kept an indifferent complexion, as if everything happening on the platform had nothing to do with him.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Behind him the peak master of Great Hua Peak knitted his brows in a slight frown, killing intent flitting across his eyes.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The influential figures of the Nangong family, the Sky Demon Palace, and the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect also seriously fixed their eyes on the Storm Platform. The battle on the Storm Platform had ignited their interest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the Storm Platform.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The blade of yuan qi gradually dissipated.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The terrifying power was also gradually eliminated.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Smoke dispersed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Dust settled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Under the gazes of innumerable eyes, a figure safely landed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>It was Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>His body was without the slightest scar, his aura was calm and relaxed.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Above his head was a three foot ancient cauldron quietly floating.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The veil-like light curtain hanging down from the cauldron was fluttering along with the gentle breeze, and the thread-like lines on the light curtain were winding like a picture scroll.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Not a single hair was injured.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The [Cloud Top Cauldron]n had completely withstood the power of the Moon Wheel.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Vaguely, the crowds on the floating peaks burst into quiet cheers.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Opposite.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“This... No way....How can it be?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua exclaimed, face twisted with disbelief, like he had just seen a ghost.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The strength of the Moon Wheel was so powerful, even Immortal Step experts weremost likely unable to withstand an attack, how could they not be shocked...&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>This cauldron... is it a divine weapon?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>No, no, even a divine weapon needs an Immortal Step expert to activate for it to withstand the fatal blow of the Moon Wheel, but Tian Huang had not reached the Immortal Step boundary, but by relying on this cauldron alone he had successfully blocked the power of the Moon Wheel.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Is this cauldron, is it a... sacred weapon?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua stared dumbfoundedly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>His gaze rested on the ancient cauldron above Ye Qingyu. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>This cauldron looked like an ancient and simple cauldron, about one meter high and wide, with a thin layer of gold stained with brilliance. In the sun it looked as though it was made from pure gold, and its whole body depicted various ancient beasts and patterns, vivid and lifelike, as though they were living creatures. The flowing cloud patterns on the ancient cauldron’s three legs were drawing the outline of a previously never-seen-before rune. A mist-like light curtain hung around the cauldron like a veil, exuding a moonlight-like halo that shrouded Ye Qingyu within.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Under the shrouding of the mysterious yellow light of the giant cauldron, Ye Qingyu’s black hair fluttered, his clothes billowed about, looking like a demon god overlooking the mortals.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Chen Shaohua almost lost the ability to think.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>At this time, Ye Qingyu was pleasantly surprised.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He never thought that the [Cloud Top Cauldron] would have such a change, actively protecting the master.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>All along, Ye Qingyu had treated the copper cauldron as an instrument, a tool, and had never had expanded its function in the direction of an attack and defense weapon, and had never thought that it possessed such tremendous power.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A moment of good luck made Ye Qingyu realize that before, he may have underestimated the [Cloud Top Cauldron].</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After all, it was a divine item that had occupied a similar area as the ancient bronze book, [Fiendgod Titled Chart] in his dantian. It was most likely that even it’s background would far exceed Ye Qingyu’s imagination.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Back then, when Liu Yuanchang obtained this treasure, he merely treated it as an ordinary pill furnace, and Ye Qingyu had also once stated that it was a waste for the [Cloud Top Cauldron] to fall into the hands of Liu Yuanchang. Who would have thought that once he got the [Cloud Top Cauldron], he also did not notice the preciousness of the copper cauldron and had been neglecting it all along. What's the difference between him and Liu Yuanchang?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu criticized himself inwardly——</p>
 <p><br></p>
