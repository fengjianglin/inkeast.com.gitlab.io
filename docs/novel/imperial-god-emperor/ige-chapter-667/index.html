 <p>Chapter 667, New threats and changes&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The remaining two demons shared a glance, revealing a hint of a stubborn cold smile.</p>
 <p>Although they were deterred by the terrifying power of Ye Qingyu, they were, after all, old monsters who had lived for a long time, and very soon they calmed down.</p>
 <p>The scholarly demon ran his eyes over the crowd, and finally his eyes fell on Ye Qingyu, as a ferocious look burst forth, “The human who does not know the immensity of the heaven and earth, so what if you kill us. I tell you, sooner or later, the countless experts of the Demon Race would awaken. Our Sky Demon ancestors will lead the tens of thousands of us demon citizens to capture Youyan Pass, take over the Snow Empire imperial court and completely wipe out the Human Race of Heaven Wasteland Domain!”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu faced the blade-like ferocious gaze with a look of indifference. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>He gave a nonchalant smile, “Is that right? In that case... go to hell.”</p>
 <p>Before his voice had faded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu waved his finger in an extremely casual motion, as if he was just gently brushing some fluttering leaves in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Ugh...”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A hurried but suddenly halted cry sounded from the mouth of the scholarly demon.</p>
 <p>The scholar who was still cursing the Human Race moments before, was frozen stiffly by a cold air that began to spread out from his body, losing all his life force and turning into a lifelike ice sculpture.</p>
 <p>Bang!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The ice sculpture split into two, before collapsing into a pile of ice shards, scattering all over the floor.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The remaining demon expert with side burns could not hide the despair in his eyes. The youngster before him was incredibly powerful, simply too terrifying. Before they had launched an attack on the people of Youyan Pass, they had already carefully investigated the power of its human experts, and even the strongest Lu Zhaoge was no match for them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But, how did that happen?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>How could someone with near abnormal strength appear in the Human Race?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Why wasn't there any information about him found in their previous investigations?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You're the only one left... the same question, now, can you answer it?” Ye Qingyu was as calm as before.</p>
 <p>As though he had not killed two Heaven Ascension realm demon experts, but two weak chickens.</p>
 <p>The only demon expert left glared resentfully at Ye Qingyu, and then his body suddenly began quivering very strangely, and his eyes were clouded with a layer of odd dark purple colour.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“He wants to blow himself up!” With one glance, Lu Zhaoge noticed the bizarre movements and action of the Demon Race expert, and was just about to act.</p>
 <p>But the next moment, he saw that the demon expert’s face was contorted with extreme pain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ao!” The remaining demon expert howled angrily.</p>
 <p>As he initiated his self-destruction, that terrifying icy power that blocked the meridians in his body, penetrated into the body, like tens of thousands of steel needles, drilling into his bone marrow, and like hundreds of ants nibbling away at his bone. Unable to bear the pain, he instantly sealed his demon yuan, and was unable to self-destruct.</p>
 <p>“From the situation, it seems I won't get any answer...”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu gently shook his head. He stretched out his palm, turned it over, and pressed down above the demon expert’s head who was unable to move a single step.</p>
 <p>A strange consciousness power seeped out from the palm of his hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The demon expert's face that was twisted with pain, all of a sudden stiffened, immediately realizing something and issued an ear-piercing howl at once.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ah... you... it's... ah!” The demon expert's facial features twisted, seemingly in extreme pain, but no matter what was still unable to free himself of Ye Qingyu's palm. His hands tightly clasped to the ground, slashing out a few deep scars across the hard black slate.</p>
 <p>An immensely powerful consciousness power was as though it was currently reeling silk from cocoons in his mind. His memory was like a fine cobweb, his entire memory including the depths was forcibly pulled up, surging toward Ye Qingyu's palm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu used the most terrifying means to forcibly search and retrieve the memory of the demon clan expert.</p>
 <p>After a few moments.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu slowly withdrew his palm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The demon expert spouted foam from his mouth and, losing all his power, he finally slumped on the ground, paralyzed. The pain of being stripped of his memories was torturing his brain.</p>
 <p>His eyes were hopelessly fixed on the ice crystals that had not yet melted around him, and for a moment, was somewhat envious of his two demon companions who had already taken their last breath. At least they had died right away, without having to suffer this kind of torturing death.</p>
 <p>And on the other side.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Lu Zhaoge and the others who probably also had guessed what Ye Qingyu's intention was, were waiting for Ye Qingyu's discovery.</p>
 <p>The consecutive killing of two great demon experts, and almost crippling the third one, such a thunderous method simply maked one shudder with fear. But in the eyes of Lu Zhaoge and the others, it was expected. After all, these three demon experts had killed too many masters of the Youyan army; their hands had been stained with the blood of the Human Race.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“These few, indeed are the Ancient Demons that had been lying dormant in the territory of the Blood Race Demon Court...” Ye Qingyu looked at Lu Zhaoge and the others, eyes flashing with a hint of solemnity.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He retold the memory that he had learned from the demon expert’s mind.</p>
 <p>The mysteries of the matter was related to the appearance of the Central Domain Gate. Because one year ago when the Domain Gate was opened, the world began to change greatly. The strength that could be supported within the domain was greatly enhanced, and the Ancient Demons, who had been sleeping in the Snow Ground Demon Court for a long, long time, felt the change and woke up in succession.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before they went into deep sleep, their cultivation base and strength had already reached the peak that this world could bear. The limits of the laws of heaven and earth of Heaven Wasteland Domain meant they could no longer move forward one step. With their life about to end, and a lack of better option, they had to retreat and seal their body. Through this, they were able to temporary fake their death, and escape the relentless erosion of time, hoping for the day when the heaven and earth tide would change, and they could wake up again, and break through the boundary.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And they did successfully make it.</p>
 <p>The day of the enhancement of the heaven and earth tide of Heaven Wasteland Domain had finally arrived, and they had finally awakened.</p>
 <p>They used demonic techniques to allow their strength to rapidly increase in the shortest possible time, and obtained more life force.</p>
 <p>However, the ambitions of these reborn Ancient Demons also, with the growth of their strength and life force, increased with each passing day and were once again flourishing as before.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before they slept and sealed themselves, they were all well-known important figures of the chaotic era of sects and not one of them was not a fierce character. Every one of them was ambitious, but the ruthlessness of life meant that they had to cease all activities and lie low. Now that they had gained strength and life, they wanted to make a comeback, not only to destroy the suppression of the Demon Courts and the rule of the Snow Empire of the Human Race, but they also intended to restore Heaven Wasteland Domain to the chaotic era of sects hundreds of years ago.</p>
 <p>That was the time that they were familiar with and adapted to.</p>
 <p>“The sneak attack of the Ancient Demon experts on Youyan Pass was not just a spur of the moment, but they were ordered by an even more powerful Ancient Demon monster. They call that person the old ancestor of the Sky demons.” Ye Qingyu cast a thoughtful look at the demon expert whose demonic aura was weakening, and gently shook his head, “But unfortunately, the old ancestor of the Sky demon is very mysterious, there isn’t information on the appearance of that Ancient Demon monster in his mind. It seems that they were ordered to carry out the operation this time.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone had an abrupt change of expression upon hearing these words. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>These three demon experts were already very frightening existences, able to enter and leave Youyan Pass undetected. If Ye Qingyu had not helped out, there was no one that could do anything to them. But they were surprisingly under the orders of someone else, this... from this it was obvious of how terrifying that the Sky demon old ancestor was.</p>
 <p>“It seems that this is just a signal before the storm...”</p>
 <p>Lu Zhaoge glanced at Liu Suifeng who was breathing steadily but had not yet awakened, gently sighing.</p>
 <p>The outstanding commander, in the eyes of countless Youyan Pass soldiers, was a god-like idol existence. It was the first time he felt the uncertainty of the road ahead and a sense of crisis. But unexpectedly as the situation was about to be resolved there suddenly came out a group of awakened Ancient Demons.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At that moment, strange things happened——&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Rumble!</p>
 <p>There was a sudden quake at the back courtyard of the Pass Lord's residence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Dong!</p>
 <p>Before everyone had reacted, the city's category one alarm sounded all of a sudden.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>WuWuWu!</p>
 <p>The warning alarm signals rang in all four directions of the Pass, and even the bugle horns on patrol airships in the city were issuing an incredibly shrill noise.</p>
 <p>In a short moment, the alarm signals reverberated across the city.</p>
 <p>The shrill and ear-piercing warning sound, in an instant, drowned out all the voices and sounds of the bitter cold border city.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Countless people in the city looked into the sky in horror.</p>
 <p>For the first time, the highest defense and alert signals had sounded in Youyan Pass. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What's going on?” Ye Qingyu exclaimed.</p>
 <p>He had served in Youyan Pass before, and naturally understood the various defensive measures within the Pass, and was also very clear of the meaning of the various military bugles of the Youyan army. But during his time in Youyan Pass he had not heard the signal of such a terrifying warning. Even back then when Lu Zhaoge and the others encountered Song Xiaojun or Yan Buhui’s attack, the highest warnings were not issued at that time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It's a military bugle sound... it's... have the demons invaded?” Ye Congyun’s face went pale.</p>
 <p>“How could it be so fast...” [Painting Saint] Liu Yuqing exclaimed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Lu Zhaoge also had a look of astonishment across his face.</p>
 <p>He could not be clearer about such a signal; it was a signal issued only when the Youyan Pass was in danger.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meanwhile.</p>
 <p>On the tables screens, floor, and chairs in the hut, like cobwebs, the formation markings instantly spread all over the place, flashing a golden light, and constantly emitting a burst of dark red halo.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Rumble!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A deafening loud noise kept ringing from the city.</p>
 <p>A vast and majestic aura gushed out from every corner of Youyan Pass.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A number of light beams of golden formations cut through the clouds and pierced into the sky.</p>
 <p>The sky of Youyan Pass.</p>
 <p>All over the area, the sparkling and colourful light patterns weaved together, forming a dome-like protective rune formation, shrouding the entire Youyan Pass within.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It's the highest protection formation...” Liu Yuqing stated.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The formations within the boundary of Youyan Pass were connected with the boundary of the outer area, and when the protection boundary encountered an indefensible attack, the formation of the Youyan Pass would automatically initiate the highest defense.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It's a demonic aura! Take a look at the North city gate.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s face grew serious, his figure flashed, and a silver beam of light shot up. He was the first to fly in the direction of the city wall.</p>
 <p>Rolling and bubbling forth from different directions, like tentacles, tyrannical demonic aura rapidly invaded the Youyan Pass.</p>
 <p>“Reporting to Pass Lord, the Southern Incline army of the Snow Ground Demon Court is invading our territory!” The commander of the city wall defense battalion darted over, the shock on his face still had not yet receded. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Congyun, take him to the dungeon, and then join us at the city walls.” Lu Zhaoge turned into a stream of golden light, disappearing where he stood.</p>
 <p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Several different colours of smoke signals were fired from the hand of [Painting Saint] Liu Yuqing, before he turned into a stream of light and sped away in the direction of the city wall——&nbsp;</p>
