 <p>252 - Selling Pills</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could see from far away that there was a green-clothed young man pacing back and forth anxiously. He presumed he was the family of a patient coming to the Hundred Herb Hall to treat their illness and was currently waiting for the doctor’s diagnosis, so he did not pay too much attention to such a thing.</p>
 <p>Only when he approached did he see Shopkeeper Sui following behind this green-clothed man like a tail, explaining something with a smile.</p>
 <p>Oh, so Shopkeeper Sui was busy.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu thought about it, then decided not to go over and directly greet Shopkeeper Sui. He entered the main hall and decided to wait a while till they were finished with their business.</p>
 <p>Who knew that at this time, the eyes of Shopkeeper Sui suddenly brightened, as if he had just seen his own close family. Running over with large strides, his voice was shaking, "You… you've finally… you are the Great Pill Master who left the pill here for sale?"</p>
 <p>Great Pill Master?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu, of course, would not regard himself as any sort of Great Pill Master.</p>
 <p>But whether he had left a pill here for sale… En, he really did do that.</p>
 <p>But the expression on Shopkeeper Sui made Ye Qingyu somewhat confused. Could it be that after he had left the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet], another man had come dressed exactly like him, with white clothes covering his true face and also left a pill at the store to sale?</p>
 <p>"[Mysterious Heaven Pellet]… was the pill that you left behind for us to sell, right?"</p>
 <p>Shopkeeper Sui was so moved that he was about to cry.</p>
 <p>His hesitant and conflicted expression was completely like an immature kid waiting for his crush to give a reply to his confession.</p>
 <p>In reality, because he did not see Ye Qingyu' true face that day due to the fact it was covered by a white layer of fabric, he could not be completely sure about Ye Qingyu’s identity.</p>
 <p>At this time, he was extremely cautious.</p>
 <p>He could not make such a big mistake in front of Lin Qingyi.</p>
 <p>"[Mysterious Heaven Pellet]?" Ye Qingyu nodded his head. "It was I who left it for sale."</p>
 <p>"You've finally arrived." Shopkeeper Sui's expression was so contorted that he was about to cry.</p>
 <p>Before he could say anything else, the Lin Qingyi beside him could already bear it no longer and rushed over. "It's really you? You created the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet]? How many is left? Can you still refine it? I…"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked at Shopkeeper Sui in confusion.</p>
 <p>"Master Lin, this… Great Master. This is not the place to discuss such matters. Please follow me upstairs, we will discuss everything in detail. " Shopkeeper Sui looked towards the crowd. There were many people in the main hall and he was worried that they would overhear the information or news about the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet] and as a result leak such information. He did not dare take any risks. Making an effort to make it seem he had not lost his composure, he lowered his voice as he made this proposal.</p>
 <p>"Oh, that's right, Come up and discuss, come up and discuss…" Lin Qingyi also reacted.</p>
 <p>In these few days, the lost sleep he had over this incident had completely exceeded the total length of lost sleep in the last 10 years.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded his head.</p>
 <p>He could already faintly guess what this was about.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Tens of breaths later.</p>
 <p>"What? You really can continue to create it?”</p>
 <p>Lin Qingyi jumped up in excitement, joyously gripping his hands. He had infinite expectations as he looked at Ye Qingyu, "This is too fantastic. Could… could I ask whether this pill formula is something you personally created? Is there anyone else that knows of this pill formula?"</p>
 <p>In the quiet room.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu silently sat on a chair next to the fire basin.</p>
 <p>The large, expansive white clothing and hat covered his entire person. Under the dim lighting, he seemed to be a white-coloured and silent snowball, emitting traces of cold air. It caused someone to have no way of discerning what he was thinking at all.</p>
 <p>When they reached upstairs, the discussions finally begun.</p>
 <p>Although Ye Qingyu did not reveal his true face, but he did not conceal the fact that he was the creator of the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet].</p>
 <p>Such mystifying actions were naturally used to ensure that Shopkeeper Sui and Lin Qingyi had no way of discovering his true identity.</p>
 <p>Hearing Lin Qingyi's question, Ye Qingyu's voice answered. After change, his voice became like the grating of metal. It sounded out from under his hooded clothing, "No one else knows."</p>
 <p>"Phew…" Lin Qingyi let out a breath of relief. He was currently in a state of strange of excitement. Biting his teeth, he ignored the taboo of the Pill Master profession, and asked probingly, "Then… I wonder if you would be willing to sell the Pill Formula?”</p>
 <p>Before he had even finished.</p>
 <p>An extremely cold aura began emanating from beneath the snow white hooded clothing.</p>
 <p>Everyone in the room could not help but shiver.</p>
 <p>Enquiring after a pil formula, was one of the most taboo actions between Pill Masters.</p>
 <p>Lin Qingyi also quivered in his heart, knowing he had invoked the rage of the opposing party. He rushed to explain, "Please don't misunderstand. I don't have any malicious intentions. I swear by the reputation of Hundred Herb Hall, I absolutely do not possess any desire that I should not. It's only…"</p>
 <p>Without waiting for him to finish, a single word came out from under the snow white hooding garment----</p>
 <p>"Sell."</p>
 <p>This word was like a flame, that immediately eliminated the cold in the chamber.</p>
 <p>Lin Qingyi's heart began wildly thudding, "Truly?"</p>
 <p>The creases of the white hooded garment did not make the slightest of movement, as if it was a ghost.</p>
 <p>"I apologize, I should not have doubted you." Lin Qingyi was somewhat hesitant, then instantly understood. This mysterious Pill Master had a cold personality and used his words as sparingly as gold. But since he said he was willing to sell the Pill Formula, then everything was possible. Deeply breathing in, " I wonder what sort of price you were looking for. Rest assured, as long as it is within reasonable boundaries, we Hundred Herb Hall will definitely be able withstand the cost."</p>
 <p>"Fifty pounds of Origin crystal."</p>
 <p>An outstretched hand with all five fingers extended stretched out from the wide sleeve of the hooded garment.</p>
 <p>Ice crystals floated around his fingers, making it seem like he was a snow man, causing any of his features to be unable to be seen.</p>
 <p>"What? Fifty pounds of Origin crystal, you've gone completely mad," a disciple began crying out in disbelief. "You're like a lion opening its mouth, asking for too much. Do you know what fifty pounds of Origin crystal represents? You're deliberately making matters difficult. Why don't you go rob someone."</p>
 <p>Before he had even finished.</p>
 <p>Pak!</p>
 <p>Lin Qingyi directly gave him a backhanded slap, coldly saying, "Get out."</p>
 <p>The disciple was stunned, cradling his face, "Master, I…"</p>
 <p>"Get out. I don't want to say this a second time." The incomparable aura and status that Lin Qingyi displayed in this instant was something that truly belonged to the mannerisms of a genius of the Pill way. He swept his gaze to his other two students, waving his hand, "You two also get out. In front of this Master, none of you have any status whatsoever."</p>
 <p>The three disciples did not dare tarry, rushing to respectfully depart.</p>
 <p>"Please don't take offence, those three disciples are still inexperienced." Lin Qingyi clasped his hands in apology.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not say anything.</p>
 <p>"But fifty pounds of Origin crystals is really too valuable. Even us Hundred Herb Hall, we can't withdraw such an amount at a moments notice… Is it possible for you to ask for something else?" Lin Qingyi began to haggle probingly.</p>
 <p>Without any warning, Ye Qingyu suddenly stood up.</p>
 <p>After making the connection between this series of events, Ye Qingyu could already be sure that the value of the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet] far exceeded his previous imagination.</p>
 <p>It was only because he wanted to rapidly increase his strength that he chose to sell the Pill Formula.</p>
 <p>After all, the effects of the Origin crystal was greater than the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet].</p>
 <p>The true value of the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet] lay in the fact that it was replicable. In the hands of a single person, it was not worth that much. But if some large faction or perhaps a country got hold of it, then it would become crucially important. This was a pill with strategic class value.</p>
 <p>So even if he decided to sell the Pill Formula, he was not willing to be ripped off like a fool.</p>
 <p>And even if he sold the Pill Formula, he had already memorized the contents of the Pill Formula in his consciousness. He could still continue to refine such pills, so selling the formula posed little loss to him.</p>
 <p>The snow white hood fluttered, and he reached out to pull down the hood even more. Directly, he said, "You are a Pill Master, so you should know the value of the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet]. Fifty pounds of Origin crystal, it cannot even be one gram less. If you can't produce such an amount right now, then you can first place a deposit. Ten pounds of Origin crystal, with the rest to come in the future. I have limited time. I'm not willing to waste any time on such pointless haggling.”</p>
 <p>As he finished his words, he turned his head towards the direction of Shopkeeper Sui. "The two [Mysterious Heaven Pellets] that I left here for sale, have they been sold?"</p>
 <p>Shopkeeper Sui replied automatically, "Not yet… oh, but us Hundred Herb Hall is willing to procure them at the original price, we can immediately give payment."</p>
 <p>"That is best." Ye Qingyu nodded his head, his voice still the strange grating metallic noise. "Give me the money. As for the Pill Formula, you can discuss leisurely amongst yourselves and find someone who can make decisions. I will return in three days."</p>
 <p>As he finished, he went straight to the door, exiting from the chamber. Three steps later, his figure disappeared from where he originally was.</p>
 <p>Fast!</p>
 <p>Lin Qingyi eyes shot up from seeing such a scene.</p>
 <p>The power of this mysterious person was very high.</p>
 <p>"Master Lin, what should we do?" Shopkeeper Sui asked, somewhat anxiously.</p>
 <p>Lin Qingyi lowered his head in thought. "Since he is willing to sell the Pill Formula, this is the best scenario. I guess that he must be lacking money, that's why he chose to sell the Pill Formula. Otherwise, solely on the basis of the Pill Formula, it is enough for him to become one of the most famous Pill Masters within Snow Empire… En, but to refer to our original discussion, fifty pounds of Origin crystal…" He was still shocked by this figure, saying, "Let's further discuss this matter when my master arrives."</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>All was calm and peace over the next three days.</p>
 <p>Youyan Pass was still somewhat chaotic.</p>
 <p>There were countless people inquiring into the state of Lu Zhaoge's injuries, but there was still no news whatsoever that came from the Pass Lord's residence. Lu Zhaoge still did not appear in front of everyone. A myriad of rumours began to spread concerning the news that Lu Zhaoge's injuries could not be healed. It was unknown where these rumours originated, but it began spreading about through Youyan Pass.</p>
 <p>Contrary to expectations, the actions of the large sects became more restrained.</p>
 <p>It was said that the people who were arrested that day within the new recruit training camp were still imprisoned within the prison of the Vanguard.</p>
 <p>The young leader of the Dragon Tiger sect, the [Tiger Saint], Zhao Shanhe had personally came to the Vanguard camp to ask for the release of those people, but was met with closed doors. He could not see the commander of the Vanguard, the [Butcher of Youyan], Liu Siufeng at all. He was directly ejected out from the main camp of the Vanguard…</p>
 <p>The Vanguard had never demonstrated such a hard stance before.</p>
 <p>And as for the demon killing parade on the streets, for some unknown reason, there were signs that it was halting in these few days. Two entire days had already passed before any traces of the demon race could be found in Youyan Pass. It was as if the spies of the demon race hidden in the city had been completely exterminated.</p>
 <p>And in the steel cage that hung above the [Beheading Demon Platform], the head of a wolf demon that was killed two days ago still hung there.</p>
 <p>As for Ye Qingyu, in these three days, he continued to remain in isolation.</p>
 <p>Refining pills, ingesting it, cultivating, increasing his cultivation…</p>
 <p>Then he continued to refine pills.</p>
 <p>He repeated this process over and over again.</p>
 <p>The process of refining the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet], could also be counted as a type of training. As time flowed by, Ye Qingyu's control and handling over the [Heaven Earth Copper Cauldron] and the [Sole Will of the Heaven Earth Copper Cauldron] became increasingly proficient. He was able to sense the intricacies within, and hence his speed in refining the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet] became faster and faster.</p>
