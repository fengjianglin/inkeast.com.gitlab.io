Ren Puyang must really have high hopes for you." Old Fish's face broke into a smile and his eyes twinkled mischievously as he toyed with the token in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu could not help nodding.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ren Puyang first fought for the opportunity for Ye Qingyu to enter the [Infinite Arsenal], then gifted the Heaven Wasteland Domain with the Black Gold Battle Puppets. He also guessed that Ren Puyang must have played a part in carving out a space for the Heaven Wasteland Domain's representative station as well. Coupled with the fact that the respected leader of the Divine Guard, Xiao Lin, had been by his side these past few days… All of that was enough to show that Ren Puyang genuinely supported Ye Qingyu and truly had high hopes for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He would remember the kindness that Ren Puyang had shown him.</span></p>

Ximen Yeshui complained after he scanned the contents of the token.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu ignored him.</span></p>

No one else within the envoy mission other than Ye Qingyu knew his true prowess, but from the respect that War God Ye Qingyu had always shown him, and from the few times he displayed his extraordinary moves, it was obvious that he was definitely no weakling and was probably a formidable character. No one else in the entire envoy mission dared to underestimate Old Fish, but Ximen Yeshui thought that he was extraordinarily powerful and remained unconvinced of Old Fish's prowess. He always compared himself to Old Fish in every aspect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Respect the elderly and care for the young. You little punk, don't you know how to respect your elders?" Old Fish glanced at Ximen Yeshui and smugly stroked his long beard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a reason why Ye Qingyu had divided the Puppets in such a way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These Battle Puppets would constantly need to be controlled by one's consciousness power during the journey back to the Heaven Wasteland Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Fish had sustained Dao injuries and, although his strength seemed formidable, it was weak in reality. Nonetheless, his consciousness power was the strongest in the entire envoy mission and thus, controlling eighteen Black-Gold Puppets would be nothing to him. He could even easily bring eighty puppets with him back to the Heaven Wasteland Domain. As for Wen Wan, Ximen Yeshui, Yan Buhui, and the Empress, their consciousness power had all been severely depleted during the Chaotic Windstorm. They seemed as though they were in good condition, but they would still need time to cultivate before they returned to their peak condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, these people were worthy of his trust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu was very comfortable leaving the Black Gold Puppets with them and knew that they would be able to bring out the true abilities of these puppets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for himself… He did not plan on taking any puppets with him. With his current strength, if he ran into an enemy he could not handle, even if he unleashed these Battle Puppets, the effect would be negligible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They continued to discuss other miscellaneous matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The meeting only ended late at night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the meeting ended, Ye Qingyu went to the western courtyard again to visit Great Dragon Turtle Demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Great Dragon Turtle Demon's condition had deteriorated significantly. His complexion was sallow and his breathing was shallow. He was now bedridden and lay quietly in bed. Under the care of Little Dragon Turtle Zhong Xuan, he could still speak with some effort, but he no longer had any appetite and returned to his true form of a green-shelled Dragon Turtle that was as big as a stone bed. His original form should be as big as a mountain given his long lifespan, but now that his life force was completely exhausted, his true form had shrunken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nonetheless, he remained in good spirits and his eyes still twinkled. He looked very contented and managed to exchange a few words with Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Dragon Turtle Zhong Xuan wiped the tears from her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As usual, Ye Qingyu checked on Great Dragon Turtle Demon's condition and discovered that the inner core of his demonic qi only had a glow that was as tiny as a firefly. It flashed faintly as though it could be easily extinguished by a gust of wind. He knew that once this tiny glow was completely extinguished, Great Dragon Turtle Demon would then reach the end of his lifespan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this tiny glow was weak but resilient. Upon careful observation, one could sense a wisp of Phoenix nirvana aura lingering in its core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wisp of nirvana aura was far too weak to change the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu also started to feel powerless to change the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at Little Dragon Turtle Zhong Xuan, who stared hopefully at him as though he was her savior as she wiped the tears from her eyes, and he thought of those who had died during the grading process—Jin Tuodao, Shi Potian, Qu Hanshan, and the rest. He was then filled with grief. These people were heroes of the Heaven Wasteland Domain but had their lives tragically cut short. He had brought them out of the Heaven Wasteland Domain and it would be far too cruel if he could not save them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu could not bring himself to face Little Dragon Turtle Zhong Xuan's hopeful gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He heaved a secret sigh and started to say something, when for some reason, those words strangely came back to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The Great Dao is as vast as the blue sky. Yet, I find myself unable to leave!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As though he had gained sudden enlightenment, those words appeared in his mind and shone as brightly as the sun, instantly driving all the doubt and confusion away. Ye Qingyu grasped a faint shred of enlightenment. This shred of enlightenment flashed as brightly as a fiery spark and he could dimly sense it overlapping with the faint glow in the core of Great Dragon Turtle Demon's demonic qi. The entire process was extremely mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"...One's destiny is in the hands of heaven, one's path is trodden on the ground, and one's heart lies within oneself. The foundation is beyond the universe… Therefore, to be inducted into the Great Dao, the foundation lies in one's heart ."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There seemed to be a solemn voice chanting these words in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The words that this voice was chanting were from the final technique he read in the [Infinite Arsenal]—the [Great Dao Induction to Rebirth Scripture].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The voice was like a divine decree, as though a Quasi-emperor had spoken. It was mysterious and profound and each word seemed to contain a law of the Great Dao and resounded in his mind as thunderous as heavenly lightning or the wrath of the deities. Its voice surged and echoed like a big bell and his mind was so shaken that it turned completely white. He could not sense the existence of any organism and it was so quiet that he did not know where he was. There seemed to be a thick fog of chaos in front of him, as though every single organism had been obliterated, as though the universe was first created, as though the universe had returned to its very foundation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was not sure how long it was before the whiteness in front of him slowly parted. The purer and lighter particles floated upward, while the murkier and heavier particles fell toward the ground. A ray of light appeared between the cracks and entered his line of sight. Then, this light exploded and it was so dazzling that Ye Qingyu could not open his eyes.</span></p>

It seemed as though someone was calling out to him. He struggled hard and finally freed himself from this strange state to open his eyes. He could dimly see some figures and when his vision cleared, he saw an anxious and child-like face staring at him.</span></p>

He suddenly recalled what he had been through, but at the same time, he sensed that something was wrong, so he asked, "What happened? I was..."</span></p>

From the bright rays of light that flooded the room, he discovered to his surprise that it was daytime.</span></p>

He is alright." Old Fish pinched his cheeks and pulled at his hair as he breathed out a sigh of relief. "That was extremely odd. You were just meditating here when you almost Dao-dissolved into oblivion. What the heck was that? We were so scared that we did not sleep the entire night..."</span></p>

A life force that looked weak but had boundless energy slowly rose from his withered figure, and low and even popping noises could be heard from his body. These sounds were very bizarre and sounded like a divine drum. Its rhythm and pace were grand and majestic and it contained Dao sounds that caused the surrounding space to quiver each time it sounded!</span></p>

I must have read too many manuals of the martial way in the [Infinite Arsenal] and earlier, I comprehended something and slipped into a state of sudden enlightenment… Don't worry, we should first check on Great Dragon Turtle Demon."</span></p>

As for the rest, you may leave. That includes you, Zhong Xuan. Your grandfather's life isn't in danger anymore but he needs time to recover. You mustn't disturb him."</span></p>
