Outside the empire, the Demon Race as well as the Brute Race was the strongest powers. No matter whether it was the Right Minister, or the White Mountain Black Water Brute Race, these were entities that could not be provoked within Heaven Wasteland Domain. But right now, there was someone who offended these two major forces at the same time?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As a result, there were people who specially investigated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As such, there were people who began enquiring through various channels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The result of such investigations and enquiries was enough to make one utterly shaken.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As for the important people who knew of these news faster and more in detail than the rest, their reactions were nearly the same as these people. But they were able to digest the shock in their hearts faster than them. After their initial shock of hearing such news, they all began taking action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The gates of the Right Minister's residence opened greatly. The people who departed greatly increased, flying airships as well as battle beasts constantly departing. Those who had military power all returned to the residence one after the other. This was especially so for the experts of the [Thirteen Cold-Blooded Eagles], they all flew towards the Right Minister's residence at the first instance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Right Minister’s residence originally had a chilliness that was present within it. But on this day, it became increasingly terrifying. The people walking past the residence was able to sense the fearful sinister killing intent emanating from the residence, quickly sped up their footsteps and departed rapidly. It was as if the walls of the Right Minister's residence would collapse at any instant, and there would be a bloodthirsty existence jumping out and finding someone to eliminate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; At the same time, another piece of explosive news began to be spread about.</span></p>

But right now, for Wei Hua's head to be publicly hung, this was tantamount to ripping the face of the Right Minister’s residence apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ever since the Right Minister had come into power five years ago. he had also been provoked by such a brutal method that was like contempt many times. The people that had once provoked him included many nobles and powerful families. Most of the families looked down upon the official that came from a civil background, and hoped to make this lowly commoner depart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But after five years, the people, as well as their close friends and families who had done such a thing, paid a price they regretted greatly. Either their entire family was killed, or they would receive torture that made them wished for death.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Even Ouyang Buping and Dugu Quan, after they heard such news, was so shocked they could not even utter word. it was said that Ouyang Buping had broken a jade cup, and Dugu Quan, because he was too shocked, his hand had quivered and he had wasted a cauldron of normal pills that was about to be produced.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "That little brat... he really has gone crazy. After being silent, he is about to pierce a hole through the very heavens." Dugu Quan found Ouyang Buping at the first instance, and began discussing, "What do we do. We have already bounded ourselves together with this little bastard. This time, the matter has really gotten too big.“</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Right Minister's residence should not be incited like so. What is wrong with that little kid? Why must he kill Wei Hua? Just how did Wei Hua offend him?" Ouyang Buping pressed his lips together. At this time, the Divine Doctor that was known as the person with the best mental cultivation suddenly let out a swear word, "Motherfucker, we have gotten onto a pirate ship. The person we've sworn as brothers too, even if we get utterly crushed, we must still recognize him. Right now, it's no use speaking of such, why don't we think of a method for the little bastard to take care of the present situation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Dugu Quan also had a grimace on his face, as he grumbled, "Previously, I felt that this little kid could cause trouble, but I did not imagine he would dare to cause such an incident... but going back on topic, perhaps this matter is something that we've overthought, and are worrying over nothing. Old man, do you think that brother Ye is the type of person that would not care about others when he goes mad?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ouyang Buping, upon hearing this, was slightly taken aback, then thought about it carefully. With surprise, "Old fox, you are right. This time, it was brother Ye who let out the first strike right? Doesn’t this mean that he has the self-confidence to believe in the fact that he can withstand the thunderous means of vengeance of the Right Minster?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Dugu Quan laughed. "Ever since the year of that person, there has never been anyone who is able to enter into the [Light Palace]. Who knows just what is contained within the [Light Palace]. The methods and abilities of that person are absolutely something we will not be able to guess at. It's possible that he left something behind that is able to act against the Right Minster’s residence, perhaps something unexpected will occur."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's right..." There was a light flickering in the eyes of Ouyang Buping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; At this time, there were footsteps coming from the outside. it was namely Lin Baiyi coming in a rush, he had forgotten even to knock on the door. He directly pushed the door open, then realized what he did. Rushing out, he knocked again, then entered again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This pill genius of the Lin family had a shred of urgency in his expression. After giving his greetings, he quickly said, "Master, Ouyang Shishu, somethings terrible has happened, something terrible has happened... the recent news just now, the [Red Eagle], [Violet Eagle], [Snow Eagle] as well as [Sly Eagle] of the [Thirteen Cold-Blooded Eagles] had brought with them ten thousand elite forbidden army soldiers, and had completely surrouded the City of Light! The entire capital is about to boil!”&nbsp;</span></p>
