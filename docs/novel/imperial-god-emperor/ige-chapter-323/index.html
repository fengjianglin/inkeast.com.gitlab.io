 <p>Chapter 323 - The Chosen One</p>
 <p>The spectacle of the body changing into stars of the universe was a scene that only occurs when a top genius of the martial world broke through the Bitter Sea stage.</p>
 <p>Back when [Yin Yang Monarch] himself attacked the Bitter Sea stage with 93 Spirit springs, there was also such a spectacle. It was only that his derivation of the universe was incomplete, and only half of his body changed into the void of the universe. But even so, he ultimately reached the Ascending Heaven stage. In his era, he was absolutely considered as an exceptional genius, a truly awe-inspiring person.</p>
 <p>But this time, in the depths of the shrine, there were clearly 100 bright stars of the Spirit spring changing.</p>
 <p>One hundred stars!</p>
 <p>The [Yin Yang Monarch] only felt his mouth parched and tongue dry.</p>
 <p>It was said that during the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, only those supreme beings could achieve a full 100 Spirit springs. This number was only a number that existed in the theory of the most ideal martial arts breakthrough.</p>
 <p>At the side of the [Yin Yang Monarch], [Turtle Shell Immortal] was also similarly shuddering with apprehension.</p>
 <p>“There really is someone that can reach the level of 100 Spirit springs?”</p>
 <p>He was screaming in his heart.</p>
 <p>For so many years, there had never been such a genius that appeared. It was to such an extent that in the current Heaven Wasteland Domain, many people believed that the level of 100 Spirit springs was just a myth, or just a theoretical hypothesis. It was a hypothetical perfect state, and the reason it is called imaginary was because it was impossible to achieve.</p>
 <p>But now...</p>
 <p>A demon that defies the heavenly principles was going to appear?</p>
 <p>Just who was that person?</p>
 <p>Countless eyes were fixed on the inside of the shrine.</p>
 <p>“Look...” Ximen Yeshui quietly nudged Qin Zhishui. “See those two guys in the distance?”</p>
 <p>Qin Zhishui nodded.</p>
 <p>In the depths of the shrine, apart from the 100 stars, there were two blurred things floating up and down, also constantly absorbing the colourful light emitting from the books on the bookcases. Only the people that knew them well could recognize what the two things inside were, one of which was a white puppy.</p>
 <p>That dog, Qin Zhishui was certainly not unfamiliar with.</p>
 <p>It was the useless pet of Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Since the dog appeared in the shrine, it indicated that Ye Qingyu must also be in it.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui’s intuition was right.</p>
 <p>“Hey, I said that it must be my brother. This is interesting, us group of people had fought desperately to be ahead but in the end we only obtained the rune blue light seal. That guy, who had only been burying the dead along the way, unexpectedly buried himself in the shrine. This is luck, I must admit defeat,” Ximen Yeshui said with a pleased smile.</p>
 <p>He smiled very sincerely and very happily.</p>
 <p>He was not at all dispirited at the loss of his eligibility to enter the shrine, nor was there a trace of jealousy.</p>
 <p>Qin Zhishui glanced at him and did not speak.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui, this person... was strange.</p>
 <p>“What did you say? Little friend, is that really your friend inside?” [Turtle Shell Immortal] looked over in surprise, his tone of speech much more polite than before.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” Ximen Yeshui lifted his head and shot a glance at the Ascending Heaven stage expert, rolling his eyes. “What? You think I don’t know what you’re thinking. You’re just trying to get my brother to help you retrieve a manual of his Highness Luo So, right? Hey, it’s too late, old man, it won’t work.”</p>
 <p>[Turtle Shell Immortal’s] forehead immediately darkened.</p>
 <p>This brat really needs a good beating.</p>
 <p>On the other side, the [Yin Yang Monarch] looked hesitant.</p>
 <p>At this moment, an unexpected change appeared once again.</p>
 <p>In the shrine, there was a dazzling flash of lightning, a transparent wind-like strong qi shot towards the gate, and then like a pool of water, a faintly transparent figure flickered. The figure was slender and tall, and the hazy colour that was concealing his true features gave him a lofty aura of a peerless genius, as if a divine Emperor was walking towards them.</p>
 <p>“Fate and rules are clear, the opportunity of the palace has been decided. You all cannot go against the tide, otherwise you will be punished by the wrath of heaven.”</p>
 <p>A majestic voice surged forth from his mouth.</p>
 <p>This voice was the same majestic voice that had previously sounded in the air.</p>
 <p>“You are... your highness... Luo... So?”</p>
 <p>Someone exclaimed, looking momentarily terrified, and immediately thought of something.</p>
 <p>The doorway of the shrine.</p>
 <p>The transparent and hazy figure did not answer such a question, but also did not deny it.</p>
 <p>Plop.</p>
 <p>Someone had already knelt down.</p>
 <p>“Wang Linghe pays respect to the heavenly Sovereign of my Human Race.” An old, grey-haired man was incomparably excited. He sincerely knelt on the ground, performing the formal etiquette on meeting the emperor, like a fanatic believer seeing his god. Instantaneously, tears were streaming down his face.</p>
 <p>“I am not the true body,” the incomparably mighty figure opened his mouth.</p>
 <p>This sentence was tantamount to admitting his identity.</p>
 <p>In a split second, a lot more people also knelt down on the ground.</p>
 <p>The [Yin Yang Monarch] looked horrified, but in his mind there were thoughts constantly roaming around. He asked in a respectful tone, “Your highness is not the true body, then could it be his highness Luo So is still in this world?”</p>
 <p>“The body of an Emperor can never be destroyed.”</p>
 <p>The mighty and peerless figure said each word loud and clear.</p>
 <p>Before the voice died away.</p>
 <p>The blue light that was everywhere flashed, and the blue light markings engraved on the yellow slate on the public square, one after another, turned into a group of stars, suspended in the sky, and the yellow slate also disappeared at the same time. The entire public square, sacred mountain, and beaches below, as well as the distant blood sea all momentarily vanished, as if everything was just an illusion.</p>
 <p>Endless beams of light constantly streaked toward the incomparably powerful figure.</p>
 <p>A power far beyond the power of these people to even recognize loomed indistinctly in the palm of this figure.</p>
 <p>He stretched out his hand, as though he was holding the very world in his palm.</p>
 <p>Other Ascending Heaven existences as strong as [Yin Yang Monarch] and [Turtle Shell Immortal] all could not help kneeling in their original place, quivering with fear. At this moment, in the palm of the matchless figure was a power emerging, like it was a piece of the heaven and earth. If his palm slightly relaxed, it could destroy the whole world. The endless silk-like light gathered toward his palm, like divine swords of destruction.</p>
 <p>The Ascending Heaven experts in front of him were as weak as ants.</p>
 <p>“We pay our respects to his majesty!.”</p>
 <p>“The Human Race will prosper!”</p>
 <p>“With your Highness here, our Human Race will definitely rule all the million races.”</p>
 <p>Everybody was kneeling down on the ground.</p>
 <p>The news that the [Formation Sovereign] Luo So was still alive, once spread out, would absolutely set off endless waves in the thousand domains. For the Human Race that was declining in power, this was absolutely great news.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, the light had spread everywhere.</p>
 <p>Where the crowd was, all the scenery had disappeared.</p>
 <p>All around, up and down, left and right, the line of sight was only the dark void.</p>
 <p>The entire [Formation Sovereign’s] moving imperial palace had faded away like dust and ashes.</p>
 <p>The people were still kneeling and bowing their head in space.</p>
 <p>Only Ximen Yeshui was furtively crouching next to Qin Zhishui, an unbelievable look on his face. “Impossible, this is impossible...”</p>
 <p>“What’s impossible?” Qin Zhishui twisted his head around to ask.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui wanted to speak but stopped at a second thought, then finally shook his head and said, “Nothing, maybe I remembered it wrong.”</p>
 <p>“The palace blessing already has a master, therefore we cannot fight over its heart. The chosen one has the luck encircling around him, but he still needs careful assistance and protection. You must not have the slightest thought of disobedience and killing intent. Otherwise, the Three Sovereigns will reappear, the Five Emperors would come back, and you all will sink into eternal torment, without life and no death, and never be able to escape,” he mighty figure said, each word loud and clear.</p>
 <p>For every word he said, the stars in the void would flicker once.</p>
 <p>The whole world seemed to tremble at his very voice.</p>
 <p>And the dark blue light markings on the people’s palm would also flash once and heat up.</p>
 <p>This rune formation blue light seal contained infinite power. But at this moment, it seemed just a marking, a stamp, a brand that was stuck on their body, and they could not get rid of it.</p>
 <p>The [Yin Yang Monarch], [Turtle Shell Immortal] and other people were like insects under a clap of thunder, trembling all over. This was not an illusion, they could feel it very clearly. Their Ascending Heaven yuan qi, in front of this figure, was like gossamer that would be cut off at any time. This sort of awareness and fear came from their soul, almost as though it was imprinted in their martial spirit and they absolutely could not erase it.</p>
 <p>Brilliance flickering.</p>
 <p>The other people that had left were also directly sent back by the reversal of space and time.</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty, no need to worry. We will be sure to serve and assist the chosen one.” [Yin Yang Monarch] dared not disobey. He said such words with his voice quivering.</p>
 <p>“We will assist the chosen one with all our heart, even if we must sacrifice our lives, we would not hesitate in the slightest.”</p>
 <p>All people vowed.</p>
 <p>Facing the Sovereign of the Human Race, no one dared to display the slightest intention of disobedience.</p>
 <p>Even if the matchless figure in front was perhaps just a doppelganger, or just a wisp of divine thought of the formation emperor Luo So, but since Luo So had said so, then it shows that the person in the shrine, who had cultivated to the level of 100 Spirit springs, was an existence that defied the very heavens. It is possible that this person is the supreme candidate of the present age that the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had jointly elected to succeed them.</p>
 <p>The chosen child of Heavens!</p>
 <p>Even the [Yin Yang Monarch] and the other stubborn and unruly people obediently put away all other different thoughts.</p>
 <p>“Do not need to be too revealing and obvious, you can just secretly support him,” the matchless figure added. “Fate is encircled around him. He needs to improve, and earn things by himself. There is no need to rely on external forces, you all just wait for now.”</p>
 <p>The voice faded away.</p>
 <p>The matchless figure vanished.</p>
 <p>Everyone was still trembling in fear while kneeling in space. They dared not make the slightest movement.</p>
 <p>From the distant stars in the void, a bright starlight was flickering. 100 of the most brilliant stars from far and near slowly converged towards it, gradually condensing until there was a pale silver glow diffusing out, slowly forming a human shaped appearance. The humanoid was gradually revealed as 100 stars penetrated into his dantian.</p>
 <p>Long black hair falling on his shoulders like a waterfall, reaching his heels.</p>
 <p>His slender body had an imposing heroic appearance.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>He appeared before everyone’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Slowly he opened his eyes, and saw a mass of people kneeling in front, which were without a doubt the strong people he had seen before.</p>
