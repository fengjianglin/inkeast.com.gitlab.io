 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;A flood of silver clouds went roaring toward the depths of the starry sky. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor had fled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the most critical moment of the life-and-death confrontation, he chose to betray his ally, withdrew his power and fled toward the depths of the starry sky. His speed was extremely fast, exuding a very different imposing manner to when he split from his Dharma body and planned to die together. It was incredibly astonishing. Being a Quasi-emperor, no one had thought that he would choose to do so. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ancient macaque-resembling, lightning-wielding Quasi-emperor had been abandoned and betrayed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The supreme power of the [A smile overturns the sky], like a torrent, had thoroughly crushed the final will and strength of the Quasi-emperor, completely dispelling the green lightning and thunder force. This was the source of power of the Ancient macaque-resembling, lightning-wielding Quasi-emperor. But what was surprising was that, in this green thunderbolt, there was a strange black decaying force and a stench of monstrous corpses, which turned into a huge white skull, like the skull of a spirit from the ninth hell. This illusion lasted for a moment, before it began to spread... &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You...I hate.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the last voice that the ancient macaque-resembling, lightning-wielding Quasi-emperor left in this world. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clear that this sentence was aimed at the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect, rather than [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hated the fact that the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor had betrayed him and escaped at the most critical moment. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The once illustrious ancient Emperor had come to an end. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a change was unexpected, even for Li Xiaofei. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was naturally difficult to stop a Quasi-emperor who wanted to escape. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not to mention that the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor had obviously planned this in advance. He had made use of the psychology of the crowd to make others think that he would fight to the death. Who would have thought that he would take advantage of the ancient macaque-resembling, lightning-wielding Quasi-emperor to block [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], while he escaped in a hurry and disappeared in the blink of an eye...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the old man Quasi-emperor was not able to react in time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The great Quasi-emperor battle had come to an end. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For all of the experts, it was both sad and happy. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu, the Crown Prince of the Black Demon Abyss, and the others were extremely happy and glad, but the Four Stars holy girl was standing in the Void in a daze, as though her spine had been removed. Her face was devoid of expression, and it was evident that the defeat of the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor was absolutely a huge blow to her, which she could not accept. On the other side, the [Fatally Beautiful Fairy] had already began to slowly retreat toward the depths of the universe, with the intent to escape... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two flashes of green starlight eventually landed in the hands of [Fatally Beautiful Fairy] Jiang Xiaohan. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A green brilliance flashed, wrapping around her, and Jiang Xiaohan's figure had vanished from sight. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the last moment, the deceased ancient macaque-resembling, lightning-wielding Quasi-emperor had unexpectedly sent away Jiang Xiaohan. When a man is near death his words are kind. The Quasi-emperor had used his last trace of power to send away his Emperor weapon and successor. It was obvious that he hoped that Jiang Xiaohan could pass on his martial arts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The experts of other sides were all slowly retreating. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the end of the Quasi-emperor battle, the next step was to differentiate the new structure of forces. Who knew what kind of choice that [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] would make.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was said to be an unyielding supporter of the Human Race. It was unknown how many experts of other races he had killed before. In this Quasi-emperor war, there were many people who did not stand in the stance of the Human Race and thus were also extremely restless, afraid that [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] would destroy them all after his great victory in order to eliminate all the roots. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] still showed no intention of taking action. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It's finally over.” The figure of the old man Quasi-emperor slowly shrank back in size, eventually resuming his normal state. His hair shortened, and he seemed to be a little exhausted. As he came to Lu Wei's side, he was swaying, as though it was difficult to stand up firmly. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandpa?” Lu Wei, who sensed something strange, quickly assisted the old man. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man shook his head slightly, “I'm fine.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's eyes flashed a thoughtful expression. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the starry sky, [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], who was blood-soaked, was like an immemorial mountain that cannot be climbed. His blood was burning, and his whole Dharma body seemed to have turned into a huge fireball. In fact, his aura was so strong and tyrannical that it was much more terrifying than when he faced the three Quasi-emperors. Moreover, he did not show the slightest intention of withdrawing his aura to heal, but seemed to be activating his strength at all costs, and constantly adjusting his state! &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is he going to strike the Emperor barrier?” The voice of the million-year-old soul sounded. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He came to Ye Qingyu's side. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strike the Emperor barrier?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], at this moment, in this state, was going to strike the real martial arts Emperor boundary? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Li Xiaofei... is unbelievably adjusting his battle will and imposing manner with the help of the Quasi-emperor battle, treating the three great Quasi-emperors as grindstones in order to strike the martial arts Emperor realm. This person... whether or not he was successful in the end, with this spirit, this heart, he can already be called peerless. From the beginning, he did not attach any importance to the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor or the other two Quasi-emperors?” the million-year-old soul said emotionally. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was an existence of the Spirits Age, who had continued to exist in the present age due to a coincidence and opportunity. It was unknown how many peerless heaven's prideling experts he had seen before, and even if he had seen martial arts Emperors before, at this moment he also could not help feeling deeply moved. In the heart of the million-year-old soul, whether it was Ye Qingyu or Li Xiaofei, both were exceptional peerless genius. And in the ancient times, the emergence of such a genius could already dominate an era, but now they had appeared at the same time... &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps the true flourishing period is coming, just like the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, which was like pouring oil onto a flame... A real golden period is coming, but such a great era is bound to be full of killing and all kinds of unknown. Throughout the ancient and modern times, geniuses had always emerged in batches. It is difficult to predict who could go to the end. Back then how magnificent were the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, but ultimately they all... ” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-year-old soul sighed inwardly. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the imposing manner and aura of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was still ascending at an incredible and frantic speed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blood in his Dharma body seemed to be flowing and burning, and his tremendous body was shrouded in blood red flames. The terrifying power, like a surging tide, was gushing towards the vast darkness of the starry sky. The experts were like little boats in the midst of a stormy sea, retreating repeatedly. This was only the aura naturally overflowing out from [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], yet it was difficult to control their body. Moreover, the rotating stars in the distance were disturbed by this strange force, breaking away from the orbit, colliding with one another, and erupted in terrifying flames... &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This... is infinitely close to that of a real Emperor.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars holy girl exclaimed in a daze. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could it be that Li Xiaofei really is going to cross that step.” A Great Saint of the Demon Race exclaimed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people's hearts jumped to their throat. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Were they really going to witness the birth of a martial arts Emperor? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a historic moment. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It should be said that a martial arts Emperor had not emerged in thousands of years. Would they really witness such a historic moment today? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If a martial arts Emperor were to emerge in the Human Race, what kind of impact would it have on the structure of forces in the whole world? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless thoughts flashed across the minds of all of the experts. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu also opened his eyes wide. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The imposing manner of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] continued to increase. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blue-green chaos mist began to generate from his body. This was the real aura of chaos. Between the heavens and earth there seemed to be some sort of power gathering together, and an invisible pressure was spreading. It seemed as though the whole world was shaking. In the vast Void, there were strange ripples being born, although invisible to the naked eye, and unperceivable by remarkable abilities, all experts had a strange feeling, as if there was something, some sort of power, moving frantically toward [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Carrying the mandate of heaven,” the million year-old soul exclaimed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The colour of surprise on his face grew stronger. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because he saw that Li Xiaofei had come to this point, which was the most critical stage of hitting the real Emperor realm. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why a martial arts Emperor was stronger than a Quasi-emperor was not because of the cultivation base and power, but in the ascension of innate character, being recognized by the heavens and earth, and truly carrying the will of this heaven and earth. Each and every word and thought represented the power of the heavens and earth. This was the terror of a martial arts Emperor. A Quasi-emperor can only carry a little of the mandate of heaven——or more accurately, can only touch the edge of the mandate of heaven. For example Li Xiaofei, for four thousand years the extent of the mandate of heaven that he had touched can only be regarded as carrying one or two percent of the mandate of heaven. While new Quasi-emperors such as Quasi-emperor Mushan and the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect had not even touched upon one thousandth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That's the root cause of their defeat in the hands of Li Xiaofei. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a pity that they did not know even in death. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And Li Xiaofei was clearly touching upon the true profound meaning of a martial arts Emperor. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, at the beginning, the million-year-old soul was not too optimistic about Li Xiaofei. After all, it was not easy to become a true martial arts Emperor. Of those who had successfully set foot on the peak, which one was not an unmatched existence that had been through countless tribulations and had the help of the heavens and earth? Although Li Xiaofei had defeated three great Quasi-emperors, but compared to the distinguished people in the past it was still not enough... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now... was he really going to succeed? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-year-old soul did not know. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wouldn’t really be so in defiance of the natural order, right? &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The imposing manner between the heavens and earth was becoming more and more terrifying. [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was blazing, his body gradually growing fainter, but the pressure was still ascending, as if he was about to detach from the world. Each of the chaos hurricanes that was visible to the naked eye was at least millions of kilometers long, forming and curling around his huge dharma body. Among which there was even the power of lightning and thunder bombarding his Dharma body... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tribulation!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-year-old soul was incomparably shocked. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Only he knew how amazing it was to get to this point. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was this human really going to go against the natural order? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the present era, could someone really break that seal force and step onto the peak?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He found it hard to believe, but the truth was just before his eyes. [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was going to succeed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu, though not fully understanding the situation, had already vaguely sensed something from the information he had. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was invincible, and was still constantly ascending to no end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed by. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the eyes of the old man Quasi-emperor, there was a look of incomparable nervousness. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Xiaofei was surrounded by chaos hurricanes, like several giant chaos snakes of millions of kilometers long was coiling around his body. Lightning fell endlessly, faintly discernible in the chaos storm, and constantly bombarded his Dharma body... &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden—— &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Void of the universe, a ripple flashed and the Void broke open. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An incomparably tremendous grey-copper temple slowly appeared from the Void crack, suppressing Li Xiaofei's Dharma body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The unexpected change was something that nobody had ever thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Li Xiaofei seemed to have predicted this a long time ago, laughing he said, “You have already imprisoned me for four thousand years, you still refuse to stop? You want to block me from becoming Emperor? Are you guys that afraid of a new Emperor emerging from the Human Race? You are willing to go against the taboo to attack me, do you know the price you will have to pay?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was greatly shocked. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For he could tell that the grey-copper temple was very familiar. It was the building that had once imprisoned Li Xiaofei in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had come out of the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss and got here?</span></p>
