 <p>Chapter 557, Blood Rainstorm (3)&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Time is fleeting for a cultivator.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu observed all the martial arts duels, and in the end, he had to close his eyes to rest for some time, to continue watching.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Because the platform had become like a river of blood, bones piling like a mountain, even if he had seen much before, he was still affected by the murderous spirit and couldn't control the killing intent emerging inside of him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu must be able to calm himself at all times to seize the opportunity to rescue Yu Xiaoxing.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the third day, Ye Qingyu suddenly found a very strange phenomenon.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Huh? This Storm Platform, after being soaked in blood for two days, seemed to have livened up.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had been suspicious of the Storm Platform all along; every time a battle came to an end he would pay special attention to the changes of the Storm Platform. With the steady stream of blood, the colour and luster of the Storm Platform had become extremely mysterious, as if it had gained energy and life force, and lights of bloodlines loomed around the tremendous black mountains.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The Storm Platform, like a demonic structure, had concealed the eyes of many people, silently observing the bones and blood of the dead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Could there be another reason for Greater One Sect to reopen the Storm Platform?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Just as Ye Qingyu was filled with many doubts and puzzlement, there were new changes occurring on the Storm Platform again.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the Storm Platform.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Hahaha, who dares fight with me?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A charming and handsome youngster in a bright inner robe and blue cotton outer garment that were stained with blood was laughing wildly.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The corner of the youngster’s left eye was a red mole that added a bit of evil to his appearance.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He was already on the battle platform, challenging seven people in a row.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The seven people who were challenged had turned into corpses at his feet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>At this moment he was standing with his hands clasped behind his back, his mouth curved in a playful and uninhibited smile. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>There was yuan qi visibly rushing forth from his body, strong and overbearing, the light flames of the yuan qi was as if it was transforming into a tiger beast behind him. From the brilliance of the yuan qi was the howling of tigers from time to time, attracting the spirits and beasts within hundreds of miles of the Storm Platform. With the roaring, the atmosphere suddenly grew serious.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“That youngster has a strong murderous nature.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked at the young man in blue, frowning slightly.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Many of the previous battles on the Storm Platform were caused from a vendetta, while this blue-robed youngster was only randomly choosing his opponents, there were no reasons of enmity or hatred. Everyone could tell that the blue-robed youngster was not here to solve enmity, but to kill and challenge. To satisfy his desire to kill.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Before Ye Qingyu heard the Encyclopedia of Clear River Domain Hu Bugui introduce the background of this youngster, he had heard many voices of discussion around the floating peak.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Isn't that Mo Fengqing?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Mo Fengqing? The Mo Fengqing who had consecutively challenged the successor of more than 20 major sects over the past tens years and had never lost a battle, and quickly rose to the top 30 young talents of Clear River Domain?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Yes, yes, that's him.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“It is that homicidal maniac.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Yes, this kid has a very strong murderous nature and is crazy. Did you know he especially challenged the carefully-trained up new talents. He kills at every battle, and had brought endless headaches to many sects.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Yes, the people he challenged today were the experts who had threatened to teach him a lesson or to stop him from killing.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the Storm Platform.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Mo Fengqing had yuan qi light flames circling around his body, blood light floating above his head, and murderous spirits that were like blood clouds, thick with killing intent.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The aura of clear clouds was wrapped around the Clear Wind sword in his hand, and his posture was arrogant to the extreme.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Hahaha, a group of useless people, no one can receive my sword attacks, hehe, yet you all threatened to teach me a lesson... Haha, haha!” He said, kicking off the bodies on the platform of the people that he had killed. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Haha, who dares fight with me?” Mo Fengqing pointed his sword around the floating peak, his posture was extremely arrogant.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>For a while, many of the sect experts were taken aback by the sharpness of his sword. No one dared say a word.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Haha, no one dares to challenge me? Next, who am I going to challenge? Ha, who will be the next misfortunate guy?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Mo Fengqing laughed wildly, wearing a smug look on his face and looking more crazy. The sword in his hand was gently raised, slowly pointing around.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Everyone had a change of expression on their face.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In the end, Mo Fengqing unexpectedly pointed to the floating peak that the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect was on. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Yes, it is you, the successor of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect. Come up, haha, come up and let me crush you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He laughed wildly.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Before his voice faded.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>There was an uproar around the Storm Platform.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“What? He dares challenge the successor of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect? “</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“I think this kid isn't afraid of dying.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“I don’t think so. Although the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect is famous, but the ability of the successor is still unknown.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Right, right, I have been waiting for this for a long time, today I can see the remarkable skills of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Although the people were whispering to one another, their eyes were fixed in the direction of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect; their interest was suddenly ignited.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The atmosphere suddenly became tense and heated.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>It was a big deal for the successor of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect to be challenged.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Above a distant floating peak.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Clad all in black with a solemn mask, the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect’s successor’s eyes flashed with killing intent beneath the strange mask.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He stood upright slowly.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Slow, but very calm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Under the sun, this slightly thin figure was charming and tall, straight as a javelin. The expression of the mask was extremely silent and still, and no one knew what kind of expression was on the mysterious face hidden under mask.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Are you sure you want to challenge me?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The successor of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect uttered.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>His voice, like being cut by a knife, was sonorously blunt, without the slightest humanly emotions, as if it came from a machine.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In the distance.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Huh? That voice...”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>For some reason, when Ye Qingyu heard this voice his face suddenly took on a look of astonishment.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He vaguely felt that this voice was a little familiar, that he seemed to have heard it somewhere before, but he couldn't remember.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the Storm Platform.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“It seems that your mask has affected your hearing, and even more affected your judgment, hehe... Is it shocking? Then prick up your ears and listen, come up here and die, I am going to kill you on this platform.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Mo Fengqing said with a provoking look in his eyes, the blue light of the Clear Wind sword slightly vibrating, the sword light flashing infinitely.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The arrogance and unruliness he showed were bordering on madness.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Fine.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The successor of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect nodded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He stepped out and soared, disappearing in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>There was only half a shadow left in his previous position.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The crowd had just felt a blur in front of their eyes, and before they could see clearly the traces of the figure, the next moment he was standing on the Storm Platform.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>His figure was skinny, his black robe seemed more silent, as he stood there quietly with an imposing posture and a clear but unseen murderous intent that chilled everyone to the bone.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Stop pretending to be mysterious. After I kill you, I’ll rip off your clown mask, so that everyone can see whether it is a ghost or human hidden beneath the mask.” Mo Fengqing gave a grim and resounding laugh. His laughter echoed in the ears of the audience. “</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Tyrannical sword intent erupted from Mo Fengqing’s sword, sharp and penetrating, as if was about to isolate the world, sending shivers down one’s spine.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>But the successor of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect stood 10 meters away, an aura around his whole body flickering infinitely, like a candle in the wind, or a clear breeze, endless and elusive.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He lifted his palm, stretching out into the void.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A sword of multicoloured flowing light appeared in the palm of his hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Among the sword qi were waves of dazzling flowing lights of various colours rising and falling, skilfully and with ease. The flowing lights at the edge of the blade illuminated the boundaries of the Storm Platform. Although there were no sword shadows seen, the bounded walls were like ripples spreading out by the impact of the sword qi.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The cultivation and foundation of the successor of Heaven Devastator Demon Sect was hard to distinguish.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“I’ll give you the chance to attack first.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The voice of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect was still devoid of emotions, but there was a bizarre power tapping into the heart of everyone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Arrogant, you’re looking for death. Ha ha, in that case, don't blame me for not giving you the opportunity to attack. Watch how I kill you in one move.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Mo Fengqing thundered wildly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The next moment he drew his sword.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A sky splitting sword intent burst forth, his body transformed into a stream of light, darting towards the successor of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The Heaven Devastator Demon Sect’s successor stood motionless for a moment. It was only until Mo Fengqing’s sword tip was within an inch of his body that he suddenly shook, and a yuan qi sword emerged in his hand and slashed across like a night lightning.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The clang of metal striking together resounded.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In a flash, Mo Fengqing and the successor of Heaven Devastator Demon Sect had swapped positions, standing back-to-back.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Only the very slight rustling of leaves could be heard.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“This... it's over?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The people in the crowd that reacted first questioned.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The two people were standing back to back, and did not turn around. Had the battle ended?</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>As the crowd stood stunned with disbelief, another change happened.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Bang!&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Mo Fengqing’s Clear Wind sword that had lost its luster was slipping from his hand, producing a crisp snap, and from his left shoulder to the right waist of the body was a smooth and subtle wound. Then, suddenly blood squeezed out, and his body that was slashed across was seen collapsing to the ground like a tree being cut down across the middle.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Mo' Fengqing still wore his usual laughing expression.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>As if space had frozen.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>It seemed as if time had slipped away under his nose.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>All the people were aghast.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>That brief sword light, that brief attack, that brief eruption of killing intent...</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>What happened in that moment?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>There were not many people who saw it clearly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The Heaven Devastator Demon Sect successor sheathed his sword, turning lightly around to leave.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu also couldn’t help but sigh.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu also could not see clearly. That moment when the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect successor made a move, which was similar to a fire meteor shooting across, even with his eyesight, he had just vaguely caught a little bit of the blade arc, but was unsure how he attacked. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“This Heaven Devastator Demon Sect really is indeed a super major sect, the strength of the successor is most likely far above mine. If I had to face this person then I must be really careful, I have a bad feeling that his sword skills is close to the Dao, and can break through the defense of my physical body.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu speculated in his mind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>If Clear River Domain really invaded Heaven Wasteland Domain, then the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect would become the enemy of Ye Qingyu, so he instinctively considered the successor of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect as an imaginary enemy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Before Ye Qingyu could give it some more thought, there was another thunder-like roar on the Storm Platform.&nbsp;</p>
