 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After some hesitation, they decided that they couldn't afford to take this risk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All three of them didn't act rashly. Neither did they move the pill furnaces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hehe, there are so many pill furnaces and they all look like they are in great condition. I'm sure that they definitely contain some treasures… They might contain the medicinal pills refined by the first god of alchemy. If I manage to get my hands on one of that, I will be rich. Ha ha ha…" Hu Bugui was overjoyed and excitedly explored the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Nine was also unable to control his curiosity and had already entered the Yin-Yang Bagua Picture. He sniffed his way around and his tail wagged excitedly</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were in the [Tusita Palace].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this was truly the legendary [Tusita Palace], they would have struck gold. They could simply pry open any pill furnace to extract a tiny bit of its medicinal pills. Even if they only managed to obtain the tiniest medicinal pill that had the ability to increase their cultivation, it would be equivalent to an expert cultivating for hundreds and thousands of years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had truly stumbled on some treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Old Hu Bugui, our luck must be pretty good. It looks as though no one else has been here before and we are the first visitors." Ye Qingyu soon had a brief understanding of this place after he released his divine sense and studied his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha ha, this sounds even better. I knew that you had a knack for finding your way around this place. I simply followed you as you walked randomly around and then we found ourselves here. It was as though this place fell right into our laps. With my many years of grave digging… ah, no, exploring, if I found myself in a maze, I would probably still be stuck inside right now. He he he, if we get our hands on the treasure later on, I’ll only take ten percent of it. The rest belongs to you!" Hu Bugui's eyes were bright and he couldn't wait to start prying open these pill furnaces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was also a little excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-year-old soul had indeed been telling the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it wouldn't be easy extracting the treasures from these pill furnaces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ye Qingyu released his divine sense earlier, he could already tell that every single one of these pill furnaces was sealed by an ancient and mysterious divine technique. It was held together by a powerful restraining force that made opening it extremely difficult. He couldn't use his divine sense to peer inside the pill furnaces either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The force that has sealed the pill furnaces is both profound and mysterious. I doubt opening it would be an easy task."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu surmised after he careful contemplation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui gradually calmed down and reined in his excitement. He carefully examined the pill furnaces near him and saw that there was a circle of inky blue mist swirling near the mouth and the furnace of each pill furnace as though they were chained together. The force contained within the mist was ancient, mysterious and as deep as the sea. It was clearly different compared to the sealing techniques for pill furnaces used in the current era.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, since these treasures were within their reach, they couldn't leave without collecting them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He thought for a moment and before he decided to give it a shot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chief bandit put on his fighting stance and his eyes shone brightly with excitement and eagerness as he said, "Ha ha, that's not a problem. While it is true that these pill furnaces look tough to pry open but the profound sealing technique shows how important the treasures contained within it are. Now that we're already here, we must show the first god of alchemy our skills."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he dug out a brownish-gold lock that was in the shape of a semi-circle. It looked a little worn and it was covered in rust as though it was a broken artifact that was dug out from a grave. Then, he muttered a string of words, "The heaven has no bounds and the earth reveal thy beams… [Golden Omen Exquisite Lock], activate!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As though the brownish-gold lock was suddenly awakened, a wisp of brownish-gold light flew from the lock like lightning and madly surrounded the pill furnace in front of Hu Bugui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A grinding sound could constantly be heard, as though bronze and stone were grinding against each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That tiny lock unleashed a profound and subtle force that was like an extremely sharp steel knife as it slowly infiltrated the opening of the pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huh?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui had such a treasure?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was a little surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On second thought, this bandit was often digging graves and wouldn't have been able to survive if he didn't have at least several trump cards. He probably managed to collect a large number of treasures and carry out such smooth grave digging expeditions each time because of this lock that could unlock seals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at the golden and blue swirls of mist that surrounded the pill furnace and felt a little hopeful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, Hu Bugui suddenly frowned and cried out, "It doesn't work? I can't believe it didn't work! How could this be? Little Ye Qingyu, look here. The mist above that pill furnace is extremely mysterious and it even swallowed the aura unleashed by my unlocking treasure."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu looked in the direction of the pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw that of the two intermingling mists earlier, only the inky-blue mist remained while the mist released by the golden lock had almost been completely swallowed. After swallowing the golden mist, the mist surrounding that pill furnace grew livelier and its aura became more abundant, as though a mysterious force that had been dormant for a long time was awakened from its hibernation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Uh…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The seal technique was able to absorb the aura and force of the unlocking technique? This was way too peculiar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's brows were tightly knotted and he fell into a daze as he stared at the pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were some extraordinary pill furnaces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its extraordinariness meant that the probability of it containing a precious treasure was very high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui looked slightly dejected as he kept the golden lock he used to unlock things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's alright. If the first plan doesn't work, I still have the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth plan. I'm sure one of them would be able to unlock this pill furnace."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He spoke as though he was trying to cheer himself on. Then, his spirits lifted and he dug out several exotic and peculiar unlocking treasures from his sleeves and magic treasure pouch and started to try them out one at a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten minutes later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is my final unlocking treasure. I can't believe it didn't budge at all. The first god of alchemy's pill furnace is too goddamn tight!" Hu Bugui wailed, his disappointment and reluctance written all over his face as he held a magical item that was shaped like a ball in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Woof, Mr. Gravedigger, you've failed, haven't you? If we can't do it via gentle means, let's try forcing it open then. You'll still need me to show up at the crucial moment!" Little Nine who was sniffing his way around in the corner had already completely lost his patience. It suddenly turned back and rushed over, proudly showing off his sharp teeth, its tail wagging as it walked toward the pill furnace. "Watch me, you useless gravedigger."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You?" Hu Bugui was annoyed by its provocation. "Try opening it then, since you claim to be so good."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Nine looked at Hu Bugui with a mixture of contempt and disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It jumped and its chubby body sailed through the air to stand near the mouth of the pill furnace. Then, it smiled "I knew you'd underestimate me. My nose has the ability to leave a mark on the Wall of Storm, so is there anything else my teeth can't open?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You? The Wall of Storm?" Hu Bugui looked astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had never left Clear River Domain, he was a very well-informed chief bandit, so he was very familiar with the legend of the Wall of Storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But… That dog's nose, the Wall of Storm…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Impossible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui looked at Ye Qingyu with a question in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t expect little Ye Qingyu to nod in amusement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was… was it true?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did this mean that other than eating, sleeping and running away, this silly dog also had a diamond defensive body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shock was written all over Hu Bugui's face but he quickly recovered. No wonder so many experts were after this silly dog while they were at the Wei River Mountain Range. He thought that those people were blind then but he didn't realize that he was the blind one…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Nine ignored Hu Bugui's astonished gaze and immediately pounced toward the mouth of the pill furnace and started frantically gnawing on it as though it was the most delicious food in the world. It was trying to bite a hole through the seal of this pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Arrhwoo… Arhh arhhh arhh... woo..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Nine was very excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it stopped after more than a dozen breaths and panted heavily. "Woof, oh my god. How could this be… I can't even open it with my teeth. What is this goddamn thing anyway? I gnawed at it with all my might but my teeth didn't even leave a mark!" it exclaimed in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its dejected wails sounded similar to Hu Bugui's cries earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was also rather surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sigh, little Ye Qingyu, you're the only one who has yet to make a move amongst us. Why don't you try too?" Hu Bugui turned to Ye Qingyu and said with a sigh. He felt disappointment wash over him once more and couldn't even muster the energy to mock the silly dog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes, human, why don't you go? We’ve already laid out the foundation and loosened the restraints of the pill furnace. We'll leave the final step to you," Little Nine said shamelessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It obviously didn’t want to miss out on the treasure within the pill furnace either and its eyes shone fawningly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu nodded and walked up to the front of the pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn't practical to break this pill furnace since the hundreds of pill furnaces here were all interconnected. If he broke one of them, the rest would be affected. Furthermore, destroying it might cause the treasure within it to lose its spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had to use the gentlest method to remove the seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was silent for a short while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, a plan gradually came to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint silver splendor swirled around all ten fingers on his right hand, then he started drawing in the Void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he continued to draw, it wasn't clear what he was drawing with each stroke he took and his drawing resembled a child's graffiti.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His fingers brushed past and the silver splendor remained in the Void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moments later, he only made a few strokes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There wasn't a single energy wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Woof… what are you doing? Drawing? I can do that too… sigh, human, you… Forget it. If you can't do it, then let's give up and hurry on to our next destination. We might even be able to collect some remnants of what the others have left behind," Little Nine was a little disappointed. It stretched and sprawled out in the corner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu drew the final stroke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strange silverish-grey formation appeared in the Void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sweat beads rolled down his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He opened his palm and suddenly pushed at this strange silverish-grey formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silverish-grey formation landed on the pill furnace in front of him as though it had taken on a solid form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the main hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A clear and melodious sound echoed through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sealing mist of the small pill furnace in front of him that was about as tall as a man suddenly disappeared mysteriously and the pill furnace lid that was shaped like a sacred tripod was slowly lifted by a strange force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A rich and fragrant scent wafted through the entire hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It… has been opened?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui rushed over in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was equally stunned. He had initially planned to give up but later suddenly recalled the one hundred eight ancient characters of the [Cloud Top Cauldron] and used an occult technique from that bronze cauldron to send one of the characters toward the pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn't expect it to work!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After they got over their initial shock, they were both overjoyed and rushed over to peer into the pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right in the middle of the pill furnace was a lotus-shaped holder made from black rock and more than a hundred light purple pills were placed within it. These pills were about the size of a longan and they were shiny and crystalline, like pearls or the moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All around these pills were waves of abundant Immortal qi. The mysterious fragrance was so strong that it was visible and swirled around these pills. They only sniffed a little bit of its fragrance but immediately felt refreshed and energized.&nbsp;</span></p>
