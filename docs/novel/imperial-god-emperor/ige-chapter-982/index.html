 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu kept the [Blood Drinker Sword Pill].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the sword pill feasted on the blood essence of dozens of Saints of the foreign race, it turned as crimson as the twilight mist. It was crystalline and bright, its color increasing in intensity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu couldn't help but be slightly surprised by the energy contained within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [Blood Drinker Sword Pill] was many times more powerful than the incomplete large sword in the past and its ability to refine the blood essence had also increased by many times. However, he didn't rush to immediately extract the energy contained within it, but instead chose to keep this energy contained within the [Blood Drinker Sword Pill]. He would use it as a trump card and guessed that it could be wielded to its fullest potential at a crucial moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he flipped his hand and the [Blood Drinker Sword Pill] disappeared into his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His expression suddenly changed at that moment for he felt a wave of extremely terrifying energy on him, as though it had passed through countless mountains and rivers to find him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wave of energy wasn't a killing intent but it was more frightening. It contained a terrifying authority that brooked no resistance, as though it was trying to peer through every single part of his body. It even seemed like it was trying to twist and change his fate and was extremely mysterious. He felt like an invisible god was peering down at him from above and that there was no good will in this energy at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What... what is going on?" He couldn't hold back his shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the black rock that hung from his waist trembled slightly and released a wisp of smoke that instantly shrouded him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That terrifying energy immediately broke apart and disappeared without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Senior?" Ye Qingyu asked in surprise via telepathy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Someone is trying to use the Emperor Detection Technique to deduce your movements as well as your fate. This person seems to be a Quasi-emperor,” the million-year-old soul's voice sounded from the black rock. "I managed to block it for you but he seemed to have caught a glimpse. You must be careful from now on since you can't afford to run into him. You aren't his match so if he sees you, you'll die for sure."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was extremely shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He immediately realized that it must have been the Quasi-emperor brother of that handsome young man. That Quasi-emperor must have already received news about his brother's death and was probably trying to find the murderer, instantly deducing that the murderer was Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to legend, Emperors of the martial way had a deep insight into the laws and could draw on the power of laws to deduce anything. This was known as the Emperor Detection Technique, thus the person who had found him earlier must have at least been a Quasi-emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thankfully, the million-year-old soul had helped him avert this disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Many thanks," he thanked the soul telepathically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fact that the million-year-old soul could soundlessly sense that it was a Quasi-emperor activating the Emperor Detection Technique, it went to show that the soul must have been extremely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No problem. I also sensed that besides the Emperor Detection Technique earlier, there seemed to be another force that was secretly protecting you, but it merely flickered then disappeared..." the million-year-old soul said, then sank deep into contemplation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another force?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was slightly surprised and couldn't figure out what it could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He paused, then shook his head, deciding to put this matter aside for now. He walked over to the dried up corpse of the handsome young man and raised his hand, summoning the [Wandering Dragon Cloud Sucking Spear] to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His wrist shook and instantly, thousands of green radiances burst from the dragon's mouth, twinkling like thousands of wintery stars in the night sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is a great spear!" He couldn't help but exclaim joyously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was also a great spear master, so the moment he held the spear, he immediately knew how extraordinary this weapon was. There were formations all over the insides of the spear and the spear body was made of Flowing Bronze Immortal Gold, while the spear point was made of emerald mithril and could pierce through the body of a Great Saint. When activated after injecting his yuan qi into it, it became a peerless lethal weapon. This divine spear was probably of Great Saint grade and it might not have even been in the possession of an average Great Saint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This spear was really wasted in your hands, just like casting pearls before swine."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He said as he looked at the corpse of the handsome young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished speaking, this corpse disintegrated with a bang and turned into thousands of sand-like shards that spilled all over the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother Hu Bugui, I'm taking this spear. I'll exchange this for the finished products of ten divine pills later on," Ye Qingyu said with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui also laughed as he said, "Haha, you killed that man, so it belongs to you. There's no need to give me any more divine pills since I've already gained so much just by following you today."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled but didn't say anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He'd definitely had to find a way to make it up to Hu Bugui later on. Anyway, being as close as they were, if he tried to push back, he'd look a little pretentious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They both remained calm and temporarily cast aside the matter of how they had offended a Quasi-emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother Ye Qingyu, we can't stay here for long. We have to collect these divine pills as soon as possible, then leave immediately," Hu Bugui said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu nodded, then his gaze swept across the hundreds of pill furnaces beside him. After some thought, he said, "You're right. However, there are just too many of these pill furnaces at [Tusita Palace]. It would take a lot of energy to open them all one at a time, not to mention that we'll also be wasting time. Based on my estimations, we would need at least three days and nights to open them all. If other stronger experts find their way here, we might not necessarily be their match... Why don't we take them all with us, then find a hidden place to open them all later when we have time?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Take... take them all?" Hu Bugui's eyes were filled with surprise and he couldn't stop himself from reminding him, "Little Ye Qingyu, these pill furnaces are arranged in the order of Yin-Yang and the five elements. If we move them too hastily, we might inadvertently destroy the divine effectiveness of the pills within them. Furthermore, where are we going to find a storage container big enough to store all these pill furnaces?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Haha, that would be easy," Ye Qingyu said with a small smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had already formulated a plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He mentally summoned the [Cloud Top Cauldron] which then appeared and spun above his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bronze lid of the cauldron automatically flew open and twinkling yellow mist flowed out of the cauldron just like fog. Wisps of Immortal qi circulated around and the entire aura of the [Tusita Palace] inexplicably became more radiant and enchanting. Ye Qingyu felt a little surprised for he had a strange feeling that a mysterious change had taken place in the [Cloud Top Cauldron] while it was in this primeval world environment. It seemed to operate a lot smoother and faster than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The origins of this bronze cauldron are shrouded in mystery. It is probably a Saint artifact from the Fiendgod Age as well. The environment here in the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor is no different from how it used to be during the Fiendgod Age. Could this be the cause of its change?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu mused to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this was not important at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He operated it with his mysterious technique and the [Cloud Top Cauldron] spun as it slowly rose to mid-air. It then tipped forward slightly and its glowing golden silk ribbons swayed gently. Next, an exceptionally mysterious energy that contained the divine power of the Great Dao instantly radiated from the mouth of the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pill furnaces on the ground shook slightly, then the bright yellow mist wrapped itself around these furnaces and swept them into the bronze cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui's eyes bulged in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In less than four breaths, the hundreds of pill furnaces within the palace were swept into the [Cloud Top Cauldron].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu used his divine sense to reconstruct the Yin-Yang Bagua Formation within the [Cloud Top Cauldron] that was almost exactly the same as the one in the palace. He arranged these pill furnaces in the same order that they had been placed earlier. Just as he expected, after he retracted the bright yellow mist, there was no change to those pill furnaces and their formation remained intact with no damage to their contents either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he recalled the [Cloud Top Cauldron] which gradually grew smaller as it spun before it turned into a ray of light that entered his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother Hu Bugui, once we're out of this place, let's find a safe place to divide the divine pills within the pill furnaces," he said as he turned to Hu Bugui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strange emotion swept over Hu Bugui. His eyes lit up and he agreed, nodding heavily with a smile, "Sure!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui felt that it was an incredible opportunity for him to obtain a small portion of these divine pills, since little Ye Qingyu had been the one doing all the work to get them into the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor and lead them safely into the [Tusita Palace]. He would have been satisfied with those few pills he had obtained but he didn't expect little Ye Qingyu to consistently insist on dividing the pills between him, little Nan Tieyi and even that silly dog. His mental state had surpassed even the Great Saints and was probably comparable to a Quasi-emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One's mental state was an extremely profound concept to a martial artist. There was no way to cultivate it via mysterious techniques, neither could it increase one’s combat strength, but it would determine one's limit on the martial way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui asked himself if he would do the same and concluded that he probably would not be as nonchalant as little Ye Qingyu when faced with such tempting treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the silly dog that was still lying prone on Ye Qingyu's shoulder seemed to be slowly regaining consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its limbs remained in a strange stiffened state but it could at least move its tail slightly. Its eyes roved around and it could also open its mouth slightly. However, its tongue was still rather stiff but it salivated the moment it heard Ye Qingyu mention dividing those pills and rushed to speak anxiously, "Woof... Woof, gimme more orf dem... (Give me more of them)"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was left momentarily dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hahaha, silly dog, are you drunk? Or is your tongue swollen? We can't understand you at the rate you keep slurring your words!" Hu Bugui felt his spirits lift and immediately reached to grab Silly Dog's pink tongue that hung out of its mouth. Then he stretched it like a rubber band before releasing it, seizing this chance to tease Little Nine while it was unable to retaliate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Schtinky hands (Stinky Hands)! Bah... gerroff (Get off!)!" Little Nine was enraged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more annoyed it became, the more it slurred its words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ah? What did you say? Stinky hands? Hehe, I didn't even complain about your stinky saliva! Hahaha..." Hu Bugui burst out laughing as he pointed at Little Nine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt great and he reveled in the silly dog's embarrassment, which was so unlike its usual smug and prideful self.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They carefully inspected every part of the main hall of this palace to ensure that they didn’t miss out on any treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A while later, the million-year-old soul came out of its silent reverie and secretly sent a telepathic message to him, "Alright, there's nothing here anymore. Let's continue... we don't have much time anymore and have to arrive at the gate to the Demon Domain as soon as possible."&nbsp;</span></p>
