 <p><span style>261,262 - Is she beautiful? </span></p>
 <p><span style>During this period of time, there were many merchant groups that arrived at Youyan pass.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when Qingluo company was at its peak, they may not have received a chance to enter into the Proud sky centre. But now they had completely deteriorated, the chances were even slimmer. Those important characters they once had some relations with, did not wish to have anything more to do with the Qingluo marchant company. Song Qingluo's father had already been here fox six days, and ran all around searching for people or connections but it was utterly ineffective.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Song Qingluo's father could be counted as a handsome man in Deer city, mild like jade. He was known as the elegant merchant, but after suffering such an impact, he was utterly dispirited. These days, he was in a sorry state, without any shred of his previous glamour, like a depressed old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Song Qingluo could clearly sense, that her father who was normally like a pillar in the family, her father who would not lose his composure no matter what he encounter, was currently aging at a shocking speed, weakening rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was so serious that Song Qingluo had even begun to suspect, even if they entered into Proud sky centre and saw the legendary important characters it would not be of any use.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Song family today, could no longer bring anything to the table that would attract the attention of these important characters.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her father seemed to be filled with confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it was his last shreds of confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Song Qingluo sighed in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When Master Song comes in a bit, Song Qingluo you must be courteous towards him. Don't be impulsive, even if you are a little wronged, as long as he can truly help us enter into the Proud sky centre......" Song Qingluo's father let out a sigh: "I, Song Jiannan have been eager to excel all my life......Sigh, Qingluo you must know, if it was just for me, I wouldn't make you pay such a price. But your mother, you......" </span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing her father mention her mother, in Song Qingluo's beautiful eyes, there was an unsuppressable sorrow that flashed by. </span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four months ago, when the Song family and the Qingluo merchant company was nearly in total ruins, Song Qingluo's mothers as once the number one beauty of Deer city, went to personally ask for a aid from an old acquaintance. Who could have guessed that person would have ulterior motives, wanting to possess the body of Song Qingluo's mother's body. Song Qingluo's mother did her utmost to resist, and in the end, managed to stop this from happening. But after this, she was shocked and angry, embarrassed and furious, and she was also injured from this, directly falling ill.......</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure of the entire family, fell on the young shoulders of Song Qingluo.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rest assured father, I know. As long as I can make the family continue on, I am willing to pay any price." She smiled tragically, and began cleaning her face and putting on makeup in front of the mirror. Facing the pale yellow mirror, she applied on red lipstick and power, doing her best to exhibit her most beautiful side.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a hint of tears that flashed in the eyes of Song Jiannan.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered his head, pretending he had witnessed nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world where the strongest preyed on the weak, the rule of the survival of the fittest ruled everywhere. Only true power, was the foundation for an everlasting strong position. A power of a merchant company, although it normally looked glorious and splendid, it was not like this at all in reality. In truth, such companies could collapse at any moment. Gold and status in front of true power was nothing, it could not even withstand a single strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, they had already noticed such a fact. That's why they paid such a huge sacrifice to allow Song Xiaojun and Song Qingluo to enter into the White Deer academy, wanting to change the face of the entire family. But they did not have such an opportunity, everything seemed to have come a little too late. Every martial family, were the results of generations of hard work, even tens of generations.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 15 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the sound of knocking.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Song Jiannan rubbed his own face, trying to force his frozen muscles into a shred of a smile. He went to open the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man with a powdered face entered.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Song, why are you living in such a shabby place? It's completely like the place where the poor live....." The young man seemed like to be around twenty, wearing a luxurious golden jade outfit. There was a faint hint of perfume around this body. &nbsp;He had a pointed chin, with a mole at the corner of his lips along with two or three strands of hair. He looked as vulgar as he could be. </span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We came here in a rush, and did not manage to book a decent inn. Please don't mind." Song Jiannan laughed along with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, uncle Song, you couldn't be so poor that you are only able to afford such places could you?" The young man with a pointed chin said with mockery, mercilessly exposing the &nbsp;poverty of the father and daughter pair.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Song Jiannan's face did not have the slightest trace of anger. With a smile, "How can that be, the Qingluo merchant company still have a little bit of wealth left."</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I've heard your company, is about to fall." The fan in the young man's hand moved, his gaze falling onto the Song Qingluo who was prettying herself up in the mirror. There was a bright glimmer that sparked in his eyes. Swallowing his saliva, with a laugh, "Sister Qingluo, you are becoming more and more beautiful."</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a darkness that flitted by in Song Jiannan's eyes, that was quickly hidden deep underneath.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Previously you said, that you can think of some way for us to enter into the Proud sky centre. How goes it....."</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had experienced countless treacherous experiences within the merchant world and seen all sorts of different characters. How could he know tell, just what kinds of schemes this person called Song Zhi was planning. Song Jiannan previously would not even pay attention to such a character in the past, but if a tiger entered into a city, even a dog would bully it. Since he was the one asking for a favour, he could not help but try to appease him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Song Jiannan had seen Song Zhi only once one year ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that commercial meeting, Song Zhi was part of the retinue of the number one wealthiest family, Dugu in the Phoenix province. However, during that meeting, Song Zhi's position was not high, his words and actions not drawing much favour. therefore, &nbsp;Song Jiannan did not place too much attention to this young man who had the same family name as him. However, right now the situation was completely different.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the Dugu financial organisation had also sent someone to Youyan pass, and Song Zhi was one of their followers.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of the Dugu financial organisation, they could easily obtain the right to enter into the Proud sky centre. Song Jiannan had his back pressed against &nbsp;the fall, and decided to gamble, betting on the fact that Song Zhi had some saying power within the Dugu financial organisation. On the day of the martial meeting, he would &nbsp;be able to bring them into the Proud sky centre.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as they entered into the Proud sky centre, with the items he held in his hand and with his skills in observation, he could definitely attract the attention of some important people.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the Song family could be saved.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qingluo pays her respect to uncle Song." Song Qingluo stood up, giving an elegant little curtsy.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Song Qingluo who was wearing a pale green tight fitting long dress, was like a budding little white flower. There was a powerful charm hidden within her purenes. Many years of living the life of a novility had caused her skin to be as smooth and as perfect as jade, &nbsp;and the curves of her slender waist and long legs was enogh to make someone dizzy. Her full and perfectly proportioned chest, as well as her white jade like collarbone, as well as her small face that was like a spirit.....</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Song Zhi swallowed his saliva, nearly dripping it on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his two eyes emitting light: "Ah....you can call me brother Song, I'm not that old."</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said this, he turned around and said to Song Jiannan: "That's right, uncle Song. Today the Proud sky centre is namely allocating the locations of the different merchant companies. Why don't I bring sister Qingluo to have a look, my young master will also go. This is namely a great opportunity. I will ask my young master, perhaps he will be able to help you obtain a chance to enter into the Proud sky centre."</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a shred of delight on Song Jiannan's face. "Then let's go together......"</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, uncle Song, there's no need for you to go, I'll just bring sister Qingluo with me. Us young people will be more relaxed and free on our own." Song Zhi's eyes moved about deviously, not tolerating this at all and rejecting Song Jiannan suggestion. Then he extended his arm to Song Qingluo's hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Song Qingluo subconsciously avoided him.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Song Zhi grabbed at her sleeve, then headed outsides.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Song Qingluo grinded her teeth, not saying a single word. Like a puppet, she followed him out.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you recorded it all down?"</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wen Wan finished his last bowl of lamb meat noodle. He slapped his stomach as he enquired in a completely leisurely tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bai Yuanxing next to him nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these days, he had been dragged by Wen Wan, to observe the situation at this small noodle stand. Bai Yuanxing did not train or cultivate at all in these days, and just listened and recorded whatever Wen Wan said. Everything was jsut written down, no matter how senseless or nonsensical. There were at least three or four books worth of information.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from Bai Yuanxing's perspective, the large majority of these information was useless information. Furthermore, a &nbsp;great proportion of it was just constant repetition of the same material.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, he began to believe, that Wen Wan was just looking for an excuse to sunbathe here, and was not planning on anything major.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should I continue messing about here with Officer Wen Wan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Marquis knew, and decided to punish me, what should I do?"</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Yuanxing began to want to depart.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated a few times, then finally mustered up his courage, and wanted to persuade Wen Wan to let him go.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time,</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"En?" wen Wan suddenly let out a shocked gasp. His lazy glance focused towards the entrance of the Proud sky centre.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Yuanxing's gaze followed Wen Wan's.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was unknown when, there were several well dressed young people that arrived at the entrance of the Proud sky centre. The leading person was a person with a sharp chin and a mole at his lips, looking as despicable as possible. Next to him were several disciples of the Crepe Myrtle that was guarding at the door, laughing along with him. They seemed to be discussing something.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's people of the Dugu financial company."</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Yuanxing was able to guess at their origin with one glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these days, he had already memorised the majority of the groups that entered Proud sky centre thanks to Wen Wan's unending and tireless voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that girl....."</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Yuanxing's gaze focused, he had never seen that girl before. She looked to be around fourteen or fifteen, but was extremely beautiful, like a fairy from legends. Under the tight fitting form of her pale green dress, there was a shocking beauty that made it seem like her entire body was glowing.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Yuanxing had never seen such a beautiful girl since living so long in Youyan Pass.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few more looks, Bai Yuanxing's face reddened, looking away.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be a girl from outsie the Pass. Youyan Pass is a hard place, such a beautiful girl won’t have originated from here……” Bai Yuanxing thought in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wen Wan patted Bai Yuanxing on the shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you see the girl wearing the pale green dress?” Wen Wan asked him with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Yuanxing nodded his head in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is she beautiful?” </span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Yuanxing’s face reddened. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, your face is all red…...wahahahaha, this is too damn hilarious.” Wen Wan held his stomach as he guffawed, then say meaningfully: “Bai Yuanxing, I’ll give you a chance to approach a beautiful girl. Call that girl over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Bai Yuanxing opened his mouth in shock. </span></p>
