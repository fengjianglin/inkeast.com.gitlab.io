 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 997 – Enemies Meet (1)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This person is the famous lord of Chang Ge Hall, Tan Yanzi!" Li Shengyan introduced a female Human Race Saint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We've long heard of your name at Chang Ge Hall," said a woman with a gentle and soft voice that sounded like a softly murmuring stream. She looked about thirty years of age and she was a beautiful woman with smooth and fair skin. Her teeth were like melon seeds while her skin was like cream. Her eyes were bright and lively, like moonlight reflected on clear springs. Her blue silk skirts embroidered with cloud patterns were elaborate but elegant and her hair was adorned with red agate and green jade ornaments which made her look even more graceful and noble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Greetings, Senior Tan Yanzi," Ye Qingyu said with a smile and cupped his hands in greeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, Li Shengyan introduced two more powerful Human Race seniors to Ye Qingyu and they were the master of Lightning Spirit Valley, Ye Jueqian and the master of the Towering Cliff Sect, Huang Ye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Jueqian looked around forty to fifty years of age and he was very burly with muscular limbs. His eyes were like bull’s eyes, his nose was bulbous, his face was angular and his hair was cropped short. He gave off a plucky and unrestrained air that was similar to Hu Bugui, and Ye Qingyu liked him immediately. The master of the Towering Cliff Sect, Huang Ye was a wizened old man with deep wrinkles on his forehead which seemed to be marks of time left on his face. His eyes were as cold and calm as the winter stars but his aura was much weaker than the rest and his face was slightly pale. Clearly, he had spent a lot of energy to get past the Life and Death Platform and there were still many bloodstains and injuries on his robes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu greeted them one at a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These seniors that Li Shengyan had introduced him to were all highly regarded and very influential in the Human Race. The forces and sects they belonged to were extremely rich in resources, had a long legacy and outstanding status, and were all very prestigious and reputable forces. They were considered amongst the top Human Race forces in terms of power and influence throughout the myriad domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, the Human Race experts who were with Li Shengyan had definitely received the approval of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] and were the true cornerstones of the Human Race sects throughout the Vast Thousand Domains today. Li Shengyan had confidently introduced him to them because they were people whom he could trust and depend on and were completely different from people like the Greater One Spiritual Master and Thousand Illusion Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was well aware of that fact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These Human Race experts were also aware of Ye Qingyu's reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's feats of battle along the Road of Chaos were unparalleled and outstanding and now that he was promoted to become the Third Deputy Spokesperson of the Human Race, his current status, strength, and cultivation were very impressive. Furthermore, he was someone who had received the recognition of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei], so they spoke to him as though he was their peer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After they were all introduced to each other, they started speaking casually amongst themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who had made it this far were all the top experts and the forces they represented could not be underestimated. They also each had their own motives for coming to the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor but after chatting with them for a while, Ye Qingyu looked a little distracted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He kept looking back at the group of people who were waiting behind, as though he was searching for something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, more and more people continually arrived at the bone platform through the path of bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu grew a little anxious and would often look backward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, what are you looking for?" Li Shengyan asked as he followed his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Fatty, since you were here earlier than I was, did you happen to see a boorish Human Race man who is tall and bearded, clad in clothes that are full of mended patches, and a… small white dog?" Ye Qingyu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-year-old soul had made multiple guarantees but he still worried about the safety of Hu Bugui and Little Nine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they hadn’t encountered any danger, Hu Bugui and Little Nine should have arrived at the bone platform by this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other passengers on the same boat, including the Four Stars holy girl, Thousand Illusion Elder and Orchid Saintess, were all absent too. He didn't know whether they were dead or alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Boorish bearded man? A small white dog?" Li Shengyan scratched his bald head and shook his head. "All the Human Race experts who have made it to the mountains of bones are all here. I didn’t see the boorish man you mentioned. As for the small white dog, I don't think I've seen it either. Are they your friends who undertook this journey with you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Hu Bugui and Little Nine shouldn't have met with danger but they might not necessarily come here. They would probably each have another chance waiting for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Shengyan was surprised when he saw how anxious Ye Qingyu was, then he turned to the other Human Races and foreign races to ask around. After he returned, he said, "Brother, no one has seen the man and dog you mentioned earlier. I don't think they've arrived here yet."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone throughout the Vast Thousand Domains knew that Li Shengyan was a descendant of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] and could be considered the spokesperson of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]. Therefore, they would treat him with respect and were probably telling the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu could only let this matter slide for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He shook his head to rid himself of all distracting thoughts and carefully observed his surroundings. Then he said, "Since everyone has gathered here, what are we waiting for?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Shengyan laughed and said conspiratorially, "Look in front of you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was slightly stunned, then he looked ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was nothing below the bone platform and demon qi swirled like a sea of clouds. Approximately around a thousand meters from the 'sea of clouds' was a huge black gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had been too distracted earlier. He had greeted Li Shengyan and worried about the safety of Hu Bugui and Little Nine, so he failed to notice the existence of this gate. When he spotted it earlier in his peripheral vision, he had assumed it was a black mountain range. Upon taking a closer look, he was shocked to discover that it was a huge black gate that was tens of thousands of meters tall and looked as though it had been standing there for ages. It was as black as ink and the more he looked at it, the more it seemed like the end of the world. It blocked out everything ahead of him and he didn't realize it initially but the more he looked, the more alarmed he was since it seemed like all he could see in front of him was this gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu shook his head and looked away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He recognized the obstruction as some kind of power of laws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This gate stopped them all from entering another world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this gate didn't open, no one could enter the other world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a terrifying act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He finally understood why all these experts were waiting idly around instead of moving forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason was simple -</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He just couldn't go back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This gate blocked everyone else's path</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He guessed that even if a Quasi-emperor was present, he would also be unable to walk past the gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He he he, as you can see, there is a huge gate ahead of you and even Immortals might not be able to leap past it. Therefore, everyone was forced to wait outside. There were rumors earlier that this gate is the legendary Gate to the Demon Domain. We’re now all waiting for the fog to dissipate, then the gates will automatically open and we would be able to step into the true heart of the Reincarnation Hall."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"True heart of the Reincarnation Hall?" Ye Qingyu said as realization dawned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, was he saying that the tests that they had encountered along the way, including the various divine temples and treasures at the maze corridors were all not the true heart of the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Shengyan looked as though he was very well-informed and continued sagely, "He he, I bet you didn't know this but not anybody would be able to have the chance to encounter the true works of the Chaos Demon Emperor. The palaces and tests you've been through earlier were all designed by the Chaos Demon Emperor to weed out the useless beings who aren't qualified to enter the Gate to the Demon Domain. When I arrived here earlier, I heard from several seniors that this door is about to open anytime soon."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He finally understood that whatever Hu Bugui, Little Nine and himself had encountered earlier were all tests designed by the Chaos Demon Emperor. They would only have the opportunity to encounter the legendary true opportunities and chance of become Emperor if they managed to make it this far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He thought for a moment before he asked, "What lies behind the Gate to the Demon Domain?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu knew that Li Shengyan had probably gathered a lot of information based on his tendency to observe and listen carefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Li Shengyan could answer smugly, the successor of Lightning Spirit Valley, Ye Jueqian suddenly said solemnly, "There are many rumors as to what lies behind the Gate to the Demon Domain. Some say that there are ultimate treasures while others say that there are chances and opportunities. It was also rumored that the Demon Emperor Reincarnation Demon Scriptures that lie behind those gates are the records of the mysterious techniques used by the Chaos Demon Emperor to reincarnate as well as the profound mysteries of his ninety-nine reincarnations. It is an authentic ancient relic and an Emperor's Scriptures that contain the knowledge gleaned from his completion of the martial way. The Quasi-emperors who have entered the Reincarnation Hall this time are all after these scriptures."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demon Emperor Reincarnation Demon Scriptures?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was his first time hearing of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Could the rumored chance to become Emperor be referring to this set of Demon Scriptures?" Ye Qingyu asked casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The seniors beside him shook their heads, as though they weren't certain either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only exception was Li Shengyan who shook his head with certainty and his fat cheeks also jiggled as he moved. He said seriously, "That's not true. The mysterious technique within the Demon Scriptures is the emperor's road records of the Chaos Demon Emperor. It could be considered the ultimate treasure in this universe and the legacy of his emperor's road is matchless. However, it can't be used as a chance to become emperor since if the future generations tread down the same path as the previous owner of this legacy, they would only become a Quasi-emperor at best since they are just parroting the actions of others. Historically, every Emperor of the martial way had forged their own path and not become Emperors through the legacy of others. Secondly, the Quasi-emperor’s who are present here come with their own individual legacies and martial ways that have been refined to perfection over time and experience. They can't possibly destroy their Quasi-emperor cultivation to start from the very beginning because of the contents of the Demon Scripture. Therefore, I can conclude that the so-called chance to become an Emperor isn't the Demon Scriptures."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu nodded as though realization had just dawned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words had almost exactly mirrored the million-year-old soul's words at the Greater One Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu knew that Li Shengyan had probably heard this news from [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like the zone behind the Gate to the Demon Domain seemed to contain many divine treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides the Demon Scriptures, the Immortal Body that the million-year-old soul had mentioned was probably inside too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu speculated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Looking at the time, the demon qi fog should dissipate soon. I guess the Gate to the Demon Domain is about to open," Li Shengyan sounded a little excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tan Yanzi and the rest were also a little restless after spending such a long time staring at the gate since they arrived on the bone platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they spoke, there was a movement down below on the path of bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A figure clad in black Daoist robes slowly walked along the path of bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu casually turned to look at the newcomer and his eyes immediately hardened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Greater One Spiritual Master.&nbsp;</span></p>
