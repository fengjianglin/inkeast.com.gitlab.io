He had seen countless experts, but never a Saint-level existence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment the dark green figure in the Void that spoke was exuding an aura that was too powerful. The fluctuation of power around him contained the power of heaven. Although he was clearly situated in this world, he seemed to be in his own domain, very different from the surroundings and extremely bizarre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the description on some ancient records, experts with that kind of aura were sure to have knocked on the Immortal gate, transcended from worldliness, and entered the boundary of Saints.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had overcome all worldly thoughts and entered Sainthood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu did not think that the storm on Taowu Mountain Range would attract Saint-level experts. Before the dark green flame light figure spoke, it had not caught Ye Qingyu's attention. But now the more he looked at the figure, the more frightened he was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That person is a guardian elder of the Jade Pearl Sect, a thousand-year-old monster, but that old monster is not the most terrifying. Do you see the woman next to him? She is the Saintess of Jade Pearl, a ruthless woman,” Fatty Shen Yan uttered in hushed tones to Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He lowered his voice to one that was very quiet, and there was a strong grudging tone in his words, as if he had suffered personally in the hands of the Jade Pearl Saintess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu cast a glance at this and followed his gaze. Sure enough, next to the dark green suspected Saint-level expert there was a graceful and curved figure of a woman. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman was dressed in a pure and snow-white long dress, without the slightest impurity or dirt on it, and a jade green sword scabbard hung at her slender waist. Her long black hair was draped over her back like a flowing waterfall, down to the calf, and her face was covered with a white gauzy cloth. Vaguely her strikingly beautiful face could be seen under the gauze, adding a more elegant and mysterious air. Her exposed ear and neck were as soft and fair as white jade. She was a real beauty with flesh of ice and bones of jade, untainted by even a speck of dust, radiated an elegant demeanour and without the slightest flaw.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman stood in mid-air with her white dress swaying gently. Her black hair was glistening, which exuded &nbsp;an indescribable elegance, like a fairy of the winter palace, aloof from the world and extremely cold and lofty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Saintess of Jade Pearl really is of unparalleled manner and beauty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu was also astonished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That moment of astonishment sent Ye Qingyu's heart rippling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman, whether in appearance or temperament, was indeed worthy of being called Saintess. Even the peerless geniuses painstakingly cultivated by the Jade Pearl Sect, including the dark green flame martial Saint, evidently also could not take away the slightest of brilliance from her. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My Sinful Pit wants one of the six Doors of Life,” another voice sounded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person who spoke was a youngster who looked to be in his teens, clad in a large black robe, with his yellowish disheveled hair draped across his shoulders, and did not seem to care about his appearance. His figure was skinny and his arms were crossed at his chest. His fingers were as dark as a bird's claw, and the smile on his face seemed to be full of ridicule and disdain for the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind the youngster was a blood red brilliance, inside of which could vaguely be seen a tall and thin figure. Although the appearance was unclear, the aura exuded was not in the slightest inferior to the Saint of the Jade Pearl Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit, the blood-coloured shadows behind him are his guardians, and also the people in charge of the Sinful Pit. These two guys are crazy. It's best not to mess with them.” The bald fatty Sheng Yan moved closer again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You seem like you know everything?” Ye Qingyu glanced at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty smiled, and spoke without modesty, “That is true, nothing can hide from me....”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you?” Ye Qingyu casually asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fatty was about to answer then suddenly reacted and his tone changed all of a sudden, “Big brother, you’re trying to find out something from me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is there something you can't say to anyone?” Ye Qingyu shot a glance at him, then his eyes shifted and quietly continued watching the groups of people around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition to the people of the Jade Pearl Sect and the Sinful Pit, there were several other forces that occupied an absolute advantageous position on the Fierce Beast Peak from the Doors of Darkness, among them Lu Li and Yang Wanqu were also present.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sheng Yan saw that Ye Qingyu did not pay any attention to him, smiled, and came closer again. “You are looking at Tian Gian Sect's Lu Li and the Black Moon Palace's Yang Wanqu. You do not have to worry about these two trashes. They can't set off any waves. Their strength is not good enough. They were chased by the Celestial Phoenix Maiden like dogs and were almost killed. At the last moment, the Third Prince of the Kaiyang Imperial Court saved both of them since they were acquaintances.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze swept across Lu Li and Yang Wanqu and stopped at a tall, burly young man standing in front of the two. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man's face was like copper, eyes bright as stars and eyebrows like swords that reached his temples. His whole body was protected by a golden battle armour, which was marked with sun formation seals. The rays of light were so bright that it was like the scorching sun and could not be looked at from a close distance. He wore a golden dragon helmet and golden battle boots, and two golden double-pointed coiled dragon spears were slung across his back. His appearance and manner of dressing was like a martial arts general from a story, emitting a flame-like aura all over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden sun-armoured youngster presumably was the Third Prince of the Kaiyang Imperial Court who killed the three great elders of the Quicksand Valley.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He really was a peerless genius of his generation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And thousands of meters left of the Third Prince of the Kaiyang Imperial Court, there was a tall, slender female war goddess, bathed in purple flames, standing opposite him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a mysterious woman. Clad in a purple gold Phoenix battle outfit, and with a Phoenix mask covering her face. She possessed a unique and powerful aura that was completely opposite of the pure and cold aura of the Saintess of Jade Pearl. She was like an unsheathed divine sword, radiating that wild and powerful aura to its fullest and without restraint.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of all, the Phoenix mask on her face was glowing with a kind of evil brilliance, like a real living Phoenix face, concealing her power. It made others unable to see through and understand her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without the need to guess, Ye Qingyu already knew that the female war goddess was the legendary Celestial Phoenix Maiden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another strong and headstrong peerless talent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And behind the Celestial Phoenix Maiden, there was a ball of purple flames half a meter in diameter that was blazing, revealing an aura that was comparable to that of the guardians of the Sinful Pit and the Jade Pearl Sect. Evidently it was another important figure. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, Ye Qingyu also saw the people of the Black Demon Abyss. A number of Black Demon Abyss elders were surrounding a little girl who looked only twelve or thirteen years old. She must be the legendary Little Princess of the Black Demon Race. &nbsp;</span></p>

He was another Saint-level expert, exuding an aura that was as powerful and majestic as the stars of the Ninth Heaven.&nbsp;</span></p>

His face was fair and clear, eyes narrow and long, brows thick like swords, and he was clad in a bright yellow armour. With an icy cold expression on his face he was looking straight at the dark Doors of Life in the sky, seemingly unconcerned with what was happening around him.</span></p>

In other words, only eighteen people could pass through the six dark Doors of Life. As a result, these major forces were bargaining and fighting for their places.</span></p>

His blood sprayed across the sky and he was eliminated right away.&nbsp;</span></p>

But they also dared not to say a word.</span></p>

If he were to go against them, then there was no difference to throwing away his life. He had no choice but to think of other ways.&nbsp;</span></p>

There is no need to be impatient. The most important thing now is the great opportunity before you, if you and I join forces...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu interrupted him, “Because what I lack most right now is time.” &nbsp;</span></p>

Each Door of Darkness had become gentler.&nbsp;</span></p>

With his strength, was he thinking of entering one of the doors? The most likely outcome of that course of action was that before he even came near one, he would be torn apart by the experts of the major forces.&nbsp;</span></p>
