 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, the fragrant scent filled the entire hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"These are indeed divine pills!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui took one look and immediately cried out jubilantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu also nodded his head in excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was great!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These pill furnaces truly contained divine pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Based on their appearance and the scent they emitted, these pills were definitely peerless medicinal pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu reached out to collect them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, a bright white light pounced toward the pill furnace from behind them with its mouth wide open. It curled its tongue and more than a dozen light purple pills were sucked into its stomach. He chewed them loudly like large beans and swallowed them all. A fragrant scent wafted from his mouth and an abundant yuan essence aura burst forth from the medicinal pills that it crushed between its teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Little Nine!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Silly dog!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui both exclaimed in horror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Woof! Ha ha ha!" Silly dog Little Nine stood next to the pill furnace after it pulled off its sneak attack and chewed the divine pills with all its might. After it swallowed them in one mouthful, it shot them a smug smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had already formulated this plan earlier and had lain in wait for the right moment to snatch those pills the moment the lid of the pill furnace was opened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Woof… obviously, only a divine dog like myself would be worthy of eating these divine pills, ha ha ha. Human, you are too foolish!" Then, its eyes turned furtively and it suddenly turned to charge toward the black lotus plate once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this time Ye Qingyu caught it in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Little Nine." He reached out to grab it by its neck and hauled it away from the lotus plate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This dog was simply recklessly wasting these divine pills. It even swallowed so many of those pills in one shot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, they had yet to figure out what exactly were the effects of these pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui quickly carefully collected the remaining ninety over pills with an indignant look on his face. He looked at the silly dog disdainfully and yelled, "You… I can't believe these divine pills of the highest quality were used to feed a dog! It is practically a crime that these pills were wasted and you still swallowed them all. Those pills are totally wasted on you!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was also dumbfounded and casually flung Little Nine aside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He should have known this silly dog would harbor designs on the pills. What a waste of those good pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Nineg leaned against the legs of the pill furnace. It wasn't angry but shot a proud sidelong glance at the both of them as it retorted, "What do you mean by saying those pills are wasted on me? Ah? Chief bandit, what are you trying to say? Woof, I'm a divine dog too so these pills were meant for me. You are the one who isn't worthy of these pills. Ha ha ha, those who make the first move will be at a advantage. He he, these pills are extremely potent. Ha ha ha, I can feel a surge of warm qi flowing from my stomach to my head. Woof, I'm about to become an Immortal, ha ha ha ha…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was extremely excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui gnashed his teeth in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, something odd happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Nine's eyes suddenly darkened and its body stiffened. Its limbs started to twitch uncontrollably and mouthfuls of white foam frothed from its mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Uh… why do I feel like my entire body is going numb? Am I really going to become an Immortal? Uh… I can't move anymore… Boo hoo hoo," before it could finish his sentence, its face filled with surprise as the realization hit it. Its eyes widened and it foamed madly from its mouth. It froze on the spot as though it had been fossilized, just like it was dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was happening?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu and Hu Bugui were astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was Little Nine trying to trick them again?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its acting was far too realistic for it to be pretending. They clearly sensed that there was no energy wave emitting from Little Nine at all and even his life force had disappeared. It was definitely not putting on an act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was also shocked and quickly went to check on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he touched it, he realized that Little Nine's body was still warm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his palm pressed against its stomach, he could clearly feel its heartbeat. He placed his hand under the dog's nose and could also feel it breathing. It seemed like Little Nine was still alive and it wasn't dead yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon closer observation, he noticed that Little Nine's eyes were still turning around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clearly conscious and in a state of panic, but for some reason, it was unable to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu thought it was extremely odd that Little Nine's vital signs had completely disappeared and he didn't show any signs of life. If he didn't touch it but instead observed it with his divine sense or his naked eyes, he would have definitely thought that Little Nine was dead for it was no different from a rock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was really strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Could those Immortal pills be poisoned?" Hu Bugui said uncertainly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't think so," Ye Qingyu said as he shook his head. "No one knows how long these pill furnaces have been at [Tusita Palace] and their seal looked as though it was from the Fiendgod Age, so if these pills were indeed poisoned, Little Nine would have already lost its life…" Ye Qingyu said as he took a purple Immortal pill from Hu Bugui's hand and examined it carefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was also extremely knowledgeable when it came to the art of alchemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moments later—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This isn't a poison pill and there's no poison in it," Ye Qingyu said confidently. "It contains a shocking power and shreds of the power of laws. It does indeed look like the work of the god of alchemy back then. Medicinal pills are categorized into medicinal pills, spiritual pills and divine pills. These pills are definitely divine pills but I'm still not sure what exactly its effects are."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui breathed a sigh of relief at Ye Qingyu's words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had always been bickering with Little Nine, he still thought of it as his friend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu dug out a jade bottle and split the remaining pills into four portions. The first three portions were the same but the fourth portion was slightly lesser than the previous three. Then he said, "We've entered this place together with brother Nan Tieyi and this dog so we will split all the treasures we've obtained by four. Since this silly dog had already eaten seventeen pills earlier, it will receive a smaller portion of these pills and I'll keep brother Nan Tieyi's pills on his behalf. What do you think of this, brother Hu Bugui?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui was stunned and said, "This… is too much. All I've done was to follow you and I didn't even do anything. Three pills will be enough for me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled and didn’t make any further explanations as he passed Hu Bugui's portion to him, "Please don't stand on ceremony, brother Hu Bugui."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui couldn’t dissuade him, so he accepted the pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hm, the pills within this pill furnace are a little odd. They contain the essence of the laws but there are obvious side-effects after ingesting them. Um, I'll name them Deathlike Pills. One will fall into a deathlike coma after ingesting them which is a strange effect but if taken well, it might even produce miraculous effects," Ye Qingyu said contemplatively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He placed the stiff silly dog on his shoulder, then continued to observe the other pill furnaces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He quickly followed his earlier example and employed the occult technique engraved within the one hundred eight ancient characters on the [Cloud Top Cauldron] to break the seal and open another pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This pill furnace was slightly bigger than the pill furnace he opened earlier but it contained fewer pills. There were approximately sixty pills and each pill was as big as a longan. They were dark green in color just like round pearls carved from jade and they were so shiny that he could see his reflection. There were markings inside those pills that resembled Bodhi trees and they looked extremely beautiful. Every single pill emitted abundant life energy, as though it was alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It is as green as jade and its life energy as abundant as the ocean. The pills within this pill furnace seem to be divine pills that could replenish one's energy," Ye Qingyu mused after carefully examining them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui was full of smiles as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after what had happened to Little Nine earlier, they didn't dare to eat those pills recklessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Nine's body was still frozen stiff and it lay prone on Ye Qingyu's shoulder but its eyes roved hungrily as it stared at those dark green divine pills. Unfortunately, it wasn't able to eat those pills and saliva dripped from its mouth. It regretted its earlier decision to eat those Deathlike Pills. Now that he was in this frozen and deathlike state, it couldn't eat anything at all but could only stare helplessly at those pills and it was consumed with remorse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu ignored the silly dog and divided these pills into four portions, just as he did earlier. Then, he handed Hu Bugui one portion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He then continued to open the other pill furnaces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, thirty minutes had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had opened six consecutive pill furnaces and found pills of a variety of colors and auras. The things these pills had in common was that all these pills exuded abundant Immortal qi and emitted a fragrant scent that refreshed one's senses. One whiff of this fragrance was enough to make both of them feel refreshed and energetic. Their inner yuan flowed even more smoothly and their yuan qi had also visibly increased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha ha…"Hu Bugui was beaming brightly. He was so elated that he could no longer speak but merely laughed foolishly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had to take a short break.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, he had to utilize the occult technique from the one hundred eight ancient characters consistently, so it had taken a considerable strain on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moments later—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu opened the ninth pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the largest pill furnace amongst those that he had opened thus far and the moment the lid lifted, a crimson red divine radiance shot out from it. This red flowing light flew in all directions from this pill furnace toward the depths of the Bagua Formation…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh no." Hu Bugui was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, Ye Qingyu had been prepared. His body flashed, then he captured this red radiance in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light in his hand burned like hot coals but on a closer look, he saw that it was a round pill that was as red as fire. Its outer layer swirled with flames and clouds as though it was delicately carved with a thin pen, and it seemed hollow inside. He could vaguely make out red flames that roared brightly within it. It was extremely magical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is the finished product of a divine pill."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was stunned for a moment, then exhilaration washed over him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the pills that he had obtained from the earlier eight pill furnaces were also divine pills of varying shapes, colors and auras, they were considered lower grade divine pills because they merely contained shreds of the power of laws. However, the power of laws contained within this fiery red medicinal pill was very much complete. It was truly the finished product of a divine pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red flames beneath the outer layer of this medicinal pill were the complete laws of fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pill master who refined this pill must have been extremely remarkable to be able to refine the laws of flames and contain them within this pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This pill would be the ultimate tonic to any expert who cultivated fire style martial arts techniques. It could even be considered a most precious treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu who was a pill master himself knew that the true potential of this fiery divine pill didn't lie in ingesting it but its potential lay in battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, it could be used in battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who weren't familiar with alchemy would assume that all medicinal pills were meant for consumption but they didn't know that there was a type of divine pill that was different from the ordinary divine pills. They contained the concentrated essence of laws and could be used as divine weapons to become precious battle treasures. A true master alchemist merely needed to possess some pill controlling secret technique to be able to activate this fiery divine pill and utilize its laws of fire to kill the enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the true mystery behind the divine pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fiery divine pill in his hand was a battle divine pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, it was the only one of its kind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu looked at Hu Bugui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui got a fright and immediately waved his hands. "Don't look at me, I don't want that… there's only one divine pill so it should be yours. I've already gained loads from following you so it'd be inhumane if I continued extracting treasures from you. Even if you give it to me, I wouldn't be shameless enough to accept it… It's yours, it's yours. Take it. To be honest, I prefer the process of hunting for treasure as compared to obtaining the actual treasure itself. It's exciting and risky! Ha ha ha!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Hu Bugui was right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if he gave this fiery battle divine pill to Hu Bugui, he would not be able to wield it to its fullest potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Ye Qingyu did not argue any further and kept this divine pill for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He still hadn't found the technique to control this fiery battle divine pill but from his discoveries earlier, he believed that the answer would lie within the occult techniques of the one hundred eight ancient characters. He had always felt that this [Cloud Top Cauldron] was way too mysterious and contained huge secrets. Just this one hundred eight ancient characters occult technique would be enough to perform miraculous feats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hm? There are other things within this pill furnace…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui peered into the ninth pill furnace and discovered something new. He reached inside and dug out some residue out of curiosity. The residue he dug out were like wood shavings. They were slightly damp and emitted a mysterious fragrance. They were crimson red in color with rich fire power. The moment he dug these residues out of the pill furnace, abundant energy surged like the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was elated when he saw that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is the residue from the pill refining process. They still contain their divine properties and are definitely considered treasures. They make great tonics with the ability to affect one's cultivation and are comparable to divine-level origin crystals," he said with a smile. "Brother Hu Bugui, you may take the divine residue. I'm sure you'll put them to good use."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright!" Hu Bugui didn't stand on ceremony this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He reached out to continue digging out the residue from the pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just then ——</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A ray of flowing light that was full of killing intent charged toward them and completely shrouded Hu Bugui within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu turned pale, "Watch out…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone had launched a sneak attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu hastily raised his hand to catch the flowing light with his bare hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"am!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a muffled sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flowing light exploded Ye Qingyu's palm to reveal a yuan qi dagger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hm?" There was a shocked exclamation from the entrance of the main hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the door to the main hall opened and a group of people entered the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their leader was a young and handsome man with an arrogant attitude. His eyes were filled with unmistakable contempt and disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the young man who had arrogantly proclaimed that Ye Qingyu was not fit to enter the Reincarnation Hall before the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor descended and also declared that he would kill Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">it was truly a small world – one just had to run into the enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had met here again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I can't believe both of you useless beings managed to find the [Tusita Palace]. That was just dumb luck. Sadly, it would end right now. I proclaim that everything within this place is now mine. Ha ha ha, I see that nine pill furnaces have been opened. You must have taken the treasures within it, right? Hand them over right now. My patience is limited," the young man said with a cold smile as he crossed his arms over his chest. He looked extremely confident and he said disdainfully, "After you hand over the treasures you have obtained, go ahead and commit suicide. I'll leave your bodies whole out of goodwill, otherwise… ha ha!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, the twenty or thirty men behind him quietly fanned out to seal all routes of escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye QIngyu and Hu Bugui were completely surrounded.&nbsp;</span></p>
