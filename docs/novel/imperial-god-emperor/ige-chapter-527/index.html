 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu, seeing that Inspiration King had understood his meaning, nodded. “Since it is the Dao sound that the Lightning Emperor his highness had left behind, it is a precious opportunity. Back then the Lightning Emperor had fought for the lives of the Human Race, and rescued the entire race from an adverse situation. He is known as the father of the Human Race, but unfortunately he later disappeared. He had not handed down his teachings, and this Dao sound might be his last gift to the younger generation of the Human Race. If only I listened to it by myself it would be a waste. If there is a suitable time, when all sincere elites of the Human Race can gather together to listen to the Dao sound, then would that not achieve the best result for the Dao sound, isn’t that better?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Inspiration King heard this, he was shocked for a long while, not saying a word.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course, the premise is that, when the Lightning Emperor left this Dao sound, he did not request only one person to hear it.” Ye Qingyu added. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, Old Fish Inspiration King finally snapped out of his trace, sighing deeply, “You boy, I admire you. You have both aspiration and courage, if others got the chance to hear the Dao sound of the Lightning Emperor, they most likely will be afraid of others finding out and will find the safest corner to listen by themselves, and may not even let the ones closest to them know.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu grinned and did not speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a moment.&nbsp;</span></p>

No wonder that you could enter this place unimpeded. The previous people, although their aptitudes can indeed be called incomparable and their strengths were many times stronger than you, were obstructed from entering this stone room by the power of thunder and unable to step into this room by the slightest of inches.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was such a thing?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was not the reason?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will save Elder first.” Ye Qingyu came closer to the Dragon Wood bucket, asking cautiously, “I only need to fish you up from the bucket, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Well...” Old Fish reddened with shame, “That’s right, but...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But what?” Ye Qingyu was puzzled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Old Fish explained awkwardly. “But my plan before was to wait until you pulled me out from the Dragon Wood bucket then immediately knock you out. Then leave this place and slowly find ways to recover my Dao injury. In this stone room there should be three barrels of pure Yuan thunder liquid, which can sustain me for some time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that this cunning Old Fish did not have any good intentions before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now that he had told him, there was no need to be embarrassed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu stooped down, stretching his hand into the Dragon Seizing Wooden bucket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His fingers had only reached into the bucket, when immediately there was a numbness in his fingertips, like an electric shock. Luckily he was able to tolerate it completely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be careful, this bucket is filled with the will of the Lightning Emperor,” the Old Fish reminded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Ye Qingyu finally was still able to grab the fin of Old Fish and smoothly and slowly pulled him out of the Dragon Seizing Wooden bucket.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!&nbsp;</span></p>

There was a flash of light in the dark stone room and an old man with straw-like hair appeared out of thin air before him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man’s hair was grey and dry, and his skin shriveled up like air-dried orange peels. He had a set of yellow teeth, and was dressed in a yellow cloth robe. His waist was slightly crooked, his beard was hanging down almost to his waist, jet black and shiny, extremely elegant, but his eyes were crossed, and had an indescribable wretched expression. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ha ha, millions of years, I am finally free.” The old man leaped excitedly, like an old monkey, somersaulting, unable to contain his excitement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu watched silently at the side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This cross-eyed wretched old man was obviously transformed from the bright carp in the bucket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This guy that was known to control the chaotic Quicksand Xea, just where was that graceful demeanor of the King of all Aquatic Race? He was more like a conman that squats at the side street telling fortune. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, boy, thank you for saving me, I am destined not to die. If you had come a century later, I really would have died in this bucket.” Inspiration King, after calming himself down, turned around to grasp Ye Qingyu’s hand for a handshake, then very carefully sorted his long beard, grumbling, “Qin Ming, this guy, is too unreliable. He disappeared for millions of years without any signs, I almost died inside this broken bucket.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Listening to him cursing the God-like Lightning Emperor to the Human Race, Ye Qingyu did not know whether to laugh or cry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Yes, elder, you said before that you were tricked so you entered into the bucket, why would you blame the Lightning Emperor His Highness?” Ye Qingyu asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Old Fish nodded. “Ah, yes, this Dragon Seizing Wood is the nemesis of the Human Race. Back then when I was betrayed, my powers were destroyed by the Dragon Seizing Wood, and my soul was almost annihilated. The Lightning Emperor helped me retain my body and a wisp of my soul. As they say, whoever started the trouble should end it. With his ability he placed me into the Dragon Seizing Wooden bucket and used lightning liquid to suppress the fierce nature of the wood. This saved my life, but my injuries were too severe, so I was unable to accompany him and the other brothers to battle against the fiendgods. I planned to wait for their triumphant return, to celebrate this new world together, who would have known that…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he was speaking, his wretched face really revealed a strong sorrowful colour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu also did not know what to say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Fish continued, “The Lightning Emperor controls destiny, he is the strongest person of the heaven and earth. Logically speaking, no matter the result, he should not have disappeared, what happened back then... I must find out, I do not believe that the martial arts emperor on earth, and so many brothers with earth-shattering powers would really be gone like that, I must find them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The whereabouts of the Lightning Emperor was a historical puzzle.&nbsp;</span></p>

Some things, I have to think about carefully.”&nbsp;</span></p>

I only need one drop per month, they now have little significance on my Dao injury.” Old Fish suddenly remembered something, added, “You have learned the basics of [Ultimate Lightning Entitlement], you can try activating the force of Lightning. This chaotic thunder liquid is the purest lightning power in the world, you can try to absorb and refine them gradually, and establish the strongest foundation. This is a great opportunity, if it was not for the fact that I am not really a human, I really want to destroy my foundation, to cultivate the remarkable powers of Lightning.”&nbsp;</span></p>

But Old Fish had very modestly expressed that his Dao injury had not healed and was unable to fight for a long period of time. Or else it would aggravate his Dao injury, causing him to be annihilated, so he could not help Demon King Ye and Demon King Ye must rely on himself.</span></p>

By the time Ye Qingyu really mastered the power of this little drop, he may even injure Heaven Ascension stage experts and even Immortal stage experts. Of course, the premise was that Ye Qingyu must be able to come near such experts. &nbsp;</span></p>
