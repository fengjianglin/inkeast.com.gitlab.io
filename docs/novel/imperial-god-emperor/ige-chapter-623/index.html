The old man’s forehead was plump and his face was radiant. His pair of white brows was long and reaching to the temples. His eyes, slightly raised, were as imposing as the glaring eyes of the guardian deity of an old Buddhist temple deep in the mountains. As he moved there was a rumbling of thunder along with the fluttering of his clothes.</span></p>

His eyes were bright, his brows sparse and his silver hair was bunched at the top of his head secured with a jade hairpin. His thin face had been left with the traces of age, with deep lines of wrinkles deeply engraved across his forehead and outer corner of his eyes. With a faint smile on his face, his aura was calm and gentle, as amiable as the kind old man next door. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man on the right wore a black robe, and his stature was half a head taller than the green-robe elder next to him. His long grey hair hung over his back, his face was as angular as a knife and his eyes had eagle eye-like sharpness. Although he showed no expression on his face, his aura was like a million-year-old iceberg, as though telling others not to come near and almost making the air solidify.</span></p>

They had unsurpassed authority and power, but never cared about secular affairs and only focused on cultivation. If it were not for the fact that the Human Race was in a crisis, they certainly would not have left the mountains.&nbsp;</span></p>

He immediately realized something, and hurriedly introduced them, “Seniors, they are the three great elders of the Immortal God Emperor Sect. This is Elder Li in charge of the Martial Arts Hall, in the middle is Elder Mo in charge of the Repository of Buddhist Texts, and on the right is Elder Xie of the Monastic Discipline Hall.”&nbsp;</span></p>

The crisis of Flowing Light City was reversed because these two seniors appeared at the critical moment, and the hundreds of thousands of people of Flowing Light City were saved as a result.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Opposite.&nbsp;</span></p>

Tianhang? In the rumours, the one who severed Devouring Heaven in one sword strike, killed the black spider twins within seconds, and transformed into a dragon to destroy the Demon Spider Prince Mojin into ashes, and the saviour who shook the Demon Spider Race with three swords, is you?” The Martial Arts Hall Elder Li looked at Ye Qingyu, not expecting the legendary person to be this young, his eyes flashing with a trace of amazement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the two other elders also fell on Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>

His image and strength was a little inconsistent to the mysterious master in their mind, who had successively destroyed the Demon Spiders and whose name had resounded through Clear River Domain.</span></p>

In particular, the mister storytellers in the teashop, every one of them was performing how you saved the people at the ruins of the City Lord’s residence and how you killed the Demon Spider Prince by yourself with beautiful songs and rich emotions. Even the scene of the Demon Spider Race fleeing was described particularly wonderfully.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not only that, the shadow puppet stage at the end of the street was crowded with both adults and children, it was playing how you defeated the generals of the Demon Spider Race. It was vivid and realistic, like the scene was recreated.”&nbsp;</span></p>

His name had spread all over Clear River Domain. In particular, the tale of the three swords that shook Demon Spiders had created an uproar in Clear River Domain.” The eyes of Elder Mo of the Repository of Buddhist Texts flickered with a trace of appreciation as he remarked, smiling. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Correct, the news had been spread out long ago. The matters that happened in the city have already been heard by many major forces. Now, the Human Race and foreign races in the Clear River Domain all know about the legendary person who emerged in Flowing Light City.” Elder Xie of the Monastic Discipline Hall nodded lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To cause such a huge stir in Clear River Domain in such a short time, I thought this Tianhang must be a hidden old monster, who couldn’t stand aside and not save the desperate crisis. I did not think that...” The Martial Arts Hall Elder Li paused and did not continue, but what he meant was obviously that he did not expect Tianhang, whose name had spread across Clear River Domain, to be such a young man. &nbsp;“</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To tell the truth, many forces are already beginning to guess the background of Tianhang, and all kinds of rumors have emerged. There are different opinions and some are quite strange. Some said that he was born from a rock, some said he emerged from a beam of white light in the sky, some said he was born from the sky and some said he is the reincarnation of the divine dragon... There are many stories,” &nbsp;a handsome young man in an ice blue silk robe embroidered with elegant bamboo leaves, who stood behind the Elder of the Reposotiry of Buddhist Texts, &nbsp;said smilingly. He was recalling all the bizarre rumours that made him clutch his belly with both hands along the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, in the past hundreds of years, there have been many legendary people in Clear River Domain, but I have never heard of a person called Tianhang. When such a peerless master suddenly appeared, the major forces were all startled. All of the people and Demon Races were naturally very curious. Most likely that many people are now secretly investigating and finding out about Tianhang’s background.” Elder Mo smiled slightly.</span></p>
