One arrow turned into two, two arrows turned into four, the arrow behind touching the arrow in front, the arrow to the left touching the arrow to the right. The trajectories and path of the arrows completely changed, as if it was living. There was no way of leaving, as if all the escape routes of the jade-faced scholar had been completely sealed off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally.</span></p>

Like a hedgehog, his body fell downwards towards the ground from the skies.</span></p>

This fatty that seemed stupid and clumsy previously had only defended and not attacked, not because his strength was not enough, but he was observing into the intricacies of his foot techniques. The fatty had seen through it, and laid out a situation where he would definitely die by his arrows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Haha, I hit him, I hit him, I won again, hahaha..."</span></p>

His complexion greatly changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Then this fellow was like an alarmed rabbit. He let out a shriek, his eyes rolling back to his head, as he fell down from the air. With a bang, he fell to the ground, dust rising, that fell neatly next to the jade-faced scholar that still had his eyes open in unrest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This fellow, with the cover of the rising dust, grabbed a handful of the fresh dripping blood of the jade-faced master, and smothered it all over his body.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This entire process fell completely in Ye Qingyu's eyes.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The sky was suddenly completely right. A radiance and aura that was like the sun itself came to the skies above the [Light Palace].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A vast energy fluctuation that was hard to describe using words exploded from that white light that was like an acute sun. Like a tsunami, it surged throughout the entire space. With the [Light Palace] at it's center, there was a distinct warp in the gravity hundreds of miles around. It was as if the dust particles on the ground had lost its weight, as it seemed to rise slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu was able to sense the aura within his body. It began madly surging with an aura that could not be suppressed, it's yuan qi began to madly rush and fluctuate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "What is this?"</span></p>

He could faintly see that within the white globe of light, there was a skinny figure that could faintly be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "The [Light Palace] has existed for a hundred years, it is fated to be broken apart today... the moon and the sun will swap places, the new replace the hold.

As this voice resounded throughout the air, the piercing white light began to fade. The figure that was wearing the [White Tiger Armour] could finally be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu's pupils dilated.</span></p>

After all it was the Right Minister of the Empire, the most significant person under the Emperor. He was famed throughout the world, and was the focal point of all gazes. No matter whether it was the information provided by Dugu Quan or the Two River Gang, the information that had been given to Ye Qingyu was of the most detailed and informative regarding this person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, for Ye Qingyu, although he had never seen Lin Zheng, but he knew very well what the Right Minister of the Empire looked like.</span></p>

But he was also said to have a mind for strategy and scheming that rarely anyone could compare with. He was also a martial genius, with cultivation that could not be guessed at-----in truth, in this world where martial experts were revered, nearly ninety-nine percent of the government ministers of Snow Empire were martial experts. Without enough martial cultivation, there was no way of standing up within the Imperial Court.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; For Lin Zheng, someone who was born as the son of a concubine, to be able to control the Lin family and step into the position as the Right Minister, this person's strength was prodigious. Not only within the Capital, but even in the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain, he was one of the top ranked experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; It was only that because he occupied such a high position, there were many matters where he did not need to act personally. Slowly, there were many people that began to forget his position and fame within the martial world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; If not for the fact that they stood at opposite ends of the battlefield, Ye Qingyu would even admire this old man.</span></p>

From such a lowly position as a son of a concubine, to walk step by step into the position he was in today, if he was not an absolute genius, it would be utterly impossible for him to achieve this.</span></p>

Within the skies, there was the calm voice of the Right Minister, Lin Zheng, authority present in his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu walked two or three steps forward, paying his respects, "Palace Lord of the Light Palace, Ye Qingyu, sees the Right Minister."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Take the [Flowing Silver Light Formation] away and open the [Light Palace]." The figure of the Right Minister, Lin Zheng, slowly descended down towards the [Light Palace], bringing with him an endless pressure and might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu fell silent for a brief moment, then suddenly lifted his head and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Since the situation has progressed to such a stage, then why must the Right Minister say such useless words?" There was not the slightest hint of fear as Ye Qingyu looked at the Right Minister. "Even a clueless brute, in a desperate situation, will strike back and blood will flow. Could it be that in the eyes of the Right Minister, a Palace Lord like me is not even comparable to a brute?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In the skies.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "The name of Ye Qingyu, I have heard many times before. In truth, in the past sixty years, I was known as the number one genius. But from the years past this point on, the title of the number one genius will fall on your shoulders." On the originally calm face of the Right Minister, there was a hint of a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; “I do not deserve the Right Minister’s praise." Demon King Ye's heart was delighted, but his lips still pretended to be calm and modest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; For the Right Minister of the Empire to evaluate him as the number one genius, if news of this was to spread out, the entire world would be shaken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "I know of the things you did in Youyan Pass. In truth, I admire you very much. But it's a pity, every step along the way, you are acting against me..." The Right Minister slowly descended bove the [Flowing Silver Light Formation], saying, "I admire talents very much. Even if you killed [Red Eagle] and the others, I could not care about it, as long as you came under my wing. I will do my best to nurture and raise you, I could even pass on to you all my status and power."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As these words were said, it was evident just how much Lin Zheng admired Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu smiled, "For the Minister to have such expectations of me, I have endless gratitude for this. But... we are of different paths, so we cannot act together. I'm afraid I must waste Minister Lin's good intentions."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After hearing this Lin Zheng slowly nodded his head, then shook his head, "If it is like this... then it's a pity.”</span></p>

Before he could say anything, within his eyesight, there was a sharp tiger's claw infinitely enlarging.</span></p>

There was the voice of Aunt Heng coming from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As this was said, there was an explosion. A mad energy spread about everywhere, like a chaotic vortex. Ye Qingyu could feel his body lightening and being dragged to one side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; At such a crucial time, Aunt Heng had acted and blocked a strike for Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Little girl Heng, you are not my opponent. Go, don't block my path." Lin Zheng's voice suddenly turned icy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu turned to the side, and could see the complexion of Aunt Heng turning deathly pale, her aura unsteady. It must be that receiving that strike of Lin Zheng had caused her blood qi to be unstable, and received some minor injuries as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; If one lifted their head to look, one would discover that there was a large hole the size of a well that had been broken on the [Flowing Silver Light Formation].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Lin Zheng stood high above, having not yet truly entered into the City of Light.</span></p>

With just one of his thoughts, it could immediately be broken open, that's why he was not in a rush. It was only that there was a little disturbance in the gaze he used to regard Aunt Heng with. It seemed that the two long knew each other, and their relationship was not normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Aunt Heng did not say anything, and made a defensive stance.</span></p>

Furthermore, her strength was even slightly higher than him. But after he had received one of Lin Zheng's palms, her aura was shaken. From the above points, it was enough to determine that Aunt Heng had not yet truly stepped into the Heaven Ascension stage, and was only at the higher stages of the Bitter Sea stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "The situation is settled already. The [Light Palace] will definitely be broken through today. Little girl Heng, you are not my match. Retreat," the Right Minister calmly said.</span></p>

She used a sound transferral technique to speak to Ye Qingyu.</span></p>

He had a lion's mouth and broad shoulders, exceedingly authoritative. His eyebrows were like a blade, hanging above his eyes, making his face seemingly exceedingly mighty.</span></p>
