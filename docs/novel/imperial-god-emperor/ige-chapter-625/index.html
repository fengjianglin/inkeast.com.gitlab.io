Although he was a bit slow, but he eventually still very firmly stood in front of Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the kindest man of Flowing Light City, Elder Zheng. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man had sustained severe injury during the disaster of Flowing Light City, suffered the cruel torture of the Demon Spider Race, and wounded his source. Although he possessed a cultivation base, he was not a martial arts expert. After the torment, his blood and qi were greatly damaged, and in this period of time, in order to think of ways to protect the city, he had exhausted his brain. Having experienced all of this, the old man was in a state of extreme weakness, even panting from saying a few words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone had suggested Elder Zheng to stay in the city to rest to avoid expending yuan qi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the stubborn old man insisted to personally come to meet the Immortal God Emperor Sect experts who came to protect the Flowing Light City. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, as he stepped out, his thin crooked body was trembling as though he could be swept away by the wind at any moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in Ye Qingyu’s eyes, the old man was as solid as a steel wall, shielding him and did not move in the slightest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Three elders are all important people of the Imperial God Emperor Sect, are martial arts experts well known throughout Clear River Domain and have made a name for themselves hundreds or even thousands of years ago. You are older than I am, more senior than me. Moreover, the Immortal God Emperor Sect had saved the Human Race one thousand years ago. Supposedly, I should not contradict you...” Elder Zheng cupped one fist in the other, slightly bowing his body, his aged and gaunt face revealing a dignified expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, he took a deep breath, then very firmly continued, “But I, today, have to say a word for Little Ye...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Ye Qingyu heard these words, a strange warmth gushed from the bottom of his heart. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He closely listened to Elder Zheng continue in a sonorous voice, “I, this old man, have understood the situation. Ye Qingyu is from Heaven Wasteland Domain, who mistakenly stepped into our Clear River Domain. Although I do not know what happened in Greater One Sect, but these are all just baseless accusations and rumours.” At this point, Elder Zheng, because of anxiousness, his blood and qi was bubbling inside, his voice trembling, but his face grew even more serious as he looked the several elders in front in the eye. “From what I saw, I can feel that Ye Qingyu is absolutely not an evildoer, but a Human Race hero. In Flowing Light City, he defeated Devouring Heaven Demon General and killed the black spider twins to save the citizens of Flowing Light City. And on the city walls, I clearly saw that in order to withstand the Prince of the Demon Spider Race, he was blood-soaked, riddled with scars, his breathing was weak and he was on the verge of death. These were what I and the tens of thousands people of Flowing Light City saw with our own eyes. He really is a good person, the hope for the rise of the Human Race...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides getting worked up emotionally, Elder Zheng was repeatedly coughing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing this, Chen Zhengliang, Ling Xiaoran and other people also nodded one after another, taking the opportunity to speak up and explain for Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the people of Flowing Light City were stirred up for a moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they could, they hoped to use all the words and actions that can be used to prove to the people who have misunderstood Ye Qingyu, that he was absolutely not the evil person who would commit any imaginable crime. Instead he was courageous, intelligent, and a gifted Human Race warrior and martial genius.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu rolled his eyes across, noticing the gaze and figure of all people, a different kind of emotions began surging in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, he had always believed that a clean hand needs no washing, the truth will speak for itself, so he was not anxious to explain anything. Time will naturally prove everything. If the three elders of the Immortal God Emperor Sect must denounce him, then he also has no choice but to defend himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the people of the Flowing Light City, who had been fighting alongside him, still stood beside him at this time, had full trust in him, and even spoke up to the elders of the Immortal God Emperor Sect to explain for him. Such friendship, like a warm breeze, brushed Ye Qingyu’s heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Opposite.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three elders looked at one another. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sigh, Junior brother Xie, for so many years, your fiery and impatient temper has not changed a bit.” Elder Mo of the Repository of Buddhist Texts was the first to speak, helplessly casting a glance at Elder Xie, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This...” Elder Xie’s old face also revealed a rare hint of embarrassment. “Impatient, impatient...” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Li of the Martial Arts Hall was the one with the highest status among the three, he shook his head and ran his eyes over the puzzled gaze, and finally his eyes fell on Elder Zheng. “This old man is right, my Junior brother Xie was too rash, he hasn’t explained clearly, that’s just his fiery temper, which has not changed a bit in hundreds of years. No matter where Tianhang is from, or what his identity is, what he has done absolutely deserves the admiration of the Immortal God Emperor Sect. How could some rumours affect our view of a Human Race hero... My Junior brother Xie has heard about Brother Ye’s three swords that shook the Demon Race. Along the way here he kept talking about how he must exchange moves with Tianhang when he sees him. Just now he just couldn’t control himself... He frightened everyone, Junior brother Xie why don’t you come over to apologize to Tianhang.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone heaved a sigh of relief when they heard these words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Zheng's expression finally eased when he heard this. His heart shrank back into his stomach, sighed, and said with a smile, “I see. I, this old man, is also too reckless, I didn’t find out about the situation beforehand.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Face a little red with embarrassment and his sword-like brows raised, Elder Xie came closer to Ye Qingyu and said with a cupped fist salute, “Brother Tianhang, I apologize, I was too impatient. Since young I was a martial maniac. I have also stirred up a few waves in Jianghu before. These years, although I have been living in seclusion and shutting myself away from the matters of Jianghu, but when I heard about little brother’s earth-shaking skills, I couldn’t control myself.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu faintly smiled and seemed to not care in the slightest. “Don’t worry, a martial artist’s road often only consists of cultivating alone, which is boring and tedious. To exchange moves with a master like Elder Xie, for me, is also fate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xie’s face suddenly lit up with joy when he heard this. “Haha, Brother Tianhang you also think so, this couldn’t be better. In fact, just now wasn’t quite enough, why don’t we find a chance later to learn from each other again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu, “....”&nbsp;</span></p>

It was only at this time that all the people were really beaming with happiness, and the shadow that had shrouded Flowing Light City for countless days had scattered. Along the way, they saw that every person wore a smiling expression and the entire Flowing Light City seemed to have been suddenly reborn again.&nbsp;</span></p>

Chen Zhengliang also hoped to take this banquet opportunity to inject a shot of strength to the hearts of those who had suffered in the city. After all, for the city to really recover to its previous size and prosperous state would still need a long period of time. Chen Zhengliang hoped to take this opportunity to reunite the hearts of the people and continue to work hard together.&nbsp;</span></p>

Hundreds of large round tables had been set up inside and outside of the hall and the tables were filled with a variety of fragrant food.
