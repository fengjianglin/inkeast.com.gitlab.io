<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>These series of accusations were like swords stabbing in their hearts. Every word was filled with a powerful scrutinising power.</p>
 <p>Li Qiushui’s visage was pale and wan, falling silent.</p>
 <p>"There are some people that are shameless enough to claim that they came here to answer the call of the Empire, to aid the Youyan army in defending the Pass. They have come here to contribute in the effort to fight against the Demon Race. This sounds like such an admirable and impressive reason." Ye Qingyu stood alone in the air, his voice like the ringing of a great bell. "But before you came to Youyan Pass, did you know who it was that defended such a bitter and hard place for eighty years? Who was it that caused the Southern Incline Legion of the Demon Race to not even be able to take a step into the lands of the Empire? Just who were they?"</p>
 <p>Everywhere fell silent.</p>
 <p>There were lots of expressions of disagreement on the faces of the people of the sects.</p>
 <p>"Ever since Youyan Pass was constructed, the Youyan army has always been stationed here, protecting this place. In the eyes of you Jianghu people that are so high and mighty that you do not even partake in mortal affairs, they are just rough and uncouth military brutes. You look down upon them, you mock them, you laugh at them. Even in Youyan Pass, you take amusement in being difficult to them..." The anger and resentment that accumulated in Ye Qingyu's heart these days could finally be released without any restraint. "You think you are above them, because the sects are the origin of Martial arts. You think that your so called geniuses are the foundation that causes the Human Race to be able to stand tall in this world. Then, right now, I am not afraid to tell you, that you are greatly and utterly wrong. Ever since the Empire was founded, the people who protected the borders of the Human Race, the people who allowed the sects to continue to expand, the people who blocked the invasion of the alien races, the people who defended the dignity of our race, are the army of the Empire. The thousands upon thousands of the rough brutes in your eyes, they used their life and flesh to protect the Empire and the frontier of the Human Race. You people are vermin that takes the harvest of other people, a bunch of arrogant short sighted retards. You broke the peaceful balance of the Empire, causing it to be completely chaotic. Do you think the rule of ‘matters of the Jianghu should be settled in the Jianghu’ is so amazing? Without the army of the Empire shedding their hot blood on the Explosive Ice Plains generation after generation, preventing the southern invasion of Demon Race with their bodies, just how could the so called ridiculous Jianghu exist?"</p>
 <p>"Shut your mouth. Ye Qingyu, the sects cannot be insulted!" Li Qiushui could not help but interrupt with a roar.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's eyes were like lightning, staring piercingly at him. With a cold smile, "The sects cannot be insulted, but do you think the Youyan army can be insulted? Do you think I don't know what the people of the Crepe Myrtle sect did within Youyan Pass?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu flicked his palm.</p>
 <p>The fourth class heroic seal of office of a Marquis of the Empire shined with a scarlet light in his palm. It swirled and rotated, floating, hanging above the sky.</p>
 <p>The seal of office of a Marquis of the Empire, were made by the formation masters of the Empire's group of masters. It could not only be used to indicate the classification and ranking of an officer, it was also a rare treasure. Through the use of yuan qi, it possessed significant offensive power. Furthermore, more importantly, it possessed many other uses.</p>
 <p>Under the activation of Ye Qingyu's yuan qi, scene after scene of yuan qi projections began to appear in the sky.</p>
 <p>The scenes that it depicted were namely the day when he had broken through the abandoned new recruit training camp.</p>
 <p>The process of Ye Qingyu entering the new recruit training camp was exhibited step by step under the night sky. They could see White Browed Yu and the others, appearing within the prison of the training camp, torturing those civilians and guards of the escort company...</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu and White Browed Yu's fight appeared...</p>
 <p>The image of the civilians accusing Qi Yong appeared.</p>
 <p>The scrolls that were found from within the prison...</p>
 <p>The Crepe Myrtle sect disciples holding demonic poison…</p>
 <p>The bitter struggles of those innocent civilians as they were injected with demonic poison. Demonic patterns appearing on their bodies, their appearance changing, from a human transforming into a sinister monster...</p>
 <p>These Demon Race creatures were sent to the [Beheading Demon Platforms]...</p>
 <p>The scene of White Browed Yu and the other being mercilessly interrogated and them confessing to all their crimes...</p>
 <p>The scene of the people of the sects going to the Military supply department to obtain the bounty from handing over the civilians who had turned into demons...</p>
 <p>Scene after scene completely exposed the sickening plot and schemes behind the actions of the sects.</p>
 <p>One of such scenes could be falsely replicated. But the confession of White Browed Yu, the sinister faces on Qi Yong and the others, the scrolls and letters from the Crepe Myrtle sect, the Dragon Tiger sect and other large sects, all formed evidence that could not be replicated.</p>
 <p>Some of these scenes were captured by Ye Qingyu using the powers of the military seal. Some had been found when the Vanguard had collected and gathered evidence, taking it from the hands of some people from the sects. From this, one could see that the people of the sects were not completely united. They still guarded against each other, leaving evidence of the others wrongdoings behind for the use of the Youyan army.</p>
 <p>In these days, Ye Qingyu was like a spear. It seemed like he met the entire forces of the sects by himself. He madly did something that only a crazy person would do. But in reality?</p>
 <p>The Youyan army was still the Youyan army.</p>
 <p>Ever since the banner of Liu Siufeng had arrived at the abandoned new recruit training camp, this represented that the Youyan army had truly begun immersing themselves in such a situation. It was only that there were many people who did not realize such a fact.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was the one standing at the forefront.</p>
 <p>The Youyan army was hidden in the shadows.</p>
 <p>Lu Zhaoge had managed Youyan Pass for tens of years. With his methods and power, the control he had over everything within the Youyan army and Youyan Pass was not something the people of the sects could imagine. It was not something the Three Schools and Three Sects could challenge.</p>
 <p>Lu Zhaoge always thought about matters from the perspective of the greater good.</p>
 <p>He was known as the War God of Youyan, and was ranked within the top ten military gods in Heaven Wasteland Domain. He had experienced countless battles in his life. He had seen too many mountains of corpses and oceans of blood. He was skilled at commanding his forces. As the commander, he used his soldiers like mud. If he always had a tender hearted mindset, it would create an even more unacceptable result than what it would be if he was emotionless.</p>
 <p>From the very beginning, Lu Zhaoge would not place too much consideration into just how many people would die. It was only that Ye Qingyu's brash actions had interrupted the rhythm of the entire Youyan army and had altered the entire plan of the army.</p>
 <p>Evidently, at this time, it was time to reel in the net.</p>
 <p>"These, are all things that your sects have done."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's enraged accusation was like an arrow piercing to the heart. It caused the people below who originally had expressions of discontent, of resentment, to have faces of uncertainty. Some people lowered their heads in shame, some people had faces of disbelief. There were also people who began discussing this in low voices, their fear showing.</p>
 <p>Not all disciples from the sects knew of this matter.</p>
 <p>Similarly, some disciples knew of such matters.</p>
 <p>"Li Qiushui, do you have anything more to say?" Ye Qingyu lifted his short sword, saying angrily.</p>
 <p>"I..." Li Qiushui's expression changed and changed. The left arm that was still intact gripped his right army tightly. Biting his lips, he ultimately said with a cold expression, "I do not know of such matters."</p>
 <p>"You don't know?" Ye Qingyu was surprised, than chuckled loudly. "You don't know. Without your permission, do you think that the disciples of the Crepe Myrtle sect in Youyan Pass will do such matters behind your back? haha, it seems I have overestimated you. I thought you were willing to do such evil things to achieve your aim but at the very least, you had the pride of a martial artist. To not even dare admit such a thing, such a lowly act is really pitiful. Even if I released you today, your martial heart will be broken. Your future cultivation will only fall, the title of a prodigy is really laughable.”</p>
 <p>Li Qiushui's eyes were nearly spitting fire.</p>
 <p>His body trembled slightly, as if he would fall at any moment.</p>
 <p>He could not admit to everything in such a public event.</p>
 <p>Because this was not a matter that solely involved the Martial Alliance. It had escalated to a level that concerned the sects and the Empire. As soon as he admitted this, the Crepe Myrtle sect will be placed in an embarrassing position. At that time, it would most likely endure the thunderous rage of the Empire.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, they were clearly in the wrong in this matter. If news of this were to spread out, the fame of the Crepe Myrtle sect will receive a destructive attack. The glory that came from being a righteous sect would forever fall.</p>
 <p>At this time Li Qiushui began to hate the fact that he did not pay too much attention to such a matter. After all, they had the cooperation of one of the huge figures in the Youyan army, so they did not imagine matters would develop to such a stage. No one imagined that Ye Qingyu was not apprehensive of the power of the Three Schools and Three sects at all. He dared to expose such matters on the arena.</p>
 <p>Li Qiushui did not even imagine in his dreams, that the Martial Alliance meeting he and many other sects painstakingly constructed would end on such a note?</p>
 <p>Why had they tried so hard?</p>
 <p>"If you are not willing to admit this, then I am too lazy to speak anymore." Ye Qingyu coldly smiled. "But everyone should pay the price for their own actions. Even if your martial heart is ruined, you cannot bring back those innocent lives that had passed away. In my eyes, the life of the young leader of the sects cannot even be compared to a vagrant on the streets of Youyan Pass. Zhao Shanhe has gone first. Li Qiushui, kill yourself, don't force me to make my move!"</p>
 <p>There was a killing intent clearly exhibited in his words.</p>
 <p>From the very beginning, Ye Qingyu had never planned to let Li Qiushui and the others off. Ever since he had uncovered such despicable actions on the day he broke through the new recruit training camp, he had alway been in a forcibly suppressed berserk state of rage.</p>
 <p>The day of the Martial Alliance meeting was the day that Ye Qingyu had chosen for slaughter.</p>
 <p>To kill to protect.</p>
 <p>To stop more wrongdoings and to execute those who had done wrong.</p>
 <p>The sect had been arrogant for too long within the borders of the Empire, that they would dare extend their hands so far. At this time, they must make preparations for their paws and claws to be chopped off. Ye Qingyu was not Lu Zhaoge. He was not the commander of the Empire that must bear in mind the greater good. He did not need to consider the balance of power. He only knew that if you wronged, then you must pay a price. Blood must be paid with blood, life must be paid with life.</p>
 <p>No matter who it was, as long as they committed a crime within Youyan Pass, then they should receive their rightful punishment.</p>
 <p>Only by killing leaders leaders with true weight like Zhao Shanhe and Li Qiushui, could it make the people of the sects withdraw their dirty ambitions and methods. Only then would they truly cooperate with the Youyan army in launching the springtime offensive against the Demon Race.</p>
 <p>"You..." Li Qiushui naturally would not be willing to die just like that. His eyes were filled with resentment and anger, glaring at Ye Qingyu across space. "Ye, how dare you push me this far. It's only death, I..."</p>
 <p>"Right now, you are only a dog that has abandoned its own dignity. If you are not willing to end yourself, then I'll send you on your way." Ye Qingyu was too lazy to speak to such a person, his words merciless. The broken sword in his hand struck out yet again.</p>
 <p>Xiu!</p>
 <p>The silver frost, like the moon, was peerless and unmatched.</p>
 <p>An invincible sword aura descended once again.</p>
