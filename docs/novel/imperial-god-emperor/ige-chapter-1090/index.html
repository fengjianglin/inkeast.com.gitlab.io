 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had just casually asked, who would have thought that Song Qingluo actually gave a positive answer. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Song Xiaojun she... is she in Heaven Wasteland Domain?” Ye Qingyu stared at Song Qingluo, eagerly waiting for her answer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Qingluo shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could not help sighing inwardly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He indeed had always been thinking about Song Xiaojun. Was this the so-called fate?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Until now, Song Qingluo still could not figure out how her little sister, who was always in a daze and without any feminine charm, captured the heart of this God-like young man. There were so many stunningly beautiful women, but they could not be compared to the relationship he had with Song Xiaojun for just a semester?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After experiencing so many things and so many changes, how would Ye Qingyu's shadow not be in Song Qingluo's heart? This young man was really too remarkable. Any woman who sees him, no matter how excellent and proud they were, in the end would most likely find it difficult to free themselves from his smile and his gentle and sweet words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Song Qingluo was a student, she saw nothing worthwhile and in the beginning also did not attach any importance to Ye Qingyu. It was only later on when she knew that this was ridiculous. But now, she very clearly understood that, it was already impossible between her and Ye Qingyu. For unknown reasons, people fall in love with others so deeply that the living may die while the dead may turn to the living. She couldn't control herself. In these years, whoever came to her door to ask for marriage, no matter how handsome or how outstanding they were, Song Qingluo simply paid no attention to them nor glanced at them because she knew that her heart had already been filled by a white-robed figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, the distance between the two was too great.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, there was a Song Xiaojun in the middle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Qingluo knew that, the reason the Song family could have what they had today, to a large extent, was because of Song Xiaojun. But even so, every night she sincerely hoped that she was not Song Xiaojun's older sister.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Song Xiaojun did not come personally, but a female sword Immortal came to the Song family to bring some information,” Song Qingluo tidied up her mind and answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah...” Ye Qingyu sighed, evidently a little disappointed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But soon he snapped out of his disappointment and asked further, “Female sword Immortal? Is it Wang Jianru, Teacher Wang?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Correct.” Song Qingluo nodded. “Teacher Wang brought back some gifts from Song Xiaojun to my father and I, and at the same time there was a message to be passed on to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is it?” Ye Qingyu's face lit up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Xiaojun had actually delivered gifts to the Song family, which suggests that her memory had been restored? Otherwise, how would she remember her parents and loved ones? Now that she remembers her loved ones, she should remember him too, right? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher Wang Jianru, invites you to meet on the 7th of the 7th month at the Snow Ground Demon Race's Glass Snow Dragon Altar.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glass Snow Dragon Altar?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was taken aback for a moment, before he realized that she should be referring to the ice crystal altar of the Snow Dragon’s lair under the ice field of the Snow Ground Demon Court. Back then it was also there that Ye Qingyu met the million-year-old soul and obtained the opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Jianru knew about this place and asked to meet there? What could it be about?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today was the 25th of the sixth month, and there was more than ten days till then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu also found that Song Xiaojun and Wang Jianru clearly had a general understanding of his whereabouts. Otherwise, it was impossible for them to know that he could get to the Snow Dragon’s lair in time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I'll be there on time.” Ye Qingyu nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Qingluo didn't say anything more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A moment later, she got up to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu walked the maiden to the entrance of Light City, and then gave a suitable martial arts manual for Song Qingluo to practice before he left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the young girl's rear figure, Ye Qingyu couldn't help sighing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How sensitive was his mind? How would he not know about the maiden's feelings towards him? But it was clearly impossible between the two, and Ye Qingyu also had never felt anything towards this maiden. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing her out of Light City this time, he did not know when they would meet again. Perhaps they would never see each other again in this life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This proud and introverted girl called Song Qingluo may become another legend, but Ye Qingyu would not appear in this legendary story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the next few days, Ye Qingyu traveled around Heaven Wasteland Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He went to Matchless Blade City first, met up with Qin Zhishui and they talked all night. Ye Qingyu also directed Qin Zhishui on his martial arts, added some new secret cultivation manuals to the arsenal of Matchless Blade City, and then again reinforced the defensive formations of the arsenal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, Ye Qingyu had once talked about martial arts and the Dao here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, he did not have much time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he left Matchless Blade City, he went to the southern waters, and paid a visit to the granddaughter of the Great Dragon Turtle Demon, Little Dragon Turtle Chong Xuan, who now was the King of the Water Demon Race. Ye Qingyu patrolled the waters, left behind some formations, and gave some guidance to Chong Xuan on her martial arts before he left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, in the northwest Brute Race, Youyan Pass, and the Three Sects and Three Schools there were also traces of Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Especially the mountain gate of the Crepe Myrtle Sect. He saw that the former cowardly youngster Li Rui was now capable and decisive, and his martial arts and cultivation base had reached an extremely high level. Moreover, as expected, he had married the goddess in his heart, Nan Hua.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the control of the young couple, the atmosphere in today's Crepe Myrtle Sect was very positive, and the sect had restored its power of the past and had a small voice in the martial arts circle of Heaven Wasteland Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Rui and his wife were thrilled to see Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The whole Crepe Myrtle Sect was in high spirits.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu stayed for half a day in Crepe Myrtle Sect, and also lectured for an hour. This was his first and only time lecturing in the Three Sects and Three Schools, thus it was evident that Li Rui had substantial weight in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The news broke out and all sects and factions were shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The status of Crepe Myrtle Sect had been raised to another level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu’s last stop around Heaven Wasteland Domain was the Snow Ground Demon Court.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiao Yu...” Lu Heng was overjoyed to see Ye Qingyu, who she firmly believed to be Yu Junhan's son, and thus had always worried and thought about him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aunt Heng.” Ye Qingyu bowed respectfully as a junior.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Lu Heng was truly an elder deserving of respect, but also one of the few elders in this world who really cares about him, and had also once helped him at all costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Buhui's eyes beamed as he looked at Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Heng was his wife and Ye Qingyu was a junior of Lu Heng, which meant that he had to call him uncle? The Snow Ground Demon King knew that he could not surpass this junior in martial arts in his life, so Yan Buhui’s advantage in seniority was his only balance point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Heng gave an angry stare at her husband.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the years, with the unification of Heaven Wasteland Domain, and coupled with the gradual weakening of the conflicts between the Demon Race and the Human Race and the relaxation of the policy of the empire, the Snow Ground Demon Court was opened to the outside world. The real reason why Yan Buhui betrayed the Human Race and went to the Demon Race also spread around. As a result, the Human Race would certainly have a change of view of Yan Buhui. On the other hand, the Demon Race was affected by the righteousness of Yan Buhui. In these years, Yan Buhui, as the King of the Snow Ground Demon Race, had done many practical and good things for the Demon Race, thus the Demon Race was also incredibly supportive of him. Such a change had finally untied the knot in Yan Buhui's heart. He was no longer as quiet as before, but was livelier and more active, which made Lu Heng both happy and relieved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boy, it looks like it’s likely that you’re not staying long in Heaven Wasteland Domain.” Yan Buhui smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting across the tea table from him, Ye Qingyu answered, “Indeed, I'm leaving in one month.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there something going on?” Yan Buhui asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, it's a very important matter. I need to go to another place to investigate,” Ye Qingyu said vaguely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It's a dangerous place, isn't it?” Yan Buhui asked again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu took a sip of tea, then laughed, “Aunt Heng's tea skills are a lot better than Xing'er.” Then he nodded in response to Yan Buhui's question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Heng smiled, “Xing'er has to take care of all the affairs of the empire, such a large empire is pressed on her alone. She naturally does not have time to immerse in the art of tea making...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Buhui raised his brows and almost blurted out ‘I will go with you’, but soon he realized that Ye Qingyu's strength had already reached a frightening level and he was already one of the top existences in the world. If even he felt it was a dangerous place, then Yan Buhui would only be a burden if he followed him. He did not say anything else and took a sip of tea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the knot in his heart was untied, the Snow Ground Demon King's competitive heart had not diminished in the slightest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiao Yu, have you ever seen Sister Yu Junhan?” &nbsp;Lu Heng hesitated a few times before she finally asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had indeed asked around for the whereabouts of Yu Junhan, but there was not the slightest clue. Even the All-Knowing Tower in Peerless Dragon City did not know anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Maybe, this time I will see Aunt Yu Junhan.” Ye Qingyu added. He felt that since there was no news of Yu Junhan in the Vast Thousand Domains there was only one possibility——Yu Junhan had also gone to the dark domain. It was only everything of this domain that was a fog to the great forces of the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, it was just a guess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He spent two days in the Snow Ground Demon Court before he left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snow Ground ice field.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The boundless snow and ice had turned everything in sight white. A chill was flowing around, and under the illumination of the sun, there was a different kind of beautiful scenery.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu walked through the snow and ice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his mind, he recalled the scenes back then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things stay the same, but people have changed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His divine sense permeated under the ice and snow, and soon he found the location of the Snow Dragon’s lair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thousands of huge snow dragons were asleep under the ice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a slight movement, he instantly broke the ice, arriving inside the ice and snow space below. It was the Snow Dragon’s awakening season. A number of ice crystal Snow Dragons were manoeuvring their way through the ice and snow space, entangled with each other, looking for a mate. It was a rare lively season.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That tremendous Snow Dragon King had woken up.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu caught the attention of the Snow Dragons the moment he arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Wang Jianru who asked him to come. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Human, you... it's you?” The Snow Dragon King stared at Ye Qingyu puzzledly, and finally recognized who he was, the Human Race youngster who woke him up a few years ago while he was hibernating and who possessed the aura of the Dragon God in his body——&nbsp;</span></p>
