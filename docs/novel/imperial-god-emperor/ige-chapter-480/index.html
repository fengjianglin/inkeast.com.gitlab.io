It absolutely should not emit from a huge figure like Right Minister Lin Zheng, who was someone unparalleled in scheming and plotting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But Lin Zheng laughed like such, even so.</span></p>

"Since the Minister's mood is so great, it seems everything has gone successfully."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's right." The Apex Prince, Yu Feiyan that stood far off, approached in large strides. "Everything has gone extremely smoothly. The methods that his majesty has left behind are really unspeakably miraculous. A hundred years has passed, but it was still able to completely capture those demons’ souls that escaped from the formation in the past. Not even one was able to escape. Even those old monsters at the Immortal stage in the past has been exterminated by us."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "The painstaking efforts of a hundred years can finally bloom today." Lin Zheng also gradually stopped laughing. "This time, we have completely swept and cleansed everything, completely removing the ashes of those demons from the other domains. The people of Heaven Wasteland can finally rest assured.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Lu Heng also let out a breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a relaxed expression that appeared on her face, her smile blossoming like the flowering of hundreds of flowers. In front of the [Light Palace] where there were mountains of corpses and rivers of blood, it seem exceedingly beautiful and gentle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "This time, it was all thanks to you two."</span></p>

It was completely different from the previous picture of them doing battle previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "We don't dare."</span></p>

Furthermore, Yu Feiyan and Lin Zheng had in these last decades, fought in the above and under the table countless times. They hated the fact they could not kill the other.</span></p>

"It's only that this plan has too much killing. Although we have exterminated the demons from the other domains as well as the remnants, but the experts of the Human Race also suffered heavily."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Lin Zheng swept his gaze towards the accumulated corpses, with a faint smile, "For the continued flourishment and sustenance of the Human Race of Heaven Wasteland, it is normal for some people to die. Furthermore, out of the Jianghu people, all of them have ambition in their heart, and not willing to be converted to the Empire. They keep using the martial might to ignore the law, arrogantly calling it the 'matters of the Jianghu are settled in the Jianghu.' They are absolutely an unstable part, and does not have much difference to the demons of the other domains. This time, I only utilized the experts of the Jianghu and did not use the armies of the Empire. This was to use this opportunity, to cause them to kill each other, and solve everything all at once."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In such words, there was a sinister killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Everyone sucked in a cold breath inside.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Yu Feiyan also nodded his head, “The people of the sects that were willing to participate in the battle to surround the City of Light were not any benevolent people anyway. In these years, I have interacted with such people too much. I know what they are like deeply, it's better if they are eradicated. Furthermore, today we have also shown mercy towards them. If they were not too greedy and did not enter into the Earth Fire sword pit, they did not need to die. Heng, you do not need to be so sorrowful. Life and Death is fated, this was their own choice."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Lu Heng, upon hearing this, nodded her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But she still let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; At this time, the Old Commander Li Guangbi who always had no patience could finally bear it no longer, "You... this... just what is happening?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This question was completely reflected in everyone's heart.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "His majesty?" Li Guangbi was taken aback. "Is his Majesty not in closed isolation? For him not to appear now, it's most likely..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Yu Feiyan let out a clear laugh, shaking his head, "Closed isolation? that is only a cover. His Majesty as well as the Previous Emperor, in these years, have lived in isolation and not taken care of political affairs. But this is not simply to be in closed isolation and cultivation."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "What?" Li Guangbi was taken aback, then there was delight in his face. He could not believe all of this, quickly asking with an expectation that could not be hidden, "Just what is happening? Why do I know nothing?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As the Old Commander of the empire, before the empire had already even be founded, he had commanded armies, running rampant in all directions. The Li Guangbi at that time was vigorous and ambitious. He wanted to found a powerful and glorious human dynasty, pushing the Human Race of Heaven Wasteland into a pinnacle state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But after the empire was founded, a strange changed occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; First it was that the peerless War God that had supported the empire had disappeared. What followed after that was that the first Snow Emperor had abdicated, then it was the Snow Emperor of current times. But it was only that these two Emperors did not pay attention to the Imperial Court, causing chaos in the Court, without any signs of showing initiative.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Li Guangbi had seen all of this, pain in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He had sent letter and proposal time after time, but had always been restricted, without receiving any reply whatsoever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Afterwards, the heart of the Old Commander also gradually became cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Hearing the words of Yu Feiyan and thinking of the matters that had occurred before, Li Guangbi suddenly guessed at something. Just how could his heart not be overjoyed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "The fact that the two Emperors are in closed isolation... is just a front. It was all for today. If there are no errors in the plan, then it is most likely that at this time, the Domain Gates of the Snow Ground Demon Court, the Hurricane Wave Demon Court, the White Mountain Black Water Brute Race, and the Desert Brute Race has already been completely sealed. It should be difficult to open them again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "What?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This time, the people who exhaled out loud was Dugu Quan and Ouyang Buping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "How is this possible?" Dugu Quan let out a gasp. "You are saying... but the Domain Gate of the four other great other races has long been opened before. They are comparatively stable Domain Gates. Although they are narrow, but they are born from the world. It is absolute hard to shut them, if one tries to forcefully destroy it, it will cause chaos in the domain. Once the chaotic turbulence of spacetime expands, then the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain will be destroyed…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's right. If it was not like so, then the War God in the past would have long completely sealed and shut off the Domain Gates in the territories of the four alien races. Why wait until today?" Ouyang Buping did not believe in what was being said. "With the power of that War God, he was not able to do this. Then why today..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Right Minister, Lin Zheng, let out a faint smile. "These are some methods that War God left behind. Normal methods would truly have no way of sealing off an already stable Domain Gate. But if it is done according to the wishes of the lifeform within the domain, and using the will of all life, and adding to this a formation array and secret technique, it will become possible to seal it off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "The will of all life?" Ouyang Buping was stunned for a moment, seeming to have understood something, then shook his head. "If you want to captured the will of everyone, the civilians of this city that has millions upon millions of people in it. If they would all pray together and attempt to resonate with the world, it may be achievable. But in this period of time, there were not any such thing occurring…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Dugu Quan finally realized something, saying: "The position of the empire receives the worship of all life. There is an Emperor-like aura within the Imperial family, and that Emperor aura comes from the will of all life. Could it... could it be..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "You old fellow, you are not entirely senile." Lin Zheng paid a glance to Dugu Quan. "Snow Empire has been founded for a hundred years. It has gathered the fortune of the Imperial family in the last hundred years. members of the Imperial family will have the enhancement of this Imperial aura. After obtaining the secret techniques of that uncomparable War God, they could absolutely use such a method to attempt to seal off the Domain Gates of the four great Demon Courts. “</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As these words were said, Dugu Quan, Ouyang Buping, and Li Guangbi instantly realized something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; But very quickly, Li Guangbi frowned. He said, “The Domain Gates of the four other races belong to heavily guarded areas. It is protected extremely seriously, outsiders can rarely enter. If one performs an ambush, it is possible to achieve this. But the peerless experts that has the Imperial aura of Snow Empire flowing through them are in the rarity, there are not four. Therefore there is no way of attacking the four great courts of the other races first. If one chose to first attack something now and some later, there is no way of stopping the news from spreading. The Two Snow Emperors, no matter which location each chooses to attack, the other two locations will definitely receive news of this and make their preparations. To want to seal off all the Domain Gates is indeed utterly difficult!"&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Yu Feiyan only let out a faint smile. "Who said there are only the Two Snow Emperors that has the fate of the Imperial family of Snow Empire running through them and are peerless experts. Old Commander, think more carefully."</span></p>
