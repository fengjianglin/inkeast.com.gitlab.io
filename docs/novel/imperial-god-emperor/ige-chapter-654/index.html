Haha, boy, you can be said to be reaching the sky in one step, rapidly going up in the world, but I also have to remind you that, in the future, when you're at Palace Lord Ye’s side, you have to be good.

His white robe was like snow, his black hair was as dark as ink, his brows were long and sword-like, and his demeanour was like that of an Immortal. It was the one in charge of Light City, Light Palace Lord Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>

Laughing and joking, and some were even secretly hiding behind the city walls gambling, like a group of market gangsters. These should be the legendary Light City soldiers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Luo Yi saw the Light soldiers he understood how the rumours about them came about, but he was still greatly amazed.</span></p>

These were all taboos of the military.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this had happened among the imperial guards, they would have been strictly punished according to military law.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, in the battle of the Light City, he displayed his real strength. He was unexpectedly a divine archer who could shoot dead the [Purple Eagle] and the [Violent Archery God] of the [Cold-Blooded Thirteen Eagles].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He continued thousands of meters into the depths of the Light Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Near the station of the third area.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was only after sensing the power and aura of Light Envoy Yang that Luo Yi really felt for the first time from a close range the boundary of essence, energy, and spirit gathered into one of a martial artist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, the other few Light Envoys did not appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in the Fire Tree Woods, there was a calm, young, burly figure with black hair bunched up at his back, who was focusing on sweeping the leaves, that caught his attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the figure did not reveal a shred of strength or yuan qi, and looked like an ordinary person, but Luo Yi keenly observed that there was a thin gauze around the broom in his hands that was driving the movement of leaves. Surprisingly, without touching, the leaves in front of him were all gathered together...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Luo Yi knew that the figure in front should be the legendary General Gong who had suppressed two Heaven Ascension experts before by himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the Battle of the Light Palace, the number of imperial guards that participated was less than ten thousand, and the majority were on standby at the most peripheral areas of Light City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the Jianghu sects of Heaven Wasteland Domain that had fought inside the city were finally suppressed in the sword pit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result of the Snow Empire’s imperial family's deliberate interception, the majority of the information had not spread out through rumours.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But ever since Luo Yi had come to the Snow capital, he still had heard some gossip amongst the imperial guards of the [Blazing Flame Battalion].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that war, of the mighty experts that emerged in the Light City, there was not a single one who had not became an idol of the soldiers of the [Blazing Flame Battalion].</span></p>

He secretly gazed at the legendary figures and matched them to their description one after another.&nbsp;</span></p>

Their strength was far above Luo Yi's. Adding to this, their cultivation techniques and moves were very unusual, and completely different to the traditional martial arts that ordinary soldiers practiced. Moreover, he had never heard of rumours of these several youngsters, in other words...</span></p>

It was Ye Qingyu, who all the imperial guards and the countless martial artists of the Snow Empire crazily worshipped. He suddenly looked startled, hurriedly concentrating his mind and calming his emotions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu had seen the young man before in the Crown Prince imperial palace. He thought his foundation, power of understanding, and aptitude were extraordinary, and he exuded an aura that kind of felt close, yet he could not see through entirely. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At present, the Light City was in need of staff. All matters in Light City were managed by Gao Han who had more tasks than what he could deal with. And the other people, whether it was Li Changkong, Wen Wan, or the gambling addict Wang Lijin, were all madmen. They could indeed fight, but on management, they were almost the same as the mentally deficient, and were not suitable as attendants.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a brief investigation, Ye Qingyu was very pleased to know that Luo Yi's aptitude and character were extraordinary. In addition to the three generations of his family being part of the military, he was a suitable talent who met the requirements that Ye Qingyu looked for in order to cultivate someone who was as meticulous as Gao Han.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the consent of Yu Xiaoxing, Ye Qingyu asked Bao Shinu to transfer Luo Yi over from the [Blazing Flame Battalion].&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dare not to... reporting to Lord, it is the duty of soldiers to obey military orders...” taken aback, Luo Yi answered hurriedly. After a pause he again added, “To be able to work with Lord is my honour. All my comrades are envious...” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu smiled. “Fine, I can rest assured then. You have already seen the content of the official seal, you must be clear of your new job in the Light City. You have just come, you must not be familiar with the Light City. Later on, Gao Han will take you to look around. You can ask him anything that you don't fully understand.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Yi responded with a solemn expression, “Subordinate understands!”</span></p>

The sword body was transparent and clear, glowing with a restrained blue light, and the two bronze sword hilts were inlaid with dove-egg sized blue crystals.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Yi injected yuan qi into the sword body, and the next moment, the restrained brilliance of the sword body instantly erupted into a dazzling golden blue colour. The transparent sword body revealed two strange golden marks which, under the activation of yuan qi, seemed to be alive, winding around the sword in a complicated route, leaving two golden patterns.&nbsp;</span></p>

The next moment, he swung out his sword in a flash, the force of a dragon broke out along with a piercing whistle. The golden tip of the sword was incomparably sharp, ripping a number of space cracks in the void, and a frightening aura pervaded the air. The speed of his sword was very fast, and his every action was extremely strange, seemingly disorganized, but the sword broke through the wind.&nbsp;</span></p>

But his handed down sword technique was too rigid, the level was not high enough. And although Luo Yi had already performed this set of sword technique to his full strength, it was limited by the sword technique, and lacked power. Luo Yi was like an unpolished jade, with great care and cultivation he would certainly make great progress on the martial arts road. The passed down Broken Wind sword technique was not suitable for him. He needed a more suitable cultivation method. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

Ever since he started in White Deer Academy, his martial arts and skills were all something he learned himself with his extraordinary talent. He could be said to have learned without a teacher and no one had heard that he ever had a Master. The techniques that he used were often unique, powerful, and rarely seen before. In addition, the people who received his guidance had all became top experts.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was said that he and the renowned Pill God of the Snow Empire Dugu Quan and the Divine Doctor Ouyang Buping were peers and close brothers. His understanding of Pill methods and his medical knowledge had astonished both Dugu Quan and Ouyang Buping. There were also rumours that the Palace Lord had a profound understanding of weapon refinement, which had reached a divine level, but no one had been able to personally verify yet.&nbsp;</span></p>
