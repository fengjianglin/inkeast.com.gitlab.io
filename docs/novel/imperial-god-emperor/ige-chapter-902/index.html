 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After doing some mental weighing, Ye Qingyu did not rush into making a decision and instead asked, "Mr. Ren Puyang, could you enlighten me on what kind of place this [Divine Weapon Hall] is?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had become highly curious of every mysterious forbidden area within the Alliance of Domains ever since he got to see the [Infinite Arsenal] of the Alliance's congress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To one side, Ren Puyang grabbed an ocher-colored document out of one of the bookshelves behind him and read through it quickly. After thinking for a bit, he explained, "By and large, it's similar to the [Infinite Arsenal] and was also created by a nameless martial emperor. It specializes in collecting ownerless divine weapons of this world. Ever since it came into being, whenever an expert perishes among the myriad domains, those undamaged divine weapons which are rendered ownerless would be stored in there."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Ren Puyang did not go into detail, Ye Qingyu was nevertheless shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He immediately realized that, over hundreds of thousands of years, the divine weapons stored in there were probably as uncountable as the sand grains of the Ganges, or comparable in number to the techniques in the [Infinite Arsenal].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This [Divine Weapon Hall] could most definitely be considered the arsenal with the richest collection in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Immortal, you said that I can pick any weapon below an emperor one... wouldn't that mean there are actually emperor weapons stored in the [Divine Weapon Hall]?" Ye Qingyu's eyes gave off a splendor as he could not help questioning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm not too sure about that. Perhaps and perhaps not. Like the [Infinite Arsenal], the mysteries of the [Divine Weapon Hall] aren't completely known even to the higher-ups of the Alliance. I've heard stories that tens of thousands of years ago, after a Quasi-emperor-level expert and his race perished, their life weapons were kept into there. And a hundred thousand years ago, a Great Emperor had emerged in this world, and so there should be emperor weapons in there, but..." Ren Puyang laughed when he spoke to this point. "But you don't have to think too much about it. Leaving aside the fact that you may only pick a divine weapon which is below an emperor weapon, given your present strength, you wouldn't be able to successfully obtain a divine weapon even if you are interested in one, for they are spiritual and are comparable in power to a martial emperor in their complete form. Even if you get to see one face-to-face, you wouldn't necessarily gain its recognition, which more so values an individual's opportunity and fate."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu nodded thoughtfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having heard all this, he was by now very clear about the two rewards from the Alliance of Domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he still wanted to hear Ren Puyang's recommendation before he could make a proper decision, and so he asked sincerely, "Mr. Ren Puyang, just one more question. Which do you suggest?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The latter smiled when he heard this, albeit his expression became somewhat graver than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had mentally weighed these two choices on behalf of Ye Qingyu countless times already, and knew very well that they were completely different in substance and nature, such that they were even polar opposites. The deputy position would grant Ye Qingyu influence in the form of status elevation but would have no effect on his personal cultivation. Conversely, the divine weapon choice would grant him strength, causing his battle strength to skyrocket in a highly tangible fashion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each would lead to different changes to his future growth once chosen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hesitating for a bit, Ren Puyang slowly placed the document in his hand down and spoke up once more, with his expression returning to one of calm, "I shall mention a few points now that you've asked. Both rewards were what a few other human sages in the Alliance and I did our best to fight for on your behalf, and we even paid a little price in exchange. They thus can be considered hard-earned and are once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for any warrior in this world... But if you already have a suitable weapon in hand, you might want to consider choosing the former. Although you'd only be a deputy in name and cannot command the Alliance's divine guards, you'd ultimately gain proper status within the Alliance, which is what you and the Heaven Wasteland Domain are most lacking in right now. To a certain extent, becoming my deputy will grant you the right to do things. Besides, other races and forces would have to consider this status of yours if they ever think about laying a finger on you thenceforth."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, there was an even deeper reason which Ren Puyang did not mention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although this deputy status did not come with actual authority, it would open the gates of the Alliance for Ye Qingyu. By taking up this position, he would enter the Alliance's power framework and would eventually have room and opportunity for promotion. The most fundamental goal of Ren Puyang and several other human representatives was precisely to get a human Heaven's prideling like him to join the Alliance. Put even more bluntly, Ren Puyang was preparing to groom Ye Qingyu to become his own successor. Although Ren Puyang was peerless in wisdom and strength, his methods had always been typically mild, and over so many years, he gradually felt that the Human Race might be better off with a hard-hitting spokesperson. Someone like Ye Qingyu, who appeared crazy yet was able to create a lifeline with his choices every time he did things, would be able to fight for even more benefits for and consolidate the atmosphere among the Human Race. This was one of the reasons why Ren Puyang thought so highly of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, there was no need to let Ye Qingyu know this reason so soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Ren Puyang did not wish for his own analysis and intervention to overly affect the choice and future development of this young human Heaven's prideling. After all, everyone had their own disposition and destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked smilingly at Ye Qingyu after offering his suggestion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It would now be up to Ye Qingyu to decide which path to take.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was silence for some time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only the gentle circulation of the air could be heard in the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his eyes lowered, Ye Qingyu was deliberating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He already had the [Blood Drinker Sword] which he personally refined, and although its power was currently not at the level of a divine weapon, there was still room for growth. And even if it never attained an ideal level, he still had the [Cloud Top Cauldron] which was a treasure comparable to a divine weapon. With these two weapons at hand, he had no real need for a divine weapon. As they say, one should not bite off more than one can chew, and besides, the divine weapons would not necessarily suit him. Conversely, the deputy status seemed more suitable for him at present. He did not really mind not attaining real authority, and believed that this status would make it a lot easier for him to do things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, the protection offered by the Alliance would have a suppressive effect on those forces hiding in the dark. Furthermore, given that the Heaven Wasteland Domain had just passed their grading and business there was beginning to prosper, it would be extremely advantageous to its development and security if he could take up a deputy position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After half an hour or so, he had thoroughly established the pros and cons of both choices. Raising his head, he kept a straight face and said, "Mr. Ren Puyang, I've thought things through... I've decided to take up the deputy position and forgo the chance to enter the [Divine Weapon Hall]."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright." Ren Puyang nodded and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he did not want to intervene in Ye Qingyu 's choice too much, this answer was in agreement with his deepest thoughts, and so his mood instantly improved greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two chatted a while longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that considerable time had passed, Ye Qingyu intended to take his leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ren Puyang summoned in Tang Chong, the white-robed divine guard who was standing on the porch, before he stood up and patted Ye Qingyu on the shoulder, "The modification of the two Black Moon Immortal Palace warships will be completed in another ten days or so. You may bring them back when the time comes. One more thing, I'll be leaving Heaven Connect City for an indefinite period of time in two days. You may contact Little Tang Chong if you have any issues during this period. In a while, he'll be bringing you to complete the procedures of taking up the position."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing this, Ye Qingyu snapped in surprise, "Mr. Ren Puyang, you're leaving Heaven Connect City?!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He said he hasn't left Heaven Connect City for many years, which is reasonable considering his role as the spokesperson of the Human Race in the Alliance of Domains. It would be more abnormal for him to leave the city, yet he even said he'll be away for an indefinite period of time. What could be so important that he has to see to it personally for an extended period?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Though he had these inner doubts, Ye Qingyu did not ask further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some things which should not be asked about since Ren Puyang did not talk about them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After nodding and saluting Ren Puyang farewell, he left together with Tang Chong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The procedures for taking up a position were very tedious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Though it was merely a deputy position, he nevertheless had to go through many verification checkpoints and submit a lot of identity information to various departments, such was how complicated the procedures were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hours later, Tang Chong led Ye Qingyu to submit a portion of the necessary information and temporarily received a strip-shaped, silver-colored token which was round on top and squarish below. On it were the Alliance of Domains' symbol and Ye Qingyu's title. However, this did not mean that all of the procedures had been completed. It was at this time that Ye Qingyu realized how tedious the various inspections and formalities of the Alliance were. Having existed among the Vast Thousand Domains for countless years and developed until the present day, this yet-mighty behemoth had inevitably become overstaffed and was growing a little unwieldy.</span></p>

The other procedures will take some time to be completed. You may return to your station for now and await further news." Tang Chong remained as respectful as ever.</span></p>

Many people believed this to mean that Ye Qingyu had been released by the Alliance of Domains, and used this belief to invertedly prove that Ye Qingyu had been locked up in the Alliance of Domains’ prison all this time. This version of events was given further credence by the fact that Ye Qingyu had covertly proceeded to Ren Puyang's place earlier on, and so nobody knew about that. All kinds of interpretations began to swirl in the city after a large majority of the public agreed with this speculation.&nbsp;</span></p>
