 <p>Chapter 237 - White Browed Yu</p>
 <p>The moonlight was reflected on the white clothes like water.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu returned to the entrance of the caves.</p>
 <p> There were several hundred people of the sects that had already transformed into ice sculptures. They were either fractured or otherwise completely intact. It added a few extra points of otherworldly and bizarre beauty to this chaotic new recruit training camp. The holy moonlight shined on every ice sculpture, causing it to be translucent like jade, the lines smooth to the extreme. Every one of their expressions was realistic and lively, as if it was a perfect piece of art.</p>
 <p> No one would ever imagine that these ice sculptures were constructed from flesh and blood.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu once again inspected Ye Congyun’s wounds.</p>
 <p> The situation was not positive.</p>
 <p> Although Ye Qingyu had used his inner yuan to extend his life, but the body of the young officer originally belonged to those with weak blood[1] [2] . He originally had a weak foundation and after experiencing this cruel torture, his original condition got even worse. Ye Qingyu had used the secret technique of martial artists to buy a lease to his life, but it would not last long. Although Ye Congyun's complexion seems much better and his face seemed less pale, but in reality the life force within his body was like a candle in the wind. It could snap at any moment in time.</p>
 <p> This was not the way to go if this continued.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu thought it over then took out a [Mysterious Heaven Pellet] saying, "Your injuries are not light. Ingest this medicine, it can boost your life force. When this matter is settled, I will go find the military doctor to help you take care of your body.” "You don't need to worry about me Marquis." Ye Congyun rushed to refuse. "Subordinate I already feel much better. After resting for a while in the camp, I will be fine after several days.” </p>
 <p> Although he did not know the background of that jade-like Longan pill in Marquis Ye's hand was, but in this world, once it had some relationship to the word 'pill', then it must be something extremely valuable. Ye Qingyu was able to sense the care of the new nobility within Youyan Pass, Marquis Ye. Apart from feeling excited, he was also somewhat conflicted. As the saying goes, he could not accept a reward without doing anything, so Ye Congyun did not want to easily accept the favour of Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p> "There are still some problems in your body. First take the medicine. we'll speak of other matters later." Ye Qingyu gave off a smile saying, "Your brother is my friend, so I should take care of you. As for your weak constitution, I will help you solve it later.” "Brother?" Ye Congyun was taken aback, his expression somewhat confused. "My brother, half a year ago, he already… could it be?" </p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu nodded his head, not concealing anything. "Your brother died to save me. I sent many people to search for you in Youyan Pass, but I could not find you at all until now. If not for the fact that I coincidentally encountered your name today, I don't know just how long I would have been searching for.” </p>
 <p> Ye Congyun lowered his head. A teardrop, flashed by in his eyes.</p>
 <p> He very quickly lifted his head. His expression returning to normal, returning as calm as he ever was.</p>
 <p> "I have already learned of my brother’s death in the notice of the army. So he died protecting Marquis you. My brother has always been honoured to serve within the [Youyan army]. After being allocated as a sentry in the watchpost, he had no way of continuing to slaughter the demons so he had always been unhappy. He once said to me that he entered in the army not for power or glory but to protect the borders and protect his race. Even if in the end he gives up his life on the battlefield, he will die with no regrets. I believe that by dying to protect you, he will have died with no regrets at all. If he is able to know what you have done today in Youyan Pass right now, he will definitely feel pride and excitement.” </p>
 <p> There was a faint smile appearing on the face of the young officer.</p>
 <p> He lifted his head to look at the blue green moonlit sky. In the clustered stars, it was as if he could see his brothers strict but kind smile.</p>
 <p> "Ingest the medicine. I'll guard you." Ye Qingyu handed over the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet]. "If you're brother is aware in the heavens, he will also hope that you will live on. If you are able to inherit his wishes and soar to the skies within Youyan Pass, he will definitely be even more happy. But first of all, you must take care of your own body.” </p>
 <p> Ye Congyun thought for a bit, but did not see any reason to refuse so he took the pill.</p>
 <p> The [Mysterious Heaven Pellet] dissolved instantly in the mouth, and a cold feeling spread throughout his body. Then it became painful, like a steel needle running through his muscles. Ye Congyun let out a low grunt, beads of sweat appearing on his forehead. But the pain once again incited his body, making his life energy explode yet again. The pain very quickly disappeared, turning into pure inner yuan that travelled throughout his body, repairing his injured body and restoring his vitality.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu stood guard by one side. One of his palms was pressed against Ye Congyun's shoulder, so he could clearly sense everything that happened.</p>
 <p> The effects of the [Mysterious Heaven Pellet] was even better than what he had imagined.</p>
 <p> No wonder yuan qi was the purest energy in this world. Under the restorative properties of the yuan qi in the pill, the injuries of the young officer recovered rapidly.</p>
 <p> A [Mysterious Heaven Pellet] was equal to half a year’s cultivation of a thirty to forty Spirit springs expert. The medicinal properties were powerful but absolutely not dominating. Even if used on Ye Congyun who had not even entered into the Spirit spring stage, he was still able to withstand it.</p>
 <p> But pills to increase yuan qi were after all not entirely suitable for treating illnesses.</p>
 <p> To want to continue bolstering Ye Congyun's life force, and to want to solve the problem of his weak blood constitution[3] , there was still a need for an alternative method.</p>
 <p> As Ye Qingyu was thinking of just what he could do to solve Ye Congyun's problem, there were strong energy fluctuations coming from the outside. The air was parted as numerous figures tore through the skies like shooting stars, arriving in the chaotic camp.</p>
 <p> "There are true experts arriving!" </p>
 <p> Ye Congyun awakened from his state of recovery. Seeing this scene, he was stunned.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu was like as if he had long predicted this scene. There was a smile of disdain on his lips, but within the smile, there was another chill that made the Ye Congyun by his side feel as if a sharp blade was pressing against his heart. This feeling was just like when Ye Qingyu had acted to slaughter all the Jianghu people in the camps.</p>
 <p> Boom! </p>
 <p> The instant numerous experts landed, a powerful yuan qi fluctuation swept the entire new recruit training camp.</p>
 <p> These were the true experts of the sects.</p>
 <p> The instant this aura appeared, it made even Ye Qingyu feel suffocation.</p>
 <p> There were four people in total who had appeared. Two were young, one was wearing a uniform armour and was somewhat handsome. His body was tall and slender and was namely the distribution officer of the military supply department, Zhao Ruyun. The other had white eyebrows and a hook nosed, tall and slim. He had an authoritative aura around his body, like a peerless long sword. And the middle men next to these two wore loose clothes of the sects. They had a natural authority on their faces, evidently characters who had held high statuses and positions for a length period of time. Their aura was not normal at all.</p>
 <p> The instant the four appeared, they instantly went near the center of the new recruit training camp.</p>
 <p> The scene in front of them caused the colour of their faces to change abruptly.</p>
 <p> "What has happened? Everyone… has died! This is the Empire's camp, just who would dare to appear to kill people? Who did it, scram out right now…" Zhao Ruyun was the first person to burst out and let out a scream. Evidently he was extremely shocked and furious.</p>
 <p> The other three noticed at the first instant Ye Qingyu and Ye Congyun's existence.</p>
 <p> Between experts, one could sense the opponent even without using eyes but through aura alone.</p>
 <p> And they were able to recognize Ye Qingyu the first moment they laid their eyes on him.</p>
 <p> [The Leaf of Youyan] already had a significant fame in killing people within the Jianghu. Especially amidst the Jianghu people in Youyan Pass. After experiencing the events of these past days, Ye Qingyu was a character they were extremely wary off. There were long portraits of Ye Qingyu circulated between the large sects. Even if they did not see Ye Qingyu before personally, after seeing the portrait, they would know just how the new Marquis with such a killing intent looked like.</p>
 <p> These three had gazed at the portrait before, so they instantly recognized Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p> The fourth to react, was Zhao Ruyun </p>
 <p> The him with bolstering aura, when he saw Ye Qingyu, both his knees weakened. He nearly bowed to the ground with a bang. At that moment, Zhao Ruyun really wished he could turn back and leave. He hoped with all his heart that he had not appeared here today. It was a pity that everything was already too late… "Ma— Mar… Marquis Ye, what are you doing there?" </p>
 <p> The attitude of Zhao Ruyun greatly changed.</p>
 <p> Even today, he could still recall the scene of him assisting Zhang San returning to the great hall of the military supply department. The cold spot of blood that Zhang San spat out was enough to freeze the bravery of Zhao Ruyun. Ever since then, this incomparably arrogant distribution officer, became like a different person. The majority of the time he was somewhat distracted.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu gave him a glance, not saying anything.</p>
 <p> He really did not want to waste his time on such a character.</p>
 <p> His gaze fell on the three people beside Zhao Ruyun, carefully evaluating.</p>
 <p> Opposite.</p>
 <p> "You are Ye Qingyu?" the white-eyebrowed hook nosed young man finally opened his mouth. His tone held an unconcealed arrogance. "You are not as great as the rumours suggest… what, was it you who killed all the people here?" “White Browed Yu” Ye Qingyu frowned. "The Setting Sun and Great River sect?" </p>
 <p> The white browed young man was slightly taken aback, then began proudly smiling, "You've heard of my name? Haha… today within the camp, there are three disciples of the Setting Sun and Great River sect. It seems like Marquis Ye did not let them go. The title of butcher is indeed quite fitting for you. I wonder what the reason that you have killed tonight is…" "I did not imagine that the Setting Sun and Great River sect would fall to such depths. Good, very well." Ye Qingyu nodded his head, not waiting for him to finish his sentence before breaking him off. “Since you have arrived here today, then don't leave." </p>
 <p> As he spoke to here, his gaze moved to the authoritative middle-aged men next to him. Coldly sneering, "Tell me what are your identities so that the great prison of the Vanguard can prepare manacles and shackles for you." "Ridiculous," the middle-aged man with a long beard on the left said, shaking his head. "If a young man has some abilities, it is understandable if he is a little arrogant. But you, you think you are far too important. You really think that just by relying on the tiny little position of a Marquis, you can do as you wish? If other people respect you, you are a Marquis. If they don't respect you, you are only an arrogant and loud mouthed junior. Don't pretend to be self-important in front of me, you are by far not enough." "You really have too many useless words." Ye Qingyu coldly laughed. "Old thing, state your name."</p>
