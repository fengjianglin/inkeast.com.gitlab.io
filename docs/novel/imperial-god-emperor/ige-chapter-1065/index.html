 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How dare you insult me?" Ye Chongsheng cried out in rage and struggled with all his might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt that all his blood had rushed into his head and that he was about to explode. No one had ever dared to step on him and hurl insults at him, so he felt himself going crazy. He frantically exerted his yuan qi and used a mysterious technique to activate the mysteries of the [Purple Gold Divine Dragon Armor]. Purple-golden light exploded with an ear-splitting roar of a True Dragon and a mighty force surged forth as he finally managed to free himself from Ye Qingyu's feet.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm going to kill you." Ye Chongsheng was on the brink of insanity. His eyes were bloodshot and he released a feral growl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He activated the dragon saber and dragon sword of his [Purple Gold Divine Dragon Armor] and they transformed into a purple-gold hurricane that charged toward Ye Qingyu.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bam!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smashed out with his fist and easily sent him flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Baboom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Chongsheng crashed heavily against the pillar of the mourning hall with a loud bang. The ice formations above it flickered and cracks appeared on the pillar. If Ye Qingyu had not reinforced the pillar with his ice formations, it would have been smashed by the frightening force.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Trash will always remain trash," Ye Qingyu said coldly as he drew closer to Ye Chongsheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shut up! You're just a lowly being from a lower domain... Hahahaha, I can continue to battle you, haha. The [Purple Gold Divine Dragon Armor] is an Emperor weapon, so as long as you can't break past my defenses, I'll be able to drain you of all your power," Ye Chongsheng growled angrily like a lunatic. He laughed maniacally and ferociously as he exerted his [Purple Gold Divine Dragon Armor] to its maximum limit. Wisps of Emperor qi circulated in the midst of its purple splendor mist, as though multiple purple-gold dragons were swirling around him.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He calmed down and changed his combat strategy. He decided that he would drain Ye Qingyu of all his yuan qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Moron, when an Emperor weapon is controlled by someone like you, it is like a child trying to wield a knife. How powerful could it be then?" Ye Qingyu charged forward in a flash and used his dragon claws to tear apart the protective dragon qi that surrounded the armor. Then, he sent Ye Chongsheng flying with a kick.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom! Boom Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless fist prints rained down frantically on Ye Chongsheng like a violent tempest.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu constantly changed positions in the Void; it was as though dozens of Ye Qingyus had appeared at once. Fist prints appeared from various points in the Void and gave Ye Chongsheng a good beating while he was still sailing through the air. He was unable to crash to the ground, nor was he able to control his own body. He was like a stalk of grass that had been swept into a violent tempest—he was in a miserable state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Chongsheng was also a peak Great Saint expert and he was now extremely strong after his power received a boost from the [Purple Gold Divine Dragon Armor]. He could be considered the most terrifying person present amongst all the experts, but he was still not Ye Qingyu's match and was not even able to counter with an attack of his own. If it were not for the [Purple Gold Divine Dragon Armor], he would probably have been reduced to a pile of rotten flesh by this time.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang! Bang! Bang!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the punches rained down on Ye Chongsheng, everyone in the mourning hall felt as though they were experiencing the same force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many experts of the foreign races had turned pale.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene was far too terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one could understand how a human from a lower domain—a barbarian who was from a new domain that fell so far behind the civilization of the martial way—could become so powerful in such a short period of time. Was he the reincarnation of an ancient martial Emperor? Each time they assumed they had already overestimated his strength and had already taken all precautions, Ye Qingyu would tear their misconceptions apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had a feeling that Ye Qingyu would be able to increase his strength at any given moment as long as the situation called for it, regardless of who his opponent might be.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All these experts of the foreign races were consumed with regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They should have heeded his earlier warning and left the mourning hall while they still had the chance to do so.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They did not take him seriously back then, but now that the entire mourning hall was sealed in ice, it was like a jail cell. Mo Pi had put all his might behind his attack earlier but he was still unable to force the doors open. This meant that it wasn't practical to try to force the door open because they might also provoke Ye Qingyu and die an even earlier death. This Madman Ye was clearly trapping all of them here to beat them into submission, and he was not planning to let a single one of them off the hook.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a tremendous crash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Chongsheng slammed heavily to the ground once again.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He landed with such a tremendous crash that tremors shook the entire mourning hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Chongsheng slumped to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [Purple Gold Divine Dragon Armor] was covered in foot prints and fist prints, and each print had clearly dented his armor. They were several inches deep and the fist marks could clearly be seen; it was a ghastly sight. The divine relic, the [Purple Gold Divine Dragon Armor], was a shadow of its original structure and now resembled a piece of purple-gold scrap metal.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Chongsheng, who was enveloped within the armor, had probably turned into minced meat.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon afterward, a powerful healing energy was released and purple qi swirled around it, the [Purple Gold Divine Dragon Armor] regained its original form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You... you can't kill me..." Ye Chongsheng's voice rang out from within the armor tauntingly. "Hehe, hahahaha, what can you do to me now?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It did not matter if he was beaten into a pulp, as long as his spirit was unharmed, he could still heal himself instantly.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once a martial artist attained the Great Saint realm, their blood qi was so abundant that even if their physical bodies were smashed into pieces, they would be able to heal themselves with a single thought. Although the [Purple Gold Divine Dragon Armor] had been dented by Ye Qingyu's powerful force, it had the ability to block all mental energy. Therefore, it could protect his spirit from coming to harm. And as long as his spirit was not injured, his blood qi would remain abundant and it would be easy to restore his physical body.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sure enough, Ye Chongsheng failed.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He attacked the [Cloud Top Cauldron] with a fake Emperor weapon in his hands but he was unable to break the [Cloud Top Cauldron].

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Aah…" He screamed like a defeated dog and transformed into a flowing light that hurtled toward the doors of the mourning hall.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smirked coldly and raised his hands slightly.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blood-colored dagger turned into a rainbow and streaked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clink!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No… I don't want to die." He struggled in panic. He could not believe that things had turned out so horribly for him. And as he looked at Ye Qingyu, who slowly strode toward him, he immediately started to beg for his life, "Please spare me. I was wrong. I admit defeat!"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone as vengeful as Ye Chongsheng would not feel grateful even if his life was spared.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And since the situation had already reached this point, he would not show him any mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, if he released this snake, it might come back to bite him.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was not afraid of Ye Chongsheng but he was worried that his friends would get hurt because of his actions. It would be impossible to try to defend them against every possibility, so it would be best to get rid of the root of the problem. In any case, any form of cordiality between them was thoroughly ruined, so Ye Qingyu did not think that there would be any way to repair their relationship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No, no, no, listen to me…" Ye Chongsheng tried to explain.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu wasn't having any of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Chongsheng started to frantically beg for his life. "Please calm down. There isn't a deep enmity between us, so please spare me. I don't want to die. You can't kill me… I'm a descendant of an ancient lost tribe, and the blood of a Human Race martial Emperor flows within my body… No, if you kill me, you'll bring disaster upon yourself…" He sniveled miserably as tears ran down his cheeks.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arrogance that Ye Chongsheng had displayed earlier was gone and his face was twisted in fright, but he was unable to free himself from the blood-colored dagger that pinned him down like a dog in front of the door. He twisted and turned but the Blood Drinker force from the dagger gradually spread out across his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they saw how frightened Ye Chongsheng was, in addition to their fearful looks, flashes of derision and scorn also appeared on the faces of the experts who were present in the hall.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This young man had been so fierce and arrogant earlier but now he was begging for mercy like a dog. The fact that a man like him not only possessed a supreme treasure like the [Purple Gold Divine Dragon Armor], but also claimed to be the descendant of a martial Emperor of the Human Race, was an insult to the martial way and to the supreme treasure of the Human Race. Those who lacked the spirit and the will of the martial way were not fit to become martial artists.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You can't kill him. You just can't. Stop right now," Ou Wuji cried out in alarm and rushed out from the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both his arms transformed into dragon claws and they gripped the [Purple Gold Divine Dragon Armor], then slowly exerted his dominance and forced the armor to submit to him. The purple divine dragon king transformed into a purple-gold dragon ring and landed in his palm.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Aah…" Ye Chongsheng cried out in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mysterious force had suddenly appeared in his body and this force was attempting to restore his body. A drop of blood in his heart suddenly exploded and released the force of countless formations in an attempt to defend himself against the power of the [Blood Drinker Sword] and save his life. This was probably a protective force planted within his body by an unknown but terribly powerful character.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's no use." Ye Qingyu was determined to kill this evildoer. And at his mental command, he activated the purple Emperor qi in the [Blood Drinker Sword].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Puff! Puff!

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Chongsheng's body broke apart and a vast amount of blood splashed everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spirit was released from his body but he continued to struggle and beg for mercy. "I'm willing to do anything and be your slave. Let me go. The [Purple Gold Divine Dragon Armor] is yours from now on. Don't kill me…"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You should be an ordinary human in your next life because you lack the heart of a martial artist." The killing intent in Ye Qingyu's eyes never wavered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a voice rang out.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Young man, why must you kill everyone? You've gone too far."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A terrifying power appeared outside the mourning hall, and in spite of the ice seal that locked up the entire hall, everyone inside could sense how terrifying this force was. They were like ants that faced a divine dragon high up in the Nine Heavens, and they all trembled in the face of this power, gripped by an uncontrollable terror that rolled over them. Even their teeth chattered…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Quasi-emperor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was clearly the force of a Quasi-emperor.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ah, father… father, save me!" Ye Chongsheng was overjoyed and reacted like a drowning man who had just seen a lifeboat. He yelled frantically and his face twisted savagely once more as he looked at Ye Qingyu. "My father has arrived. Haha, you can't kill me now. You're doomed… Didn't you want to kill me? Weren't you acting all arrogant earlier? Come at me, come on. Hahahaha. An ant, you're nothing but an ant in front of my father, hahahaha!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A trace of joy finally appeared on Ou Wuji's panicked face.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was that person finally about to make his move?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he had better come up with a good explanation for the events that had unfolded today because he was the one who had tricked Ye Chongsheng to come with the promise that he would be a hero. If that person was enraged… He looked uneasily at Wei Wubing, who stood beside him. He waved his red-feathered fan, his expression calm.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rest of the foreign race experts within the hall were also pulled out of their reverie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They all looked at Ye Qingyu with pity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had just been one step short of success.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was indeed an unsurpassed genius of his time and he had shown himself to be invincible by crushing all who were present today. It was a pity that he had provoked a living Quasi-emperor. This was the end. No matter how astonishing his talents were or how powerful he was, it was impossible for him to truly challenge a Quasi-emperor. He might be almost as strong as a Quasi-emperor, but ultimately, wasn't one himself. As long as he was not an Emperor, he would be an ant in front of a true Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Second Deputy of the Demon Race also let out a sigh of relief.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was great. The chance for them to turn the tide had arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long as the Quasi-emperor attacked and killed Ye Qingyu, then they would be able to remedy the losses of their headquarters and also smoothly carry out the plans that they had laid out. Everything would be in the hands of the Demon Race thereafter.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almost all those who were present suddenly felt relief wash over them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Uncle Lin, who had been protecting Ren Xingyan, had turned very pale and started to tremble as despair filled his eyes. He had been by Ren Puyang's side for so many years, so he knew that it was impossible to challenge a Quasi-emperor, who were known to be invincible. No matter how powerful someone who was not a Quasi-emperor was, that person would still not be able to go up against a true Quasi-emperor.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And once Ye Qingyu perished, they were all doomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The headquarters of the Human Race would be reduced to puppets and Ren Xingyan would also definitely perish. Whatever Mister Ren Puyang had painstakingly achieved during his lifetime would be reduced to dust and all his efforts would have gone down the drain… Why were the heavens so cruel? And why were the heavens so cruel to the Human Race?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tears rolled down Uncle Lin's face as he was overcome with sorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only person who smirked coldly was the haughty young man, Lu Wei.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at Ye Chongsheng as though that man was a moron and thought scornfully,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Do you think you're the only person who has the right to call your parent? Haha, I can do that too…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;He obviously was not going to verbalize his thoughts since he was not prepared for what had happened earlier, but Ye Qingyu had already made all preparations before he showed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he expected, another voice that was equally powerful rang out with the same matchless and terrifying authority of a Quasi-emperor. This voice immediately overpowered the earlier frightening voice and suppressed its power as it said coldly.
