Thus, without anything to burn, it would naturally start to go out. Everyone within the representative station whose bodies were tainted with karma all caught fire. Those with a heavy karmic debt were immediately turned to ashes while those with an average karmic debt were also unable to withstand the terrifying flames and died from serious injuries. The weaker ordinary martial artists had low karmic debts and thus the burns that they sustained were not as serious. Nonetheless, they had also fainted, so even if they were not dead, they would not be able to last long either.</span></p>

When they saw the end result, those who sympathized with Ye Qingyu let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's such a pity. This young man is definitely a remarkable talent. If he survives past today, he could go on to achieve great things in the future. He was a rare talent amongst the Human Race but now, he is bound to be killed by his fellow humans, the Black Moon Divine Palace."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're right. Indeed, it's remarkable he was so powerful considering that he was born in such a lowly domain. He must have been blessed with great fortune, but that aside, his innate talent must have been equally extraordinary. It's such a pity that he could not rein in his brashness and that he allowed his rage to get to him. After he revealed himself, it's just as though a tiger had descended the hills to enter the plains. He doesn't stand a chance now."</span></p>

The Black Moon Divine Palace has really gone too far this time. Why would they attack the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission when they were fellow humans? It is truly baffling."</span></p>

Didn't the Black Demon Race, the Phoenix Race, and Hurricane City all voice their support for Ye Qingyu? How can they just stand by and watch as this young man dies tragically? Won't they try to save him?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This is likely just a power game between the large forces. These large forces were probably never really in this young man's camp and were only using him to send a message to the forces backing the Black Moon Divine Palace. When they noticed how things were developing, they ultimately decided against helping Ye Qingyu."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yes, that makes sense. I felt that Ye Qingyu was a scheming fellow and tried to use his life to force the hand of the large forces who supported him. Unfortunately, he has overestimated his own worth and couldn't force the hand of the Black Demon Race, the Phoenix Race, nor Hurricane City. This one miscalculation will bring about his downfall."</span></p>

These experts greeted their friends, and as they spoke in low voices, they lamented the tragic fate of this young man. Those amongst the crowd who supported the Black Moon Divine Palace were all delighted by this development.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Haha, this kid was like an ant trying to topple a mighty tree and had ridiculously overestimated himself. Ultimately, he is just a peasant from a lowly domain and is as good as dead."</span></p>

Are they all blind? He killed close to a thousand experts within the representative station. This shows how cruel and ruthless he is. A troublemaker like that should have been exterminated earlier."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd was all abuzz, just like water coming to boil.</span></p>

However, its terrifying burning power remained, and the Void wobbled slightly as though it was about to melt. Surprisingly, most of the buildings remained intact. The buildings that were destroyed had mostly been destroyed by the experts who struggled in their last moments to fend off the flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many experts who had chosen to hide in the Void also revealed themselves.</span></p>

In particular, the legend of how he had managed to survive past the 18th district of the Black Demon Pool made him a walking target to many experts and forces. These ambitious and evil people had dared to attempt to assassinate the young master of the Sinful Pit and the Celestial Phoenix Maiden, so Ye Qingyu was nothing to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Ye Qingyu was doomed to die, then the treasures on his body would no longer belong to anyone. If they openly snatched his treasures now, they would not risk offending a terrifying figure like [Quasi-Emperor Xiaofei] either. This was a crucial moment and those who had been waiting for the standoff to come to an end would not sit by idly while the Black Moon Divine Palace helped themselves to his treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gradually, many experts from the various races who possessed extraordinarily powerful auras soundlessly inched their way toward the [Black Moon Pentagon Immortal Trap Foundation]. None of them spoke but their intent was clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Master Zhu sensed that danger was approaching.</span></p>

Zhong Yuan's gaze was as sharp as a knife as he looked at the figures who crept toward the formation. He shot the crowd a warning look as he said, "The plan we have laid out to kill Ye Qingyu was not formulated by the Black Moon Divine Palace alone. The forces who lent their support to this plan are stronger than you could ever imagine, and even the Black Moon Divine Palace would not be eligible to take the treasures from this troublemaker. Everyone, none of you can afford to get yourselves involved in this. If you don't wish to die or for your families to be ruined, please leave now."</span></p>

My family and friends are all dead and if I can't obtain the rare elixirs from this troublemaker, I will be dead in a few days. Why would I be afraid of vengeance? Hehe…" Someone let out a frightful cackle. His aura was terrifying and he was not weaker than Great Saint Zhong Yuan, but death qi circled his body. It was clear that this was a powerful expert who was reaching the end of his lifespan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You're right. Hehe, we can't give this golden opportunity up, we might never have the chance again…" someone else cackled. His laughter was as bone-chilling as the sound of a Night Owlet monster and his aura was equally powerful. His figure was hidden within a grey mist that obscured his features but it did not hide his ghastliness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

The attacking force was extremely powerful and the black web radiance quivered. The person who had attacked was extremely powerful and was at the Great Saint level.</span></p>

In an instant, the [Black Moon Pentagon Immortal Trap Formation] faced attacks from all directions and the five Saints who had been reinforcing the formation turned pale as blood flowed from their mouths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This formation had the ability to trap the enemy within it but it was susceptible to attacks from the outside. Most importantly, those who had attacked the formation were all extremely powerful and none of them were weaker than the five Saints. Since these people had ruthlessly attacked the formation with the intent of destroying it, the force from these attacks was not something the five Saints could deal with.</span></p>
