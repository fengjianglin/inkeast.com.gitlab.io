 <p>Chapter 351 - Training Camp</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu understood.</p>
 <p>These youngsters should be the young elites and masters selected from the army corps that Dugu Quan mentioned?</p>
 <p>The moment Ye Qingyu walked into the hall, he felt a powerful repressive force.</p>
 <p>The mysterious formation found all over the metal walls across the hall could greatly compress the yuan qi of a martial artist. Under such an environment, the strength of yuan qi will be compressed to roughly a third of the normal level, and the gravity rune formation above the ground raised the gravity of the hall by about 10 times. If an average person entered here, they would most likely be crushed to death by their own body weight.</p>
 <p>In addition to gravity, there were other kinds of strange forces filling the room.</p>
 <p>“It seems that the formations densely covering these walls were definitely created by the hands of a real martial arts master, and almost simulate the the force of the Heaven and Earth. To train under such an environment is really too harsh and demanding. It is likely that only the most determined people would be able to barely succeed?”</p>
 <p>This was a training camp for high level Spirit spring experts.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu instantly made such a judgment.</p>
 <p>A dozen pair of eyes were instantly cast upon Ye Qingyu as he entered.</p>
 <p>Some of the young experts, while training, were studying Ye Qingyu, their gaze cold and picky, like they were choosing goods, and with an undisguised intent to battle him.</p>
 <p>“Wow, another one!”</p>
 <p>Someone whistled.</p>
 <p>The young man with long fiery red hair also stopped what he was doing.</p>
 <p>He grasped the weapon that was spinning wildly, and looking at it again not that it was stationary, it was an electric fan-like spiritual weapon formed from ten giant sharp swords. This young man’s way of training was to constantly strike at a formation target through this crazily spinning fan. This required immense strength, eyesight and courage to achieve the unity of the mind and body, because if the punches were slightly slower, his arm would be twisted in the blade fan.</p>
 <p>This was a Spirit level blade, if one’s strength was a little lower, their arm would be chopped off on the spot.</p>
 <p>“Hey, do you want to come and try it?”</p>
 <p>The red-haired young man pointed to Ye Qingyu, between his forehead was full of provocative intent.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu ignored him.</p>
 <p>He slowly adapted to the chaotic state and the environment of the training camp. While constantly glancing around, he came to the hall on the left side of the room, walked in, and saw a few people that were sitting crossed legged on stone beds harmonizing their breathing and fluctuating their qi, next to them were more than 10 empty stone beds.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu casually chose a stone bed and was about sit down, when suddenly——</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The wind raged furiously.</p>
 <p>On the opposite bed was a teenager sitting cross-legged, clad in a black combat outfit with his hair loose. His eyes suddenly shot open, punching out, directly forming a transparent fist seal in the air. His five fingers were clearly visible, bringing a fierce qi similar to swords and blades, coming straight for the front of Ye Qingyu’s face.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu swiftly sidestepped to one side, avoiding the fist seal.</p>
 <p>The blue fist seal exploded when it slammed into the metal wall behind, making a huge thud.</p>
 <p>“That bed is mine. You, roll aside,” the black-robed teenager said coldly.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu indifferently got up, shrugged his shoulders, and sat on another bed.</p>
 <p>He was not afraid of this black-robed teenager, but he just felt that before he has a clear understanding of the situation here, there was no need to get into a fight with people. Moreover the reason Ye Qingyu came here was to enhance his strength, he did not want to attract too much attention.</p>
 <p>“Hah, terrified thing.”</p>
 <p>A scornful voice came from the doorway.</p>
 <p>A youngster more than two meters in height, body hair thick like a bear, his arms folded in front of his chest, was looking at Ye Qingyu and sneering, his copper-like eyes were full of disdain.</p>
 <p>“Thought they would fight, who knew a terrified bun came, so boring.” Behind the giant youngster was a lazy-looking handsome teenager with pale yellow hair, yawning, poking his head out to take a look and boredly retreated back inside.</p>
 <p>The several young experts that were standing at the door watching the scene also started to disperse.</p>
 <p>But the people’s gaze revealed more of a contempt when looking at Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu pretended as though he did not see this.</p>
 <p>He sat by the bedside, carefully examining the surrounding environment, stretched out his hand and pressed on the metal wall of the bedside, feeling the surging force of formation in the walls, he roughly had an understanding of the level of energy here.</p>
 <p>Through this, he counted the numbers carefully.</p>
 <p>Including himself, the training camp currently had a total of 18 people. If Dugu Quan is not wrong, then that means there are two people that had not yet come to report to the military. In this group of 20 people, he was considered as already one of the people that reported relatively late.</p>
 <p>Coming out into the hall and casually getting familiar with the variety of cultivation equipment, Ye Qingyu quickly discovered that these weapons and equipment were designed and made by some very talented people. To him, these were of no use because since his trip to the [Formation Sovereign] temporary imperial residence and the refining of his body by the thunder and lightning, Ye Qingyu’s level of strength was comparable to many high level Bitter Sea stage experts and was far beyond that of the young experts of the same age or same cultivation level. These equipment were not up to his cultivation needs.</p>
 <p>Bored, Ye Qingyu left the training camp, taking a stroll around the 55th floor.</p>
 <p>From the outside, it could be imagined how enormous the inside of the military building was, but in the inside, one would still be shocked by its scale. The lapis lazuli paved corridor was like a cobweb, and training camps and a variety of business office areas were everywhere. Ye Qingyu was almost lost inside. He roughly estimated that the entire 55th floor area was over one thousand acres. This was too inexplicable.</p>
 <p>His consciousness expanded.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu instantaneously discovered that there were dozens of overbearing auras present in the building, just like a sky fire pillar in the darkness. There was evident display and fluctuation of their spirits, only to be seen from a Bitter Sea stage expert of profound cultivation.</p>
 <p>One of them was on the 55th floor.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu felt a chill running down his spine.</p>
 <p>The military headquarters buildin was indeed a land of hidden dragons and crouching tigers, not to be underestimated.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, when he came to report this time, he did not take the troublemaker silly dog Little Nine. Otherwise, with his temper, it was likely that before a few days had past, the whole military building would have been turned upside down. And if the top experts of the military was angered, it may really be quite troublesome.</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, Ye Qingyu suddenly felt a tinge of regret that he did not tell Lin Baiyi to closely watch the silly dog and not let this guy run around in the imperial capital.</p>
 <p>Wandering around by himself, he was eventually bored.</p>
 <p>Returning back to the training camp, Ye Qingyu sat crossed-legged on his bed and began to cultivate using the nameless breathing technique, harmonizing his breathing and transporting qi.</p>
 <p>Now, the most important thing was to make use of the time and thoroughly liquefy the yuan qi in his body, to really grasp the power of the Bitter Sea stage.</p>
 <p>While operating the nameless breathing technique, Ye Qingyu once again felt the majestic energy of the Bitter Sea stage flowing endlessly toward himself, which was exactly the same as when he was training at the [Medicine Hut] before. He felt as though his entire body was soaked in an ocean of yuan qi.</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t seem to be because of the special location of the [Medicine Hut], regardless whether it’s the [Medicine Hut] or the military headquarters building, it is the same...”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu thought.</p>
 <p>What was the reason for the effectiveness of the nameless breathing technique, to increase so many times in the Snow Capital?</p>
 <p>He had tried several techniques before to cultivate qi, and the result was that the other methods did not produce such a change, only the nameless breathing technique had such an effect.</p>
 <p>He remained puzzled after pondering over this a hundred times.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu finally gave up thinking about the strange phenomenon.</p>
 <p>In any case, the change was beneficial to him.</p>
 <p>For the whole night, Ye Qingyu spent his time transporting qi and harmonizing his breathing.</p>
 <p>It was the first time Ye Qingyu shared a room with so many people. While training, he could not help being on the alert for the changes in the surrounding environment, and also quietly setup a formation at his bedside.</p>
 <p>Most of the young experts were also evidently very uncomfortable with the resting environment.</p>
 <p>Outside the training hall, some people had not slept all night to practice. The booming noises never stopped.</p>
 <p>The second day, a middle-aged military officer along with twenty soldiers brought them their breakfast -----meat of Spirit beasts that had been prepared with Spirit herbs and Origin crystal liquid wine prepared against a certain percentage. There were also all sorts of food that were rich in yuan qi. The richness of this feast made Ye Qingyu somewhat shocked.</p>
 <p>The other young experts that came earlier had become accustomed to the unusual arrangement, and grabbed every item of food and guzzled it down.</p>
 <p>The amount of food they were given, even a pig would be able to cultivate yuan qi after one month?</p>
 <p>The military headquarters was really generous.</p>
 <p>Although Ye Qingyu was shocked, he immediately began eating.</p>
 <p>There were some youths that had even begun fighting over the Origin crystal liquid. The officer to the side had evidently seen this far too many times. He brought the soldiers outside the great hall, and looked on interestingly. Evidently he had silently permitted such fights to occur.</p>
 <p>From having to fight over food with Little Nine, Ye Qingyu had developed a skill of showing a motionless expression while snatching food. He obviously snatched off a lot of good things, without arousing other people’s attention.</p>
 <p>When breakfast was over, it was the time of leisurely training.</p>
 <p>The military had not sent over an instructor yet.</p>
 <p>Lunch was even more fabulous than breakfast. Apart from all sorts of cultivating resources, they had also distributed a hundred [Mysterious Heaven Pellets] as well as two pounds of Origin crystal. This caused everyone to bitterly fight over this, resulting in an explosive environment. When the chaotic fight reached its end, no one paid any attention just who was the person who had stolen the two pounds of Origin crystal away.</p>
 <p>In the evening, there was unexpected news.</p>
 <p>The two youngsters that did not come to the military building to report, would never come——On their way to the Imperial Snow Capital, they ran into enemies and were killed.</p>
 <p>This news made Ye Qingyu extremely shocked.</p>
 <p>He did not expect that such a thing would happen.</p>
 <p>These young experts were the genius talents selected from the millions of the empire. Logically speaking, it should be the empire that should be giving them protection, and the average experts of the sect would never risk angering the empire to kill such a candidate.</p>
