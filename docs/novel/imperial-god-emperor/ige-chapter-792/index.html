There were illusory wave-like ripples flickering, which right away shrouded the mountain manor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No good.”&nbsp;</span></p>

The surrounding space, the sky overhead, and the ground below were locked down by a magnificent and vast force that was even more terrifying than the earth shaking formation that [Iron Heart Blood Saint] Yang Tianwu had set up on Fierce Beast Peak before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could not leave!&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of a sudden, several experts, clad in blood-coloured robes, of the Blood Taster Sect were darting out of the originally empty and silent walkways and forests of the mountain manor. They were wielding a variety of weapons and some even pushing a formation crystal cannon that aimed at Ye Qingyu who was at the courtyard gate. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, after such a long time, the fish finally took the bait.”&nbsp;</span></p>

With a contemptuous smile across her face, she came to the gate and looked at Ye Qingyu, as if she was watching a prey in a cage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Ye Qingyu, we meet again.” The Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect still had a silver veil over her face. Her figure was beautiful, her was legs were long and slim, her was waist slender, and her chest was full. Her entire body radiated a superior noble aura, exhaling orchid-like breaths, as she looked at Ye Qingyu with a smiling expression in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu didn't speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was carefully observing the situation around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After parting under the ancient parasol tree, I thought I would never see brother Ye Qingyu again in my life. I didn't expect brother Ye Qingyu to be so amazing to be able to come out alive of the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss after the Door of Life had closed. You really surprised this little sister.” There was smile in her voice. As if she was catching up with an old friend, her voice was extremely gentle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu sneered, “The fact that I am not dead seems to have disappointed you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You misunderstood.” The Saintess laughed. “I'm too happy.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Ye Qingyu also sneered. “Really? I came out of the 18th district alive, also with the Celestial Phoenix Maiden and the Little Princess of the Black Demon Race. We have exposed your lies on Fierce Beast Peak. The truth has been made known to the world. Your weak and shameless face has also been made clear to the thousands of experts on Fierce Beast Peak, even the [Iron Heart Blood Saint] of your Jade Pearl Sect also died... Now everyone knows that the Saintess is ruthless and full of lies, haha, I can't think of why you would feel happy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little child, you have a sharp tongue.” An expert of the Blood Taster Sect standing next to the Saintess grinned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person looked to be around forty years old, medium built, neither fat nor thin, and was dressed in a short armour. He had a hooked nose and long, narrow eyes. He had an imposing air, with visible blood killing intent around his body, like flames leaping around him. It was not known how many creatures he had slaughtered, his eyes were cold as ice, like two steel knives, looking up and down at Ye Qingyu. There was a hint of undisguised greed in his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu looked at this man, without the slightest fear, purple lightning darting around in his eyes. Facing the eyes of the other side, he similarly did not conceal his killing intent, and his imposing manner began to rage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was slightly surprised.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a junior of Ye Qingyu's age, no matter how good his aptitude or strength was, one would generally find his fiendish blood and qi unbearable, and would feeling inferior and fearful during a confrontation. He never would have thought that a youth from a lowly domain would be so powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He flew into a rage out of humiliation and was about to say something...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Qiu, stay calm.” The Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect opened her mouth and shook her head slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man, who was called elder Qiu, suddenly shut his mouth. He seemed to be afraid of the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Saintess turned her head to look at Ye Qingyu and smiled, “You ruined my plan. Of course it's not very good, but it’s just a small matter and would not affect the overall situation. It doesn't matter. Our Jade Pearl Sect has countless experts like Yang Tianwu. His death could draw out a Quasi-emperor, it is worth it, hehe...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu did not respond.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to his observation, the Saintess's expression was calm and indifferent, and did not seem like she was pretending to be relaxed. In other words, in her view, even though her reputation was ruined and she had provoked the two super forces - the Black Demon Abyss and Phoenix Race, these were still only minor matters.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This... who gave her so much confidence and courage?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Logically speaking, it would be a bit of a struggle for a Jade Pearl Sect to at the same time face the retaliation of both the Black Demon Race and the Phoenix Race, and she should not be so calm. Moreover, because of the death of Yang Tianwu, the Jade Pearl Sect had a grudge with an invincible existence like [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei].&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The situation is very bad, how could the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect be so calm?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu felt that, beneath what appeared to be a balanced surface, there might be too much hidden information that he did not know.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He continued to listen to the Saintess, “Brother Ye Qingyu, when I was under the ancient parasol tree, I also said that I very much admired your talent and willpower. A lot of mediocre people will judge others based on background, and would look down on people from lower domains like brother Ye Qingyu. They think they are superior, but are in fact stupid. Only I know of brother Ye Qingyu's true potential and strength. As long as you and I become friends, stand on the same side, then there will be a chair for you around the table behind me, also a seat of honour. The matters of the domain rating can easily be dealt with, you and I do not have to be in a state of hostility. We can completely turn hostility into friendship, what do you think?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When this was said, the complexion of the people around him changed abruptly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially elder Qiu of the Blood Taster Sect and Lord Ao of the Tianqian Sect, their faces flashed with an undetectable complex expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could tell that the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect was not deliberately deceiving him, but that there was a bit of truth within her words. But the problem was that, Ye Qingyu's view towards this woman was very bad.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu nodded, “Even if there are another three times, or thirty times, my answer will not change.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All right.” The Saintess smiled again, “I am always happy to see talents, but I especially pay extra attention to you, unfortunately... I am still very entangled, because the people around me want your treasures. I also am very interested in your cauldron, but I don’t want to kill such a genius. Since you are unable to tell good from bad, then the Heaven Wasteland Domain will most likely lose their most powerful martial artist ever in history.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only then that Ye Qingyu realized the reason why these people had set up this trap here today, arranged such a sealing formation, and sent people to deliberately say those words to him on the street to lead him to here. It was all for the treasures on him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Killing for treasure.&nbsp;</span></p>

Such a harvest was comparable to what major forces had accumulated over thousands of years. It would definitely arouse the jealousy of countless people. In other words, there was never a lack of outlaws and adventurers, even the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit, the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect and the Third Prince of the Kaiyang Imperial Court had encountered attacks as they departed from Fierce Beast Peak, let alone the fact that he was someone with no force to rely on.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Adding up these temptations, it was no wonder that these people could not resist.&nbsp;</span></p>

The plan today was most likely arranged by the fairy-like woman.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The methods of the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect also made Ye Qingyu tremble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But his complexion was still calm and indifferent.&nbsp;</span></p>

If I did not take a little precaution, and just came here because I heard some gossip on the street, then I would really be stupid, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath the silver veil, the Saintess narrowed her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>

Haha, you are not stupid, but are we stupid? Today we closed the door to slaughter the pig. I would like to thank you for coming here so fast to come offer the treasures in your hands, hahahaha...”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It should be said that the scheme today was the joint effort of many parties, and not a last minute plan. In the previous few days, countless channels had been mobilized and a steady stream of news was sent here to confirm that Ye Qingyu did not have any helpers with him. It was only after they had confirmed this fact that they decided to launched the attack. How would they give up just because of a few words from him?&nbsp;</span></p>
