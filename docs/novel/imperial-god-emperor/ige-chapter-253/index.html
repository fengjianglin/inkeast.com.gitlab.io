 <p>253 - The killing intent hidden within the White Ghost domain</p>
 <p>As he ingested the [Mysterious Heaven pellet] and cultivated at the same time, Ye Qingyu’s strength, grew exceedingly quickly.</p>
 <p>Three days later, his strength had again increased by another two Spirit springs, reaching the state of thirty two Spirit springs.</p>
 <p>And because Ye Qingyu continued to refine Pills, Ye Qingyu's control of this new power became more and more familiar.</p>
 <p>The third day, noon.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu ended his short cultivation training and headed towards the Hundred Herb Hall.</p>
 <p>If he was able to sell the Pill formula, and obtain fifty pounds of Origin Crystal, this was naturally the best result.</p>
 <p>But if the opposing party could not afford such a price, and relied on him to constantly refine the Mysterious Heaven pill, the cultivation path of cultivating while refining was also a rapid way of increasing his cultivation.</p>
 <p>No matter what, there must be a end result today.</p>
 <p>This matter, although it could not be said to be significant, would definitely have an effect on Ye Qingyu's future plans.</p>
 <p>During lunch time, Ye Qingyu once again gave advice and pointers to the Bai Yuanxing, Jin Ling'er and the others regarding their training.</p>
 <p>Jin Ling'er was already at the third stage of the ordinary martial level, growing extremely quickly. Li Ying and Li Qi had already entered into the first stage. Only Bai Yuanxing remained at the fourth stage without advancing any further despite being the first person to start cultivating and the oldest there.</p>
 <p>At this time, Ye Qingyu did not have any better ideas.</p>
 <p>Even if he used the [Mysterious Heaven pellet] on Bai Yuanxing, this would only increase the cultivation of a martial artist. It would not be able to help him completely get rid of his impurities in his body. Unless he could be like Ye Congyun and obtain a drop of blood from a peak level martial artist........However even this method was not fully guaranteed to succeed. Furthermore, Bai Yuanxing's cultivation heart, compared to Ye Congyun,was much, much, worse.</p>
 <p>Thankfully Bai Yuanxing seemed to have already accepted everything calmly, not becoming demotivated in the slightest. He still continued to painstakingly cultivate.</p>
 <p>After the meal, Ye Qingyu left White Herb hall, directly heading towards Hundred herb hall.</p>
 <p>There were still not many people on the streets.</p>
 <p>Everywhere seemed somewhat desolate.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu no longer cared.</p>
 <p>Lu Zhaoge injuries were already on the way of recovery.</p>
 <p>That represented, everything would soon be settled.</p>
 <p>But without knowing why, as he walked, Ye Qingyu suddenly felt something was not right.</p>
 <p>The surrounding environment was still the same.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu suddenly felt his heart thumping without any warning.</p>
 <p>As if something terrifying was about to happen.</p>
 <p>"Could this be a 'foreseeing'?"'</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was shocked.</p>
 <p>When one was deep into the path of the yuan qi martial cultivation, some people with extraordinary talent, would occasionally have a premonition if something bad or something great was about to happen. This was what was known as a 'foreseeing'. Fortune and misfortune was related to one's fate; the yuan qi martial path was the process of controlling your own fate in your own hands. In such a process, there was an indistinct relationship between these two things that could cause such a phenomenon.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could sense an inexplicable sense of uneasiness.</p>
 <p>When he first left White Horse tower, this feeling was not clear. But as he walked, this grew more and more clear. The yuan qi within his body was restless, with faint signs that it could not be suppressed any longer.</p>
 <p>"Could it be that Song Xiaojun is in danger?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu pondered.</p>
 <p>But once he thought about it more, this did not seemed to be the case. The silly dog Little Nine had already been sent to accompany Song Xiaojun. If there was anything wrong, he would definitely contact him at the first instant.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu shook his head.</p>
 <p>Perhaps he had mentally taxed himself too much during this period, and had a mistaken sensation.</p>
 <p>At this time, the Hundred herb hall was already not far away.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu headed into an empty alleyway nearby, to quickly don his snow white disguise and assume another identity.</p>
 <p>But the moment he stepped into the little alleyway, something happened.</p>
 <p>All sounds of the hustle and bustle of the streets, suddenly disappeared at that moment.</p>
 <p>There were strange markings on the air that appeared, then suddenly the alleway also disappeared. The original hundred metre long alleyway, had turned into a street that you could not see the end of. Everywhere was completely silent, as if the world had lost all sound at that instant.</p>
 <p>"A formation array!"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu heart was thumping, greatly alarmed.</p>
 <p>Someone wanted to act against him..</p>
 <p>He instantly realised what his uneasiness was caused by.</p>
 <p>And nearly at the same time, without giving Ye Qingyu any time to react, a maroon blade appeared from behind his back, piercing through Ye Qingyu's body at his chest.</p>
 <p>A faceless white figure, appeared like a ghost from behind Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>This dark red blade looked liked there was poisonous blood running through it. It was held in the hands of this figure.</p>
 <p>"Zhe Zhe Zhe Zhe…..."</p>
 <p>A sharp and piercing sound like the hoot of an owl, emitted from under the faceless white mask.</p>
 <p>This sound was like a muffled broken drum, vibrating, incomparably creepy.</p>
 <p>"So [The Leaf of Youyan], only amounted to such."</p>
 <p>The faceless white figure cruelly smiled, pulling out the maroon blade in his hand</p>
 <p>The fish hook on the spine of the blade had hooked onto the inner organs. In the instant it was jerked out, it would slice the inner organs of the opponent apart. From the perspective of the white figure, the painful shriek of the enemy as their intestines were destroyed, as their fresh blood came spurting out, was the most beautiful scenery.</p>
 <p>But---</p>
 <p>"Really"?”</p>
 <p>A calm voice, came from behind the white faceless figure.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's body that had been pierced, did not emit the slightest trace of blood.</p>
 <p>Pang!</p>
 <p>With a light sound, the pieced body, suddenly transformed into a white silhouette as if it was white mist, turning into a indistinct figure.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's true body had disappeared.</p>
 <p>"What?"</p>
 <p>The faceless figure suddenly felt apprehension.</p>
 <p>His figure suddenly moved, running forward madly, wanting to widen the distance.</p>
 <p>But at the same time -------</p>
 <p>"Aaaaaaaaaa………….."</p>
 <p>There was a noise that was icy and emotionless, as if it was making a mockery of life.</p>
 <p>A hard to describe killing intent, as if it was real, pierced into his skin, rumbling.</p>
 <p>Out of thin air, in all four of the surrounding directions, pale ripples flickered. Icy cold sounds of mocking laughter emitted from the white boxes that appeared. Within these four boxes, there were faint mist figures that shot through space as quick as lightning, striking out.</p>
 <p>The aim of these killing attacks was namely the faceless white figure.</p>
 <p>An icy killing intent, emanated throughout the air.</p>
 <p>A cold and sharp power, instantly smothered the white figure.</p>
 <p>In but the time of a spark, countless terrifying blade wounds had appeared on the white figure. His skin slitted open, exposing his flesh and the white frost was like a curse, entering through the countless small cuts and wounds into his body.</p>
 <p>"This......what is this battle technique?"</p>
 <p>The white figure said in an dumbfounded and angry howl.</p>
 <p>"A killing technique."</p>
 <p>The calm voice stated.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's figure that had disappeared, suddenly appeared next to the white silhouette.</p>
 <p>HIs white clothes were like jade, his hair like a waterfall.</p>
 <p>On his body, just where was the sign of any injury?</p>
 <p>Without waiting for the white silhouette to react, two six pointed translucent snowflakes the size of a lid of a saucepan, shot out from Ye Qingyu's palm. As quick as lightning, it cut towards the white figure.</p>
 <p>Blood spurted.</p>
 <p>The white silhouette scrambled backwards hurriedly. With a white flash, it disappeared.</p>
 <p>The next instant, it appeared twenty metres away.</p>
 <p>"Good, good. I didn't imagine [The Leaf of Youyan] would know such exquisite assassin techniques......" The white figure laughed creepily, as if something sticky had covered his entire face. Although he had no expression, but one could still discern the cruel and poisonous intent emitting from his mouth. Icily, "These are not the assassination techniques from within the army, could it be that you are the successor of some sect?"</p>
 <p>"Who are you? Why have you come to kill me?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not answer his question, his gaze like a sword as he countered with his question.</p>
 <p>"Tut, tut, a retarded question. Could it be that you don't know, just how many people want to kill you within Youyan pass? Being in the spotlight has its consequences. Do you really imagine that Youyan pass can protect your worthless life, kekekeke....."</p>
 <p>The white silhouette laughed mockingly.</p>
 <p>He pulled out the snowflake that was embedded in his abdomen and left shoulder, and smiled sinisterly. "In a direct battle, the sects cannot be compared to the army. But in terms of plot and stratagem, the sects are incomparably stronger. The history of Snow country is not even as long as the sects. For you to have offended the sects, you are definitely dead. If you don't die this time, there'll be a next time, and a time after that, kekekeke......you were lucky today, but next time I'll come to assassinate you again. Until you see your inner organs being cut into pieces by me, until you see all your intimate people dying in front of you....."</p>
 <p>"You think I would give you a chance to leave alive?" Ye Qingyu laughed mockingly.</p>
 <p>The faceless white figure voice was sinister: "This is not up to you. If I want to leave, with your cultivation, you can't stop me......In this white ghost formation, there is nothing that can halt my advance."</p>
 <p>This was the basis for his self confidence.</p>
 <p>Therefore when he failed at his first moment, he did not leave instantly.</p>
 <p>For an assassin this was the greatest taboo.</p>
 <p>But in truth, it was because he could not just leave. A opponent that he originally thought he could casually kill like a chicken, had injured himself. He wanted to use words and speech to leave behind psychological doubt in his enemy, to plant a seed for the next assassination.</p>
 <p>"Really? I fear you are too overconfident."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu knew he could no longer get any more information out of him, so he showed no mercy.</p>
 <p>His figure, suddenly became pale, turning into a human shape figure of white mist.</p>
 <p>"En?"</p>
 <p>The white silhouette instinctively felt danger.</p>
 <p>At this time, he was shocked to discover, that unknown to him when, there had always been a pale and indistinct fog next to him.</p>
 <p>Xiu!</p>
 <p>When Ye Qingyu's figure, disappeared from far away, this deathly silent and motionless white mist, suddenly became alive. The mist flowed, transforming into Ye Qingyu's true body.</p>
 <p>Sometimes fake and sometimes real, it was hard to discern.</p>
 <p>Xiu!Xiu!Xiu!Xiu!</p>
 <p>Countless ice crystals exploded.</p>
 <p>The snowflakes on his palm were translucent and sparkling, as if they were sprites.</p>
 <p>Snowflakes were originally one of the most breathtakingly beautiful works of art of the natural world, it was enough to cause someone to be entranced by it. But when they shot out, fast enough that it tore out river like fractures in the air, such beautiful flowers of the snow became one of the most terrifying and fatal killing weapons.</p>
