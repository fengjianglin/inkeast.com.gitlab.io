And when its body was gradually revealed, everyone could see clearly that it was a massive turtle. The body was several thousands of meters, like it was wandering in the sea, seemingly slow but in fact the speed was very fast. Within seconds it appeared in the sky above the foothills. Vaguely, on the jade green turtle shell, there stood hundreds of figures, all different in size, and were not entirely human.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is the people of Sky Demon Palace.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Among the Demon Race experts on its back, there absolutely must be a palace master level expert of the Sky Demon Palace there.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd broke into clamorous discussion.&nbsp;</span></p>

As a result there was not as big of a difference between the Human Race and the Demon Race. Going after advantages and avoiding disadvantages was the common choice that all races made.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the discussion of the crowd, it seemed that Sky Demon Palace was considered a powerful demon sect in Clear River Domain, and war had broken out between them and another demon clan– the Demon Spider Race. This had occurred several times before, and they were their mortal enemy. It was also expected that they answered to Greater One Sect’s invitation and came to them to participate in this Sword Storm meeting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>

The leader was a dragon-headed expert in purple gold armour, exhibiting a terrifyingly imposing manner. The crowd had already recognized him, it was the fifth palace master of Sky Demon Palace, Spiritual Master Long Jiao. He was also one of the strongest experts of Clear River Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the Greater One Sect, Great Hua Peak’s peak master personally came to welcome him, leading all people of Sky Demon Palace over to the Greater One Peak.</span></p>

A silver solitary boat floated over. Although the solitary boat only had two figures, but the imposing manner was not at all inferior to that of the Nangong family and the Sky Demon Palace before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the peak master of the eight great peaks of Greater One Sect came to greet them. His attitude was very respectful as he led the solitary boat to Greater One Peak.&nbsp;</span></p>

The sect master of every generation of Heaven Devastator Demon Sect calls themselves Heaven Devastator Demon. This sect’s strength is unfathomable. If it was not for the fact that there is little people in the sect, and only one master and one disciple, the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect could even claim the title of the strongest sect of Clear River Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the solitary boat, a black-clothed proud figure could be seen. This had sparked discussion among the crowd, which was much more loud and heated than when the experts of the two major forces appeared. Concerning the evaluation of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect, there was different appraisal in Clear River Domain, but there was one thing that was certain; which was that the sect was very terrifying. The sect master of each generation was close to invincible, its strength had obtained recognition from all forces. In Clear River Domain there was a saying, as long as the number of disciples of the Heaven Devastator Demon Sect exceeded 100, it could become the strongest sect within Clear River Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu also lifted his head to look at the solitary boat heading to Greater One Peak like a singular cloud.</span></p>

He seemed to have seen the figure before, but was unable to be certain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One master and one disciple? This sect... hmm, seems interesting.” Even Old Fish surprisingly showed a bit of interest.</span></p>

All were the finest pure jade. Ye Qingyu really had splurged a lot on these jade.</span></p>

The Origin crystals that he could exchange with merely one drop of God-level Origin liquid in the jars in the stone chamber of the underground Moonlight Immortal Palace were enough for Ye Qingyu to live extravagantly for half a year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before coming to Greater One Sect, Ye Qingyu had already discussed a lot of countermeasures with the Old Fish.</span></p>

Like meeting someone who understood each other’s inner thoughts, they produced many brilliant ideas.</span></p>

If we want to make a disturbance we need to be more cautious, but many people also may not necessarily really protect Greater One Sect. As they say, ‘too many people, too many ideas’. Once everything was throw into disorder, some people will inevitably take advantage of the situation, then at that time it will surely be very chaotic.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu carefully thought about the holes in the plan, and was not anxious at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

The odd job worker disciple area at the foothills was beautifully illuminated, a rune spirit lamp was floating in the void, illuminating the entire foothills just as though it was daytime, and the visitors from all across Jianghu did not lower their voices because of the arrival of night, but was instead celebrating wildly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because the people who had come here were not all the same race, not all were friends. There were some small factions that were enemies, and every time they ran into each other, it inevitably started a conflict.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was said that during the daytime, there had already been dozens of brawls. Fortunately, thanks to the Greater One Sect disciple’s quick response, large-scale casualties were prevented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was evident that these people from the middle and lower class martial world, who had rude and rough behaviour, were causing headaches to the high, mighty, and arrogant Greater One Sect disciples. And it was inevitable that their manner of speaking was not very friendly to them when dealing with such situations.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without saying anything further he pulled Ye Qingyu out. Saying in a complacent voice, “Success depends on the right time, and favourable geographical and social conditions, going blindly by yourself is incorrect. Come, come, come with me, Master will introduce some friends to you, haha...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu stared at him blankly, thinking that someone had been tricked by this unreliable old man again?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A delicious smell of meat drifted across, along with a strong aroma of wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three men were sat around the bonfire, one of whom was the weirdo Liu Shaji that he had met in the daytime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sat beside Liu Shaji was a tall square-faced man, with steel needle-like sideburns and messy grass-like hair, a lion nose and wide mouth, blade-like eyebrows and leopard-like eyes. With one glance it was obvious that he was a fierce character. His clothes were ragged, with more than ten patches of varying sizes. The weirdest thing was that even the crotch of his trousers was patched. How was that worn down that it required patching? But the colour of his clothes seemed very clean, though his hair and beard were both messy. An orange wine gourd half the size of a person was held in his arms. The wine gourd was opened, and an aroma wine fragrance was being released. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And sat opposite of Liu Shaji was a pale-faced scholar who looked over 20 years old. His facial features were extremely delicate and scholarly. He was the kind that could make many women shriek and faint with a slight smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This handsome scholar wore a white silk robe and a scholarly hat, long strands of black hair hanging down to his shoulders, and on his forehead he wore a flawless purple jade. There was a long sword along with its beautiful sheath inserted into the grass in front of him. When the rune spirit lamp and the moonlight shone onto him, he exuded an astonishing charm, which attracted the eyes of countless people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu could not see through the strength of these three people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Around the surroundings of the bonfire, there were some who were watching from afar, but evidently dared not come near, and seemed fearful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Old Fish dragged Ye Qingyu over, laughing, “Have you seen, this is my disciple Tian Huang, what do you think? I did not exaggerate, right? He is handsome and talented. Hahaha, the revitalization of my Thunder and Lightning Sect depends on my obedient disciple. Someday he will be able to move unhindered across Clear River Domain... Come here, my good boy, quickly pay respect to your Uncles.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu, “...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Uncles, these three guys are about the same age as me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little brother you finally showed up, come drink, Brother Hu has some good wine in his gourd.” Liu Shaji showed the same revolting behaviour as Old Fish, a born socializer, and laughing and greeting him the moment he saw him, as though he and Ye Qingyu had been friends for many years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Ye Qingyu had time to say anything, the bearded, square man also laughed, casually throwing the gourd over, “Please drink.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu’s complexion took on an abrupt change, slightly raising his hand into the air and catching the huge orange gourd floating over with the palm of his hand. He could feel a violent force rushing up his arm, as though an immemorial sacred mountain was crushing down at him. This man’s strength is frightening, he clearly is not an ordinary person, why was he placed in the odd job worker disciple area?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he did not show the slightest change in expression, exerting force towards his palm, and received the gourd in an effortless manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The square faced man’s eyes flashed a hint of surprise in response, and laughed, “Good, indeed impressive, you’re qualified to drink a mouthful of I, Great Thief Hu Bugui’s wine.”&nbsp;</span></p>
