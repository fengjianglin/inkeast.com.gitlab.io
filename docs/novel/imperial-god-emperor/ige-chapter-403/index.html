 <p>Chapter 403 - White Hair, White-Clothed Beauty</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu cast a glance over at her, saying to himself: ‘I should be the one asking what is going on. Before this, I do not know about the existences of what Aunt Han or Aunt Heng, but now your Aunt Han is letting me into the bamboo grove. How would I know what is going on?’</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu also believed in what Xing’er had said.</p>
 <p>The little princess did not intentionally take him here for his memory to be read.</p>
 <p>This was the trust he had in her.</p>
 <p>“The one playing the zither just now, was that your Aunt Han?” Ye Qingyu asked while walking along.</p>
 <p>Yu Xiaoxing hastily nodded. “Of course it’s her, besides Aunt Han, in this world, who can play the [Demonic Zither] to this level... However, I don’t know why, but today Aunt Han seems a little different from usual. Once you enter the bamboo forest, you must speak carefully. If you anger Aunt Han, no one in this world can save you.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s footstep abruptly stopped. “Then, can I not go?”</p>
 <p>“No.” Xing’er jokingly smiled. “It’s too late now.”</p>
 <p>“Fine.” Ye Qingyu stroked his face, saying, “Luckily I have a not-bad-looking face, so I should not annoy her... Hey, I said, you’ve been pushing me into the fire pit all the time today. Is there some deep-seated hatred between the two of us?”</p>
 <p>Yu Xiaoxing bent forward with laughter.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that the little princess was certain that Ye Qingyu was really not angry at her.</p>
 <p>She was a little moved. Clenching her teeth, she replied, “Don’t worry, no matter what happens today, even if I risk my life, I will protect you.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu shot a look at her, “Why is it that the more you say it, the more I feel I’m doomed? I feel like a prisoner going to the execution grounds...”</p>
 <p>While speaking, they had entered the bamboo grove.</p>
 <p>From the outside it seemed like a little bamboo grove, but once one stepped inside, the green surging bamboo was like a forest, bamboo leaves connecting heaven and earth, moving up and down with the wind, and the sound of wind beating the bamboo leaves was like the crashing sea waves. The scenery and atmosphere was too beautiful.</p>
 <p>Following behind Yu Xiaoxing, one step seemed as though striding over hundreds of miles.</p>
 <p>Inside this bamboo forest, there were formation restrictions.</p>
 <p>In dozens of steps, they had crossed the endless forest.</p>
 <p>A dozens-of-meter-wide waterfall came crashing down from the mountains, like the Milky Way falling from the ninth heaven. It was the waterfall that Ye Qingyu saw outside the village, and at the end of the bamboo grove was a flying crag, relying on the topography of the mountain to stretch into midair.</p>
 <p>On the flying crag was a small bamboo pavilion.</p>
 <p>Inside the pavilion were flowers, tea, wine, a zither, a sword and people.</p>
 <p>Besides the graceful Aunt Heng, there was another slim elegant figure, her long hair snow-white like the moon frost, glistening under the sun, and through the hazy mist of the waterfall, he could tell that this woman was not old. She was sitting proudly on a bamboo chair as if she was wielding a long machete and riding on a horse, her manner was exuberant and heroic, holding a light yellow wooden seven-stringed zither, and drinking wine...</p>
 <p>The first impression the white figure gave Ye Qingyu was that she was not a quiet woman living here in seclusion, but an invincible sword hero, brave and heroic.</p>
 <p>Was this that Aunt Han?</p>
 <p>She was completely different from what Ye Qingyu had imagined before.</p>
 <p>He found it hard to believe that the stable and terrifying demonic sounds of a zither, as though it were carried by the cool breeze, came from such a bold and unrestrained woman. The person and the music were of two completely different styles.</p>
 <p>Xing’er brought Ye Qingyu over, stopping hundred of meters away from the bamboo pavilion.</p>
 <p>“Haha, Little Xing’er, why are you standing so far away? Bring your little boyfriend over,” a voice echoed out of the pavilion.</p>
 <p>What kind of voice was this?</p>
 <p>Her tone, which carried a hint of teasing, for some reason was subconsciously ignored by Ye Qingyu, and the instance he heard this voice, he could not help but have a strange thought coming onto his mind———</p>
 <p>What’s going on?</p>
 <p>It seems he had heard this voice before?</p>
 <p>Xing’er gently tugged at Ye Qingyu’s sleeve, winked at him, and then staggered forward. He could tell that the unruly princess in front of this Aunt Han was somewhat in awe of the white-clothed woman in the pavilion.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu followed behind.</p>
 <p>They arrived outside of the pavilion, when Xing’er stopped again.</p>
 <p>“This girl, we haven’t seen each other in only 10 years, you’re so distant to Aunt.” The woman in white rolled her eyes at Yu Xiaoxing, then very casually dropped the wooden zither to one side and grabbed a jar of wine from the bamboo table. She gulped down a mouthful of wine, an aroma came wafting out, laughed out loud, and casually threw the wine jar out the small pavilion.</p>
 <p>But this jar of wine was not thrown at Yu Xiaoxing.</p>
 <p>But thrown in the direction of the Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu raised his arm, and caught the jar of wine with a confused expression on his face.</p>
 <p>Even Xing’er who was next to him and Aunt Heng in the bamboo pavilion had a look of surprise on their face.</p>
 <p>Nobody thought that the white-clothed woman would throw a wine jar to Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>“Uh... drank a little too much today and was dizzy. I threw in the wrong direction, hahaha...” the white-clothed woman explained, ending in a loud hiccup, her long white hair flowing down like a waterfall of snow. She casually pulled her hair into a knot, all her movements were done in a kind of bold and carefree manner, and then glanced at Ye Qingyu, shouting, “Doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter I threw it wrong. Little fellow, what are you looking at? Hurry up and drink it, do I have to toast to you?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stood with a stunned look across his face.</p>
 <p>When the long white snow-like hair was pulled back, Ye Qingyu was finally able to see the appearance of the woman in white. If that Aunt Heng amazed Ye Qingyu with her smile, then this white as snow Aunt Han, truly made Ye Qingyu’s mind go a bit blank from her unique beauty.</p>
 <p>Even the most gorgeous rhetoric in the world cannot describe the delicate beauty of the woman in white. Ye Qingyu had met a lot of beautiful women, but had never seen such a beautiful face before.</p>
 <p>This face was so beautiful that it was almost sacred.</p>
 <p>It’s hard to believe that there will be such a beautiful face in this world if not seen with one’s own eyes.</p>
 <p>When Ye Qingyu first saw her white frost-like hair, he instinctively thought that, this Aunt Han should be quite old, but now he just realized that he was completely wrong.</p>
 <p>This was clearly a face that would forever stay as young as sixteen or seventeen years old.</p>
 <p>The pure aura that a maiden radiates was like that of a naive and pure fairy, completely uncontaminated with the slightest mortal aura. This kind of temperament should not match with that long white hair, but for some reason, when this face and temperament was really put together with the snow white hair, a breathtaking and dazzling beauty was produced.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu suddenly became a little awkward.</p>
 <p>He was foolishly carrying the jar, not knowing what to do for a moment.</p>
 <p>This was definitely not because of the beauty of the woman in white, but a very strange feeling.</p>
 <p>Standing in front of the woman in white, Ye Qingyu felt an unprecedented constraint.</p>
 <p>Somewhat nervous.</p>
 <p>Compared to facing a fierce person like Yan Buhui, he was much more tense.</p>
 <p>Yu Xiaoxing stretched out her fingers, gently poking him.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu suddenly came out of his trance, realizing something. He opened his mouth and inhaled, drinking a huge mouthful of wine in the jar. He immediately felt a delicate fragrance and warmth seeping into his heart and spleen, like he was walking on clouds like a fairy. The wine contained a majestic spiritual energy, just like origin crystal. Once the wine enters the mouth, it immediately transformed into a current of energy flowing to his four limbs and throughout the rest of his body.</p>
 <p>Good wine!</p>
 <p>It was absolutely not an ordinary wine.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was inwardly shocked.</p>
 <p>Such fine wine. Although he did not know what ingredients it was brewed from, if it was placed outside, many people would break their skull to fight over it. One drop could be worth thousands of gold!</p>
 <p>But...</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu saw that inside the small bamboo pavilion, across the bamboo floor, and dripping down from the clothes of the woman in white... were all large wine stains. It seemed that the woman in white treated the wine that can’t be bought for thousands of gold as the most ordinary coarse wine, splashing the wine everywhere. Ye Qingyu still remembered that just now, when this woman in white was drinking, she was carrying the wine jar backward and more than half was trickling down the collar onto her clothes and body.</p>
 <p>“Three mouthfuls.”</p>
 <p>The woman in white looked smilingly at Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>She suddenly seemed interested, wanting to make fun of Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>“Ah?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked very foolish.</p>
 <p>Yu Xiaoxing anxiously poked Ye Qingyu again. “Why are you standing there blankly, Aunt Han told you to drink another three mouthfuls. Hurry and drink, not even my father may be able to drink it... Usually you look very alert, why do you suddenly look so blank at such an important moment?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked absently, said “oh”, and began drinking.</p>
 <p>Yu Xiaoxing was completely infuriated at his indifference, stamping her feet.</p>
 <p>Aunt Heng who was in the pavilion also could not help laughing.</p>
 <p>That incomparably gentle smiling face that Ye Qingyu marvelled at before, enough to make him hold his breath for years, when next to the woman in white, was suddenly less colourful. The charm of the woman in white was masking up everything, even the stunning gentle smile of Aunt Heng had also lost its brilliance.</p>
 <p>When Ye Qingyu drank another three mouthfuls of wine, he felt a little dizzy.</p>
 <p>Back when Ye Qingyu was at Youyan Pass, he could drink jars of sorghum wine without getting drunk, but obviously this wine was not an ordinary wine. Even a top expert would get dizzy drinking it.</p>
 <p>The woman in white smiled, looked at Ye Qingyu. She rolled up her sleeve exposing the soft white skin of her arm that was as light as the touch of frost and as white as snow, and suddenly laughed loudly, “Hey, youngster, you’re going to be drunk... how about this, if you finish the jar of wine, then I’ll let you off for secretly listening to me playing the zither outside the bamboo grove...”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu, “.......”</p>
 <p>It was clearly you that was reading my memory with the zither sounds, how could you say I secretly listened in on you playing the zither?</p>
 <p>Utterly unreasonable.</p>
 <p>But under the situation of Yu Xiaoxing giving signals with her eyes to Ye Qingyu, so much so that she was about to hurt her eyes, Ye Qingyu ultimately obeyed instructions. He honestly lifted up the jar and finished in one breath the rest of the wine. He could not help but let out a drunken burp, as his knees weakened and his bottom impacted the ground.</p>
 <p>The wine was too strong——</p>
