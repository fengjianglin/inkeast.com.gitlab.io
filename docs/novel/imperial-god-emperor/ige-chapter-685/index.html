 <p>Chapter 685, Venerable Lord Ao</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Jiang Xiaohan couldn't help shuddering.</p>
 <p>When she saw Ye Qingyu coming towards her, she could not help but scream. She, turned around and fled. Her hair was disheveled, her pale face blood-stained, like a crazy woman screaming and running away in the depths of the Nine Serenities Palace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu came to a halt.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He drew a deep breath and slightly calmed down, his inner yuan recovering a little.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>To fight against the experts of an era with the strength of one person, even for him, was exhausting. He had almost consumed the majority of the yuan qi in his meridians.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu dragged the huge [Blood Drinker Sword] behind him. He treaded across the pile of bones and blood, and followed</p>
 <p>&nbsp;The darkness of the Nine Serenities Palace seemed like it could engulf all rays of light.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's eyesight could only see hundreds of meters away.</p>
 <p>Taking one step at a time, his pace was steady.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Being towed across the ground, the [Blood Drinker Sword] emitted a clunky sound of excitement and indignance.</p>
 <p>The collision between the blade and the ground produced a long line of sparks, flames sputtering and flickering indefinitely. The flickering light, contrasted against Ye Qingyu, who was like a deity on the Asura killing field. It added an awe-inspiring inviolability and invincibility to his aura.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally he came to the deepest part of the Nine Serenities Palace.</p>
 <p>A huge dark wall, like the end of the world, stood in the way of everything.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Jiang Xiaohan knelt down on her knees in horror, quietly beside the tall Brute King throne, shivering like a frightened chicken, with her head down and her long hair draped over her face. She did not even dare to take a deep breath.</p>
 <p>On the gold Brute King throne, a young figure was sat leaning to one side. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was a young man who looked less than twenty years old. There was not the slightest yuan qi fluctuating around his body, and his aura was very bizarre. His hair were scattered over both his shoulders, and he was dressed in a loose white robe, which the style looked like nightclothes, and without a strap around his waist. He was bare chested, which was glowing a strange white jade colour. He was ordinary in appearance, barefooted, and even his legs were exposed under the white robe. Propping his chin in the palm of his hand, he sat arrogantly on the throne and coldly looked at Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>That expression was like a demon god who dominated all living beings, looking at a bug that appeared in front of him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Really disappointing, it took so long for you to kill such trash.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The young man grinned.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As he was speaking, he slowly lifted his leg and very naturally stamped his barefoot on Jiang Xiaohan's bare shoulder, slowly rubbing with his feet. Towards such a humiliating assault, Jiang Xiaohang did not struggle at all, lowered her head and stayed motionless, letting the other side do what he wanted.</p>
 <p>A glimmer of puzzlement flashed in Ye Qingyu's eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You are Sky Demon old ancestor?” He slowly moved closer, stopping ten meters away.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu felt a dangerous aura from the strange and ordinary-looking young man, who was dressed in normal and casual clothes&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Sky Demon old ancestor?” The young man smiled. “Haha, that piece of trash calls himself the overlord of the Tianyuan era of the era of sects three thousand years ago in Heaven Wasteland Domain, but the little things that I ordered him to do, he actually screwed up. I am very disappointed with him. So I peeled his skin and tore his bones, made a new chamber pot with his skull. It’s quite good when you actually use it.”</p>
 <p>He was not the Sky Demon old ancestor?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was a little surprised.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His tone of voice was arrogant, but intuition told Ye Qingyu that the young man was not exaggerating just to scare people.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The past chaotic era of sects was also divided into different epochs, of which three thousand years ago it was called the Tianyuan era. Following the young man's reminder, Ye Qingyu immediately recalled that there was a period of time when there indeed was a very terrifying demon expert, known as the first genius of the Demon Race. He had moved unhindered across Heaven Wastelandfor six hundred years and was invincible, known as the Sky Demon. He had dominated an era. It turned out that the Sky Demon old ancestor who Ye Qingyu had been hearing about was that Sky Demon.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But such a tyrannical and powerful person like the Sky Demon was tortured by the young man.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu carefully studied him, and found it increasingly strange. His body exuded no vitality, and he could not even feel the slightest life force from him. He was just like a stone statue.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You are not from Heaven Wasteland Domain.” Ye Qingyu captured an information from the other person's words, “Which domain do you come from?”</p>
 <p>The young man grinned, but did not answer his question. He lifted his feet and directly stepped on the face of Jiang Xiaohan. “Listen you, this is your childhood sweetheart? Haha, this stupid and snobby woman is only good to play with. Throw her some food occasionally and she will be happy to let you fiddle with, you actually like this kind of woman?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s brows were drawn together in a frown.</p>
 <p>At that moment, he saw clearly that Jiang Xiaohan's face flashed a hint of sadness and indignation.</p>
 <p>But she still chose absolute obedience, and did not struggle in the slightest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu dragged his [Blood Drinker Sword] and walked towards the young man.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The huge [Blood Drinker Sword] body slightly quivered, a faint anger diffusing out from the body. The strange almost demonic blood markings flashed, closely covered the huge sword body. Every flicker was as though there was a mysterious heart throbbing, producing a faint killing intent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A sword cry was faintly discernible.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh, this is your demonic sword. It should be the one that killed the Spider Clan Prince.” Looking at the [Blood Drinker Sword], a tinge of strange colour flashed in his eyes, clearly he had great interest in the sword.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's footsteps halted.</p>
 <p>At this time, the astonishment in his heart had come to a great climax.</p>
 <p>From this young man's words Ye Qingyu clearly knew that the opposite side had found out a lot about him. Moreover this information was not at all superficial, but he had a clear understanding about what Ye Qingyu had done in the past, including how he killed the Prince of the Spider Race in Clear River Domain. It was evident that he had investigated a lot about him, and it was even clearer that the other side was definitely not from Heaven Wasteland Domain. It seemed that Yan Buhui's previous speculation was correct: there were other foreign forces behind the old monsters and Ancient Demons that were disrupting Heaven Wasteland Domain.</p>
 <p>Jiang Xiaohan, who had disappeared in the Battle of the Light City, was now attached to the feet of a foreign domain person, and it was clear that he was also from a foreign domain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This made Ye Qingyu extremely vigilant.</p>
 <p>It seemed that the activities of foreign domain forces in Heaven Wasteland Domain were far more frantic and deeper than they were on the surface.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And what was more astonishing was that the killing intent in Ye Qingyu's heart was increasingly fierce.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Since the foreign domain forces were so eager to reach into Heaven Wasteland Domain, then he must cut off all these hands completely, so that they feel the pain and will really behave.</p>
 <p>[Blood Drinker Sword] was slightly raised.</p>
 <p>The tip of the sword pointed straight at the Brute King throne.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not want to waste time talking rubbish and decided to act straight away.</p>
 <p>The tremendous sword body that looked blood-soaked was buzzing, the hair-like strands of blood glowed, as it detached from the sword body. It was extremely bizarre. A piecing sharp killing intent erupted like a mountain torrent, striking the opposite side.</p>
 <p>The young man kicked Jiang Xiaohan away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He rose to his feet slowly, with a contemptuous smile on his face. The sword qi and killing intent that came sweeping over like howling wind failed to even lift up his loose robe, and when he raised his hand slightly, a strange whirlpool the size of a toddler's palm appeared in his hands, instantly swallowing up all of Ye Qingyu’s strength.</p>
 <p>“It seems that your demon sword is just so-so. After a great battle, you have been worn out,” said the young man, shaking his head, “to tell you the truth, you have disappointed me...”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before his voice faded.</p>
 <p>A cold smile suddenly made its way across Ye Qingyu's face.</p>
 <p>In his hand, [Blood Drinker Sword] was raging again. A strange force came gushing out, and all of a sudden, the blood and bones of the old monsters that were killed, as well as the will and killing intent that pervaded the Nine Serenities Palace, all transformed into a current that poured into [Blood Drinker Sword].</p>
 <p>A vast and irresistible supreme power bloomed from the body of the sword.</p>
 <p>The entire Nine Serenities Palace shook under this power.</p>
 <p>The young man's pupils rapidly contracted and finally showed an expression of shock.</p>
 <p>However, opposite, Ye Qingyu had already launched his first sword strike.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Blood-coloured sword light skimmed through the void.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And then everything went still.</p>
 <p>The young man kept his hand in a lifting position, but his body had stiffened. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Incredible... haha... I see... this sword...”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He opened his mouth to speak, but the voice that came out had completely changed. It was like the impact of metal striking one another, very bizarre, somewhat hoarse, and similar to two pieces of rusty iron being rubbed together.</p>
 <p>A burst of spirituality quickly dissipated from his body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Then, the young man could not move his mouth again, gradually frozen, his white robe turned to ashes, and his skin that was originally glowing a jade-like luster rapidly dimmed. He gradually turned into a silver metal statue, his face blurred, his body oddly shaped, and with no sense of beauty.</p>
 <p>The process was incredibly bizarre, like a jade had lost its spiritual luster and become an ordinary stone.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu withdrew his sword.</p>
 <p>The expected scene of blood splashing did not appear.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was a little surprised, not expecting to see that under his sword, the mysterious and powerful young man would turn into such an ugly and bizarre metal statue.</p>
 <p>Could it be that this young man was just a statue?</p>
 <p>“You... even severed a doppelganger of the Venerable Lord Ao, you...” Jiang Xiaohan stared in wide-eyed disbelief, as if she had seen a ghost, and in this great shock, she had even forgotten her fear.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Venerable Lord Ao?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Is that him? &nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Ye Qingyu heard the name, a piece of information immediately jumped up in his mind.</p>
 <p>Among the great wide world, there were countless domains, thirty upper domains, three hundred middle domains, and countless lower domains, as well as a domain like Heaven Wasteland Domain, which had just generated the Central Domain Gate, and was just barely regarded as a lower domain of the lower domains. Among the three hundred middle domains, there was a domain called the Qian Yuan Boundary, with a history of more than thirty million years, and was ranked in the top ten of the three hundred middle domains.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There were countless strong martial artists in the Qian Yuan Domain, but there was only one sect, that is the Heavenly Stem Sect.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Heavenly Stem Sect had a long history, profound background, unshakeable status, and could be called a supreme martial arts sect.</p>
 <p>It was rumored that there were diverse disciples in Heavenly Stem Sect, including people from the Three Religions and Nine Schools, and from all races.</p>
 <p>And Venerable Lord Ao as well as three others, represented the four most talented descendants of Heavenly Stem Sect, known as Heavenly Saint Ao, one of the Four Saints of the Heavenly Stem Sect.</p>
 <p>Among the many information that the Immortal God Emperor Sect had given to Ye Qingyu, there were only two words about the Venerable Lord Ao.</p>
 <p>Extremely dangerous.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu originally thought that, given the current state of Heaven Wasteland Domain, it should not have captured the attention of such a mature domain, and would not come into contact with an existence like Venerable Lord Ao. However, he absolutely never thought that the tentacles of the other side had unexpectedly stretched into Heaven Wasteland Domain, and also knows him so well. It was obvious that it was not by coincidence——&nbsp;</p>
