 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 981 - Quasi-emperor Mushan</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu didn't respond. The [Blood Drinker Sword] in his hand had reverted back to its sword pill form. Then, at his mental command, a crimson ray of Divine Emperor sword will brushed past that Saint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment this sword radiance brushed past the Saint who had lost his composure, his body transformed into a ball of flames that gave off green smoke, then disappeared into the Void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These experts, including that handsome young man, were not from the Human Race and they had made repeated threats against himself and Hu Bugui, so they were obviously up to no good. Thus, Ye Qingyu didn't feel a single bit of remorse or guilt after killing these people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that he was in the [Sixth Limit] of the [Limitless Divine Way], his combat strength was equivalent to a higher Saint and his Divine Emperor sword will could overcome all obstructions, so killing these ordinary Saints was just a matter of one thought for him. Most importantly, the primeval laws of the universe were everywhere within the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor and its condition was restored to the ancient Fiendgod Age. Thus, whenever Saints of the current era entered this place, their cultivation would be suppressed and their combat strength would be greatly diminished; but Ye Qingyu had cultivated the [Fiendgod Title Chart] of the bronze book and to his own surprise after this battle, he realized that the [War God Sword Mantras] which Yu Xiaoxing had imparted him weren't affected at all. In fact, they seemed to become even more powerful in this primeval universal world. This surge in strength made him invincible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Retreat!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's go! We've got to let Quasi-emperor Mushan know that his younger brother has been murdered!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surviving Saints knew that it would be meaningless if they continued to battle and decided to retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rays of flowing light shot toward the main gate of the [Tusita Palace].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was shocked when he heard their comments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The handsome young man was the younger brother of a Quasi-emperor?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn't expected that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder that young man behaved so arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That also explained why during their battle earlier, he sensed that despite that man's powerful peak Saint cultivation, his astonishing combat technique, and his extraordinary divine spear, his ability to wield that weapon didn't match his cultivation stage. His inner yuan was mottled and irregular, as though his cultivation had been forcibly increased by an external power. It would make sense if his Quasi-emperor brother had helped him increase his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He suddenly felt a little worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn't realized that he would be offending a Quasi-emperor by killing that man earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It also seemed like this Quasi-emperor Mushan loved his brother very much. Otherwise, he wouldn't have spent so much effort and resources on that handsome young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were the thoughts running through his head but he continued to attack mercilessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [Blood Drinker Sword Pill] exploded like fireworks once more, transforming into dozens of beams of dazzling crimson Divine Emperor sword will splendor that hurtled out. They moved faster than these Saint experts and swished through the air to instantly kill dozens of Saint experts of the foreign race. Bursts of fiery flames exploded and quickly disappeared mid-air; this beautiful scene was formed from the disintegrating dried up corpses of these experts after the [Blood Drinker Sword Pill] absorbed their blood and inner essences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it wouldn't be easy to kill every single one of these fleeing Saints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite the power of the Divine Emperor sword will, three Saints of the foreign race managed to transform into flowing lights that then disappeared into the dark corridor outside the [Tusita Palace].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Quick, we can't afford to let them escape," Hu Bugui said urgently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had also overheard the conversation earlier so he knew that they absolutely couldn't afford to let those three Saints flee. Once Quasi-emperor Mushan caught wind of this news, no one would be able to bear the brunt of a Quasi-emperor's rage. The consequences would be dire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu shook his head slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn't intend to continue chasing after them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Forget it," he stopped Hu Bugui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui stopped and looked at Ye Qingyu in confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A Quasi-emperor is extremely remarkable. I'm afraid that Quasi-emperor Mushan had already sensed the death of his brother the moment I killed him so it doesn't matter whether or not we allow those Saints to escape," Ye Qingyu said with a smile. "However, now that we are in the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor, even a Quasi-emperor would be unable to arrive instantly. It wouldn't be easy for him to find us either, so we still have time."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That is true," Hu Bugui stopped charging forward but his face was still a little pale as he said, "But he is still a Quasi-emperor... If he really finds us, then... then..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui's face was still solemn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We weren't left with much of a choice either. His younger brother wanted to kill us so we couldn't possibly have stood there, waiting to be killed. Since we entered the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor to fight for treasure, we should have already prepared ourselves for the worst since this is a frenzied killing spree between Quasi-emperors. Once we chose to enter this place, we should bear the consequences," Ye Qingyu said calmly. "The worst we could do was to offend a Quasi-emperor and since we've already done that, things can't get much worse from now on. We just need to remain calm and alert so even if we are discovered by the Quasi-emperor, we won't necessarily be doomed."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words sounded a little too good to be true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui glanced at Ye Qingyu and was affected by his confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He suddenly felt his spirits lift at the thought of all Ye Qingyu's miraculous feats in battle thus far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha, brother Ye Qingyu, you're right. I, Old Hu Bugui, have traversed the entire Clear River Domain and have been through all kinds of situations. Hehe, so what if he's a Quasi-emperor? The worst that could happen is that we'll die. If we were to die, we shall face our deaths bravely; but if we manage to escape, we would become legends forever. Ha ha ha," Hu Bugui said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a secret realm of the Chaos Demon Emperor’s Reincarnation Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly thunder, fire, and wind howled together and the scene was as terrifying as the beginning stages of Chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A middle-aged man in a golden long robe walked in the midst of it all and looked as relaxed as though he was strolling through a beautiful garden. There wasn't any energy wave of divine splendor around him either but the energy waves of the destructive Chaotic forces that could instantly destroy Great Saints didn't seem to affect him at all. Once they came within a meter of him, they would instantly turn into smoke and become nothingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The ways of the Chaos Demon Emperor are indeed extraordinary. He even managed to reconstruct the scenes of the initial Chaos stage, long before any living thing existed. Unfortunately, there isn’t any Chaos Demon Reincarnation Scripture here, I can't believe my guess was wrong..." The middle-aged man shook his head with a small smile on his face. "Someone must have disrupted the divine secret, causing me to appear in the wrong area. This should have been the work of another Quasi-emperor. I guess that there are indeed many out there who are after the Chaos Demon Reincarnation Scripture, haha. It doesn't matter. The divine secret is constant and even a Martial Emperor would not be able to continuously disrupt the divine secret. I would be able to sense it at some point in time, then a fierce battle would definitely ensue."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man didn't seem upset at all that there was nothing in this secret realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His mental state was already at a perfect state, with no scars or cracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an energetic Quasi-emperor with abundant vitality and absolute confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I guess it is time to leave," he said as he stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the bright jade that he wore on his forehead suddenly cracked open with a bang and turned into crushed jade powder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Brother, you must avenge me... I refuse to admit defeat, I... really hate him," a hologram of the handsome young man howled like a vengeful spirit, formed by the crushed jade powder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man was stunned, then his emotionless face suddenly changed. "Brother..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The person who killed me is... Ye..." the hologram's face turned savage but it disappeared before it could complete its sentence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man stood rooted to the spot and a teardrop suddenly fell from one of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His tear traced a line down his face but turned into bright light mid-air, before it fell onto the ground. Then, it spread out and divine splendor exploded and transformed into laws mid-air. The destructive Chaos scene in this secret realm was instantly destroyed. The entire secret realm was immediately torn apart by one single teardrop...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He found himself in an ancient and majestic grand hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man stood in the middle of the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"My parents died early and my only family was my younger brother. I spent my whole life pursuing the martial way and had never properly guided him, resulting in him suffering in the mortal realm. I returned to my hometown thirty years ago after attaining the half-step to the Quasi-emperor realm and helped him extend his lifespan. I changed his physical body and blessed him with a cultivation of a peak Saint realm. I've always agreed to any request he made and even ordered Saints to be his men. I intended to make it up to him but instead, my actions have harmed him. He didn't have the sincerity to pursue the martial way but was given martial power. He ultimately brought about his own downfall..." After that tear rolled down the middle-aged man's cheek, he had reined in his emotions. He mused to himself and he was a little emotional but no longer sorrowful as he continued, "Brother, I forbade you from tagging along this time when the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor descended upon the land, but you insisted on coming... I've been stuck at the half step to Quasi-emperor realm for thirty years because the only crack in my heart for the martial way was my love for my only family. I couldn't bear to rid myself of this connection and planned to straighten out my heart for the martial way to truly attain the Emperor realm after your lifespan was exhausted. But you... Sigh, I guess the laws of the universe have their own plans. I was able to change your life for a short period of time but I couldn't change it for your entire lifetime. If the heavens want you dead, I wouldn't be able to prevent it either. I'll break the final familial bond you and I shared with this single teardrop. After I've avenged you, I would have nothing left to tie me to this world any longer."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he finished speaking, the universe reacted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Up above the grand hall, the laws of the universe were reversed, producing thunder and lightning as though the laws were responding to his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He tapped his fingers together and calculated, drawing on an mysterious technique to figure out some clues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strange splendor flashed in his eyes and a picture appeared in the Void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silhouette of a man in black hair and white robes gradually appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this picture only lasted an instant before it collapsed and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A look of surprise crossed that middle-aged man's face, "Hm? Who could the person who destroyed my Emperor Detection Technique be? Was the murderer of my young brother a Quasi-emperor?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He tried again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He tried countless times and his attempts all ended in failure. He was not even able to produce that white silhouette in the Void any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Forget it, his silhouette is enough. I'll definitely be able to find him once I see his face... Even if he has the protection of a Quasi-emperor, I'll annihilate him, his relatives, his friends, his men, his auxiliaries, his domain... all these will have to join my brother in his grave. Then, my heart for the martial way and I will become one. Once an Emperor rages, the heavens will be buried. When Li Xiaofei flew into a rage, he killed thirty thousand and annihilated ten domains. As a Quasi-emperor, I can do the same. No one will be able to stop my first rampage."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man scoffed and gave up on his attempts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He put his hands behind his back and turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His figure flashed with each step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After three steps, he completely disappeared from the grand hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
