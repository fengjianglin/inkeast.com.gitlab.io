 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the ground—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone within the defensive shield wore a complicated and anxious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Greater One Sect's current power and combat strength were unparalleled throughout the Clear River Domain, and it was only because of their implicit support that the Heaven Desire Demon Sect's attack on the Hundred Spirits Sect had gone so smoothly. Those words by the master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect were a warning, calculated to instill wariness into this mysterious newcomer, allowing him to retreat on his own accord. Everyone knew that whoever got on the wrong side of the Greater One Sect in the Clear River Domain would be doomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Would this mysterious expert leave out of fear of offending the Greater One Sect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were not sure, nor did they dare to hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon afterward, the answer became clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A voice rang out from the Void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hahaha… the Greater One Sect? Now that you mention it, I must say that I've been planning to visit the Greater One Sect to avenge the deaths of my friends. Since you have allied yourselves with such an evil sect, I'll collect some interest first." The person laughed powerfully and his laughter contained a strong heavenly authority, as though he was a fiendgod who had descended to earth, brimming with a righteousness that shocked everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as he spoke, another ray of divine radiance appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, most people could vaguely discern that the blurry figure was indeed punching out with his fists. His hands were curled into fists and when he punched out, a ray of divine radiance exploded from his fists. This fist radiance was like a divine radiance because it was so dazzling that it was like a Immortal dragon surging from the Ninth Heaven, releasing a roar so deafening that it sounded like an enraged dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The divine fist radiance tore the Void apart as it hurtled past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the black mist within this place was shattered and the clouds rolled furiously as though everything within this Heaven and earth was about to be destroyed by this dazzling golden radiance. It charged toward everyone from the Heaven Desire Demon Sect, full of power and brimming with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You… are going too far. Do you really think that I won't be able to take you down? You are far too arrogant… [Demon Blood Lotus Jade], block this!" The master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect yelled loudly and brought out his life weapon—the [Demon Blood Lotus Jade].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the mysteriously beautiful blood jade that was on his forehead. As blood-colored formations flickered and unfurled, it suddenly transformed completely into a gigantic blood lotus and the lotus formation bloomed open as though it was cut by the Chaos of the universe. This blood lotus protected the master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect behind it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blood light expanded and mournful ghostly howls raged angrily from within the [Demon Blood Lotus Jade], as though countless vengeful spirits were trapped within, struggling and twisting to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect had obtained this [Demon Blood Lotus Jade] from a foreign domain by chance, and over the past few hundred years, he had continued to refine it by using the first drop of blood essence from women with great physical attributes. This small piece of [Demon Blood Lotus Jade] had already absorbed the hatred and vengefulness of tens of thousands of weak women, so the evil blood qi it contained was extremely full of yin energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a resounding crash that echoed like thunder from the Ninth Heaven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rich and dazzling divine fist radiance collided forcefully against the evil yin blood light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The resulting blast could be felt throughout the universe and even the mountains and rocks several hundred meters away were sent flying like tattered cloth or fluttering willows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dazzling glow of the divine radiance carried with it an authoritative power that seemed to be from the gods, as though the heavens had joined forces with the earth to produce heavenly thunder and ground fires. When it collided against the [Demon Blood Lotus Jade], it only paused for the smallest beat, then that blood-colored lotus shattered into pieces, as if it was made of clay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blood-colored shards hung motionless in midair like ice crystals, as though they were held in place by some mysterious force. Then, it turned into a bloody mist that was tens of thousands of meters tall before it disappeared into nothingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The divine radiance fist force charged on powerfully, without losing any momentum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mouthfuls of blood spurted out from the mouth of the master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect after his life weapon was destroyed, as though he had been struck by thunder. He did not have the time to do anything, nor did he have the chance to flee from the hurtling fist force before half his body was smashed to pieces. He looked like a character from a drawing who had half his body erased—it was a strange sight to behold. He was sent flying from the fist force with blood drenching his entire body, as though he had been hauled up from a bloody river, and he could not stop trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, the master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect was extremely frightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He finally understood that the punches from this mysterious person were not something that he could handle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To make matters worse, that fourth ray of divine radiance fist force continued to charge onward powerfully. It hurtled several thousand meters across the sky and moved as fast as lightning to sweep toward the disciples of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect who were behind their master. It shredded the final black mist skull defensive formation to pieces. Those hundreds of Heaven Desire Demon Sect disciples did not even have the chance to flee before they were torn apart by the radiance like vanishing shadows. These disciples became green smoke, which dissipated in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The appearance of this mysterious stranger had caused the tide to turn completely in the Hundred Spirits Sect's favor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several dozen elders and experts from Heaven Desire Demon Sect who had been fortunate enough to survive the attack were all critically injured, while the remaining thousands of disciples were so frightened that they had lost all their will to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a matter of four punches, the Heaven Desire Demon Sect was completely defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a disastrous defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect gathered his blood qi once again and barely managed to reconstruct the missing half of his body. He was completely dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never expected such a formidable person to exist in this world. He felt the grim reaper drawing closer and a chill shot up from his spine all the way up to the heavens. He was completely frightened out of his wits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">God!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was like a War God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The power he wielded was far too terrifying. This was not something those from the mortal realm could handle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When did the Hundred Spirits Sect come to know such a terrifying character?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he had known that the Hundred Spirits Sect had such a powerful ally, he would have never led his sect to attack the Hundred Spirits Sect. Not only that, but he would have made sure that the Heaven Desire Demon Sect stayed far away from the Greater One Sect and went into hiding. Making an enemy out of this terrifying person would be equivalent to handing an invitation to the grim reaper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw that the remaining disciples were scared out of their wits and the master himself had also lost all confidence in battling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Retreat… let's go!" he yelped in fright like a homeless dog, then turned into a ray of lightning and tried to flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Go? Since you are already here, you might as well leave your lives behind."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That authoritative voice rang out from the Void once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The figure, who was a flickering stream of light, transformed into a bolt of blinding silver lightning with a thunderous force. It moved later than him but arrived faster, taking only a span of one breath to catch up to the fleeing master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a flash of silver light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A ray of sword light appeared from that figure's hand, with which he held down the head of the master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect. As he turned his hand over, sword light flashed as he gently sliced down in one strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Killing intent exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood light burst forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect was immediately beheaded and his head was in the hands of that mysterious person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite the fact that he had thousands of divine artifacts, heaven-defying demonic skills, countless life-saving methods, and had the ability to transform into thousands of clones, the moment that palm held him down, the master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect became like a chick that was held by its neck. He did not have any room to struggle before the sword light came flashing. It did not just slice off his head, but also his spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His physical and spiritual forms were both destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood arrows gushed like fountains from the headless body that then plummeted down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The master of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect was dead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the ground—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Tieyi, Hu Bugui, and those from the Hundred Spirits Sect were utterly shocked and astonished and they all froze as though they had been fossilized. No one could utter a single word as they stared up in the Void with a mixture of fear, respect, and disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the remaining disciples of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect saw what had happened, some of them were so frightened that they immediately fainted, plummeting to the ground, while the elders and experts were all scared out of their wits. They crawled and rolled in midair, even drawing on their life forces to flee as fast as they could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That fiendgod-like figure in the Void raised the head of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect's master up high and did not pursue those people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His gaze swept past them like divine swords and he did not seem to have any interest in chasing after those defeated troops. He did not chase after these fleeing disciples, nor did he make any move to attack. Instead, he grabbed the white creature on his shoulder and flung it in the direction of the fleeing disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'll leave the rest to you," the figure said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After it was thrown out, this round white creature panicked and struggled in midair. Then, it suddenly transformed into a blinding white light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, no one could see what exactly had been flung out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could it be a magical item?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Woof! Woof! Woof!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A series of clear but silly barks suddenly could be heard from this tragic battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The barking sounds first sounded annoyed but soon turned into joyous barks. At the tail end of these silly barks that echoed all around, they could vaguely sense a powerful force that could pierce the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next instant, this white light, which was like an electric divine snake, flickered quickly as it rapidly expanded in midair to form a gigantic white beast that was thousands of meters tall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This gigantic beast towered like the ancient divine mountains and its fangs were like giant axes and steel sabers. Its eyes glittered like bright suns and its four limbs were like heavenly pillars. It was covered in white fur that fluttered in the wind, each strand extremely clean, giving off rays of purple lightning. It looked extremely mysterious and even exuded an ancient and powerful cruel qi from within its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since when did such a gigantic mythical creature exist in the Clear River Domain?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone within the defensive formation was both shocked and confused. At that moment, no one could tell what kind of mythical creature it was but they did not dare to rashly leave their final layer of protection and so continued to observe the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, that gigantic creature did not seem to take any interest in them. It opened its mouth to swallow the remaining bits of the Heaven Desire Demon Sect master's body. Then, it looked around and happily chased after the fleeing troops from the Heaven Desire Demon Sect. In spite of its gigantic size—or to be exact, it was rather plump and chubby and even moved awkwardly and slowly in the Void—it managed to cover a distance of a few thousand meters with each step it took. It turned out to be surprisingly agile and moved like a divine leopard hunting its prey and was so powerful that the heavens shook. It even seemed to activate the power of laws and caused countless heavenly bursts of thunder to roll across the sky, the earth to tremble, and the mountains to quake.&nbsp;</span></p>
