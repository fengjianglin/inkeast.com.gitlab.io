 <p>Ye Qingyu felt extremely repressed.</p>
 <p>Three days and three nights had already passed. He used all the methods in his disposal, but he was still not able to walk out from amongst the [Light Palace]. But thankfully, he could see the little white rabbit hopping down from the floating stone steps. It did not seem to be restricted by that invisible energy, and the Little Silver dragon was also successfully able to depart from the [Light Palace]...</p>
 <p>It was only that he himself had no way of leaving.</p>
 <p>That mysterious invisible energy seemed as if it had something intentionally against him.</p>
 <p>In these three days, Ye Qingyu attempted to allow people from below to come up.</p>
 <p>The results were somewhat unexpected ---</p>
 <p>The consciousness of the Spirit monkey statue did not seem to reject anyone anymore. Not only was it Liu Jingyan and the other great envoys, even the little soldiers under the command of the large fatty were also about to successfully and easily ascend the stone steps to the base of the stone palace. But they could only reach to here. If they wanted to head further in, then that mysterious and invisble energy would prevent their footsteps from going any further.</p>
 <p>In other words, the current situation was that Ye Qingyu could not get out, but others could also not enter.</p>
 <p>Only the little silver dragon and the little white rabbit could enter and depart as they pleased.</p>
 <p>After telling Liu Jingyan and the others to temporarily depart from the fourth area, Ye Qingyu lay on the jade bed. He was both repressed, and did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
 <p>"Their mother, if this continues on, I'll go crazy."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could not help but shout.</p>
 <p>If he continued to be trapped here, many of Ye Qingyu's plans would fall through as a result of this.</p>
 <p>Could it be that he would be trapped hre for the rest of his life?</p>
 <p>At this time, a voice sounded without any signs or warning---</p>
 <p>"If you go out, you will die for sure."</p>
 <p>This voice sounded out from the west side of the jade bed. The sensation it gave Ye Qingyu was that someone was quietly whispering something from beneath the bed.</p>
 <p>With a bang, Ye Qingyu jumped up from the bed.</p>
 <p>"Who is it? Come out!"</p>
 <p>He focused his whole attention to below the stone bed.</p>
 <p>But if he carefully inspected, beneath the stone bed was completely empty. There was not anything at all.</p>
 <p>"Little fellow, your guts are so small, you seem to not handle a fright well," the voice sounded out again from another angle, it's tone somewhat strange. It was not human, but the words it spoke with was the most normal official language of Snow Empire, extremely pure. There was a hint of teasingness within his tone.</p>
 <p>But this time, the direction the voice came from was above his head.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not attempt to search for the voice.</p>
 <p>But he could already tell that the voice that constantly changed it's position did not want to expose it's location so there was no use in searching for it.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Ye Qingyu could tell that the voice had appeared once before.</p>
 <p>The "what the fuck" that had been said when the little silver dragon swallowed the silver snake was namely spoken by this voice.</p>
 <p>This represented that he had hiddenly observed everything that had happened within the [Light Palace]. What was even a greater possiblity was that everything that had happeneed within the [Light Palace] was under his control.</p>
 <p>Thinking of the words this voice spoke previously, Ye Qingyu stabilized himself and attempted to converse wthi him, "Elder, where are you? Why is it that after I depart, I will die? Please clear things up for me."</p>
 <p>"You successfully entered the [Light Palace] and caused the Divine Sword of Light to appear once again. You have already broken the great taboo of several major factions of Snow Empire. You have become the thorn in their eyes. right now the people that want to kill you can line up in a queue from Youyan Pass to the capital. If you leave the [Light Palace], in but a few moments time, you will turn ito a corpse,” the voice said.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was taken aback, "This... how could this be?"</p>
 <p>"Because they are all afraid of you. They are afraid that you will once again bring blood and death to Heaven Wasteland Domain. They are afraid of being enwrapped into this..." The voice laughed, then said somewhat teasingly, "Those previous Lords were not able to ascend the stone steps. They were not able to enter into the divine palace, so they are still alive. You, you are different. You are able to do what the founding Lord of the Light Palace was able to do, so there is no one who can bear to have you alive."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu seemed to understand, "But... even I don't understand why I was able to enter the divine palace. Why was it that after I sat on the jade chair, such strange things would occur?"</p>
 <p>"Hehehehe..." The voice sounded out once agin in a proud tone. "Why would such things ocur? Ahaha, of course it's because I made it happen."</p>
 <p>"Elder you... are the Spirit monkey?" Ye Qingyu was speechless, suddenly realizing something. No wonder the tone of the opposing party was not right. He suddenly grasped that within the voice, those strange noises contained within the voice were sounds that did not belong to humans.</p>
 <p>"Ai, you are quite the clever little kid. Of course it's me, otherwise why would it be that others aren't able to ascend the stone steps but you are able to?" The voice was still proud. "Do you think the formation can distinguish between people?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was speechless.</p>
 <p>"Then why did you fool me into entering?"</p>
 <p>"You will know of the reasons within this later..." the voice of the Spirit monkey sounded out. "First don't ask so many questions, just stay here and honestly cultivate. The reason I don't allow you to leave is naturally to protect you.When you have enough strength to face the oncoming stormy onslaught from the outside, then at that time, I will naturally release you."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu believed in the words of the battle companion, the Spirit monkey.</p>
 <p>But he was still somewhat unwilling, "In truth, I have some good friends as well as some cards up my sleeve, I..."</p>
 <p>"I know nearly all of the cards up your sleeve. Young man, don't be stubborn. I have met many young heroic people like you, with peerless fortune, but in the end they were too stubborn. Right now, the grass on their graves must have withered ten times over...." The Spirit monkey used a pressuring tone..</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu: "...”</p>
 <p>"But my friends are on the outside..." Ye Qingyu attempted to persuade the opposing party.</p>
 <p>The Spirit monkey interrupted his sentence. "Don't worry, there will naturally be people sent to protect them... for those little fellows at the Medicine Hut, you can place them into the City of Light. As long as they do not leave this fire tree forest, they will not encounter any danger.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu heard it's words and felt that this monkey seemed to know everything, as if he had planned this for a long time.</p>
 <p>"If I train and cultivate here, when will I be able to depart?" Ye Qingyu asked again.</p>
 <p>"The pinnacle of the Bitter Sea stage? Or perhaps the Heaven Ascension stage?" The Spirit monkey laughed hiddenly. "I also can't say, it depends on the situation. Hehe, first cultivate, it depends on my decision at that time."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu suddenly felt that the heavens itself had gone dark.</p>
 <p>Are you joking?</p>
 <p>Not to mention the Heaven Ascension stage, even the pinnacle of the Bitter Sea stage was a distant target. Right now he was only at the Creek level of the Bitter Sea stage. If he wanted to reach the pinnacle, tens of years was at least needed .The progress of the martial path became more difficult the further one travelled. Not only did one have to devoutly cultivate, one also had to depend on fortune and cultivation technique. There were many top level experts at the Bitter Sea stage who could not guarantee that they could definitely train until they reached the pinnacle of the Bitter Sea stage.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's strength progressed quickly, but his foundations were still shallow. He had only cultivated for less than two years of time, to reach to the Creek level of the Bitter Sea stage was due to numerous fortuitous encounters as well as the aid of the ancient bronze book. But every step of cultivation afterwards was going against heavens. As to when he would reach the pinnacle of the Bitter Sea stage, this was something he had no confidence in uttering.</p>
 <p>"Within the [Light Palace], there is the [Great Light Cycle] formation. It can attract energy to refine your body, it can also increase yuan qi. The stone bed, stone chair, and stone table at the center zre all sculpted from cold jade at the very northern peak. Earth fire and cold jade, yin and yang, cold and hot. they oppose and support each other, the power it emits is compatible with the heavenly way. As the saying goes, the solo yang does not grow, the lonely yin does not flourish. Only by combining both can miracles happen. Within the entire capital, there is not another place more suitable for cultvating than this. Even the Snow Emperor at that time wanted to come here and train, you little brat, don't complain after receiving such a great fotune.”</p>
 <p>The Spirit monkey's voice sounded out again from another angle.</p>
 <p>What else could Ye Qingyu say?</p>
 <p>If the battle companion spirit monkey firmed it's resolve into not letting him leave, then no matter what he said, it would have no effects.</p>
 <p>There were still many questions in Ye Qingyu's heart, so he decided to just still his heart, and began enquiring about many of the matters regarding that War God. When such a topic was brought up, the voice of that Spirit monkey suddenly disappeared. No matter how Ye Qingyu asked, the opposing party would not respond.</p>
 <p>Therefore Ye Qingyu could only give up.</p>
 <p>Since he could not depart, Ye Qingyu ordered Liu Jingyan and the others over. After making arrangements, he ordered people to go to the Medicine Hut and bring Jin Ling'er, Mother Wu, and the others into the City of Light. They were to create a temporary tent for them to live amidst the fire tree forest...</p>
 <p>Dugu Quan and Ouyang Buping had also came personally to the [Light Palace]. They came to the last step of the floating stone steps, and was blocked by that invisible barrier. They discussed somethigns secretly with Ye Qingyu...</p>
 <p>In the following days, Ye Qingyu could have been said to reside permanently within the [Light Palace]. He began to cultivate, without knowing just when it would end.</p>
 <p>Everything seemed calmed and peaceful.</p>
 <p>It was only that because of Ye Qingyu's appearance within the City of Light, there was something different. The big fatty military officer prodded the soldiers in his camp to shout their military names to the heavens, and began drilling them on the martial practice grounds. He had also pantingly participated within, and the Envoys of Light would also come regularly every day each evening to the fourth area of the Light to report...</p>
 <p>The fourth day.</p>
 <p>Wen Wan and Ximen Yeshui, as the confidants of Ye Qingyu, also successfully entered into the Light. They became temporary Envoys of Light, only when they had truly achieved something and passed some tests of the [Light Palace] could they truly be appointed to the permanent position of the Envoy of Light.</p>
 <p>The tenth day.</p>
 <p>Gao Han, The fisherman of Han River, under the direction of Lin Baiyi, came to the City of Light and stayed within it. The first day he came here, he discussed things for a while with Ye Qingyu on the stone steps. Two days layer, the news that Gao Han had become the seventh Envoy of Light was also announced to the outside world...</p>
 <p>As such, the seven Envoys of Light that had always been incomplete had finally been filled.</p>
 <p>This could be counted as the first important matter Ye Qingyu did after becoing Lord of the Light Palace.</p>
 <p>The position of the Lord of the Light Palace was special and held special powers along with it. Such appointments did not need the permission of the Imperial family or the military department. They only had to report it...</p>
 <p>At night during the fifteenth day, something unexpected occurred.</p>
 <p>A massive black demonic palm appeared high above the City of Light. Under the cover of pitch black night, it headed soundlessly without any signs towards the [Light Palace]. This apocolyptic demonic palm was unmatched, even the layers after layers of protective formations above the capital could not block it. It struck downwards instantly, and was at least several thousand meters long. There was a black demonic flame burning between the fingers of the massive palm heading for the [Light Palace]...</p>
 <p>At that instant, Ye Qingyu could sense an aura like death approaching----</p>
