<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color: black">Chapter 621, Someone above</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">The round-faced Prince yawned and stretched lazily, looking at Ye Qingyu who just slowly stepped out the door. Leaning against a tree, his expression was as if he had finally found an old friend. Faintly smiling he exclaimed, “Hey, you’re finally out.”</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Ye Qingyu’s eyes flashed a hint of surprise, “You were waiting for me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">“Yes, while you’ve been training in seclusion, spectacles were frequently appearing across the heaven and earth. There was a tremendous movement outside of Flowing Light City that could be seen from hundreds of miles away, and it stirred up a commotion... Haha, I have a curious mind, so I of course had to come see,” with a light smile on his face, the round-faced Prince said firmly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">“Just to come and see?” Ye Qingyu’s expression was calm despite being unable to understand what the other party’s intention was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">His divine sense diffused out. It was only when he found out that Flowing Light City was in a peaceful condition, the Demon Spider army had not counterattacked, and it appeared that only Mojin came to the stone tower alone, did he feel more relaxed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Given the round-faced Prince’s strength, in Flowing Light City, except Hu Bugui, there indeed was no one that can stop him. Moreover, if attempted to sneak in quietly, Hu Bugui most likely would not notice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">The round-faced Prince Mojin evidently felt Ye Qingyu’s divine sense extending. He smiled, saying, “Rest assured, this city, I won't touch it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Although they were enemies, but Ye Qingyu began to understand this round-faced demon prince. From his manner, he knew that he really had no intention of attacking Flowing Light City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">“Then why did you come to find me?” Ye Qingyu looked him in the eye, asking with bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">The round-faced Prince smiled. Rubbing his nose, the gold embroidered pattern on his red-black robe faintly radiating brilliance as he strode forward, he stopping ten steps before Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">He lowered his voice to a very mysterious proud tone. “I told you. To see you, haha, Deer City, White Deer Academy, Youyan Pass, Snow capital... [War God] Ye Qingyu, Haha, what a resounding name. From the commotion you caused these days, no wonder that you are called the genius of Heaven Wasteland Domain. Your pace of cultivation is astonishing and despite being from a small domain. Compared to those so-called geniuses of Clear River Domain, you are much superior.”</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Ye Qingyu’s pupil shrank when he heard these words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">The aura around his body sharply rose.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">“You know?” Ye Qingyu firmly stared at Mojin. “You... how do you know so much? You've been to Heaven Wasteland Domain?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">He was certain that Mojin was not trying to test him.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Because if he did not know about Heaven Wasteland Domain, there was absolutely no way he would mention Deer City, White Deer Academy, and Youyan Pass. He even more would not know that Ye Qingyu obtained the title of [War God] during the military training in Snow capital.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">This guy, how come he had so much information?</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Had the Demon Spider Race already invaded Heaven Wasteland Domain?</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Or could it be...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Ye Qingyu’s mind was a bit chaotic at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">A fierce aura diffused out from his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">The round-faced Prince Mojin smiled and motioned with his hands, “Calm down, calm down, I did not come to fight.”</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">As he was speaking, he took a few steps back and spread open his hands, indicating his non-malicious intent. Then a mysterious smile spread across his face as he propped up his chin with one hand and grinned, “I have not been to Heaven Wasteland Domain, the Demon Spider Race also has not found the coordinates of Heaven Wasteland Domain. Don't worry, the small domain is still good for now... Haha, but, it is no exaggeration to say that I understand you more than you think I do. And most likely that your loyal friends in Clear River Domain, Hu Bugui, Liu Shaji and others do not know you as well as I do.”</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Ye Qingyu was taken aback.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">At this moment, there was no need for the round-faced Prince Mojin to deceive him, and since he had said with such certainty, it was clear that Heaven Wasteland Domain was safe for now.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Slowly exhaling, Ye Qingyu quickly calmed down, eyeing the other party with a piercing stare, as though attempting to see through the Demon Spider Prince, “Speak, what did you come here for?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">The round-faced Prince shrugged, grinning, “I told you already, you had caused such big commotions, I just came to see you. Haha, I have a really strong sense of curiosity. In fact, when you came to Clear River Domain. I should have recognized you.”</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">“Recognize me?” Ye Qingyu captured some information from these words, “So in other words, before I came to Clear River Domain, you’ve already heard about me?”</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">The round-faced Prince nodded firmly. “Perhaps you do not know, but you’re quite famous. At least, even if I know that you’re the evil member of Heaven Wasteland Domain that the Greater One Sect mentions, the important figure that my Demon Spider Race and many major forces of Clear River Domain want to capture, but... even so, I do not dare touch you.”</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Looking at the mysterious look on his face, Ye Qingyu was more confused than before.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Now that Ye Qingyu’s strength had dramatically risen, stepped into the Immortal Step boundary, and his consciousness power had long reached the peak of the Immortal Step boundary, not only did he gain a new understanding of this world, his sixth sense and intuition also climbed to an incomparably sharp degree as a result. No matter whether it was with people or matters, he had an inexorable sharp judgement.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">And now, this intuition told Ye Qingyu that the ordinary-looking round-faced man before him was not talking nonsense.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Since it was not nonsense, then the information he revealed was worth pondering.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">“Why?” Ye Qingyu looked at him, without hiding his surprise in the slightest. He calmed down, decreasing his watchfulness and stepped forward, saying with a smile, “Why do you not dare to touch me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">The round-faced Prince’s expression suddenly became a bit strange, bowing his head he sighed, “Mistake, it is a mistake. I just came to see your condition and then leave, but in the end I could not help but to say a few words...” Here, he stretched out his index finger with a look of distress and pointed up. “I can only tell you that someone above does not allow me to touch you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">There's someone up there?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Ye Qingyu was taken aback. “You mean, in the Demon Spider Race, someone is protecting me?”</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">The round-face Prince shook his head and said in a disdainful tone, “Those stubborn, old ones in the clan are all short-sighted, what do they know...” the high and mighty Prince cursed. Evidently he had no favourable opinions of the elders in the Demon Spider Race. “I will not care about what some old guys think, but you’re right. There is someone above who wants to protect you, and this person’s status is a bit scary.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Ye Qingyu's puzzlement deepened, “Just who is this person?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">The round-faced Prince shook his head as he moved back several steps, before he said, “I cannot say, don't ask.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Cannot say?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Ye Qingyu was even more shocked</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">The round-faced Demon Spider Race Prince was not an easy person to deal with. He even looked down on the elders of the Demon Spider Race and openly called them old guys. He was evidently a fearless demon, but he personally admitted that he does not dare to say? Who was he afraid of? What kind of person could make this little demon this scared? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">“Don't guess, you'll never guess.” The round-faced Prince knew what Ye Qingyu was thinking from his expression. “I will not give you any hint, the information that I know about you was from there. Don’t worry I will not do any adverse things to you, and also will not attack Flowing Light City. If I really wanted to kill you, I could have joined hands with Mofeng to kill you... You should be able to feel my sincerity through this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">“Sincerity?” Ye Qingyu suddenly smiled. “Although you did not reveal too much information, but I think this person you mentioned must know me very, very well, right? Otherwise you wouldn’t have gotten so much information of me, and this person that knows and understands me so well, at least, has lived with me, or has paid special attention to me. There are only a few of such people, if I analyse carefully...”</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">“Shut up.” The round-faced Prince, like a rabbit whose tail was being stepped on, suddenly jumped up. “Don't say it. Anyway I wasn’t the person who told you such information. Do not drag me down, even if you guessed who it is, do not say it out loud. I don’t know anything.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Ye Qingyu stared at him blankly.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">He did not expect the round-faced chubby guy to react so strongly from a few words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">All of a sudden, Ye Qingyu felt that the chubby guy was somewhat a little cute, and completely different to the berserk and fierce demon look that many people imagine the Demon Race to be.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">“Well, since you don’t want to kill me, and do not want to attack Flowing Light City, then why is the army still outside the city and had not retreated?” Ye Qingyu smiled and looked at him. “You are a demon prince, but you can't command a Demon Spider army?”</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">The round-face Prince smiled. “That is not it, I was just a little curious about you. I wanted to find a chance to see what kind of person you are, so I did not leave, and ordered the people of the Devouring Heaven camp to accompany me to stay for a few more days. But today, I have told Tong Wen to retreat.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Ye Qingyu’s brow furrowed in disbelief. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Just because of his curiosity, the army had stationed here for so many days. How much rations and fodder and military supplies had been wasted? Because the Devouring Heaven camp had not retreated, the people in Flowing Light City had not been able to relax and thought the Demon Spider Race was planning a counterattack. Who would have imagined that...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Those with power are willful.</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Too willful. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">After a pause, Ye Qingyu thought of something else. “The retreat of the Devouring Heaven camp means the Demon Spider Race has given up on Flowing Light City, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span style="color: black">Upon hearing this remark, the round-faced Prince abruptly laughed-----</span></p>
