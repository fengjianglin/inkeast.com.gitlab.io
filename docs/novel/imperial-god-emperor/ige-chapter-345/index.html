 <p>Chapter 345, Affairs in Weicheng City are Settled</p>
 <p>When the carriage arrived at Spring Street, the number of people behind them had reached the thousands.</p>
 <p>Wu Xi and a group of rich young masters that have been acting like tyrants doing whatever they wish in Weicheng City, had already diminished their popularity, and at this moment, many people wanted to personally see their wretched state. Looking at his miserable face driving the carriage, many people felt incomparably good.</p>
 <p>Of course, many people guessed at just what sort of steel plate that the [Number One Young Master of Weicheng City] had kicked. To think he would be in such a pickle.</p>
 <p>Wu Xi, who had been surrounded by onlookers all this time, had finally reached his tolerance limit.</p>
 <p>“Who’s fucking following me, I’m going to kill them later.”</p>
 <p>Wu Xi, like a raging wild dog, roared and lashed the whip in his hand.</p>
 <p>The people around the carriage were immediately frightened by him.</p>
 <p>The crowd that was following him was finally a little smaller than before.</p>
 <p>Around the corner of Spring Street, dozens of guards clad in purple were blocking the street.</p>
 <p>The three Youyan soldiers escorted the carriage onto the street.</p>
 <p>There was not many people on the street, and most of the shops on either side were closed.</p>
 <p>This time of the day was the time with the most pedestrians, and the best business time for the shops. The appearance of this scene was obviously not normal.</p>
 <p>Seeing tens of purple-clad guards, Wu Xi was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief and began to get excited.</p>
 <p>They were the people of his Wu household.</p>
 <p>His father must have sent them.</p>
 <p>To have the power to seal the entire Spring Street and to impose such security measures, only his uncle the City Lord was able to, which means that his uncle had also arrived. At this moment Wu Xi was no longer afraid, his heart became alive again.</p>
 <p>After an instant.</p>
 <p>The carriage came to a stop right at the door of a shop in the middle of Spring Street.</p>
 <p>It was a three-storey shop, the size was not small or big, and hanging at the door should have been the sign ‘The Four Seas Store’, but it had been changed to ‘Forever Prosperity Hall’. It was the property of the Wu household.</p>
 <p>At the doorway of the shop stood dozens of heavily armoured guards with blades strapped at their waist.</p>
 <p>Two forty- or fifty-year-old burly and serious-looking middle-aged men were also standing there quietly.</p>
 <p>“Father, Uncle!”</p>
 <p>Wu Xi excitedly shouted.</p>
 <p>As expected, both his dad and uncle have taken action.</p>
 <p>He was just about to toss away the long whip in his hand and jump down from the carriage, when suddenly an icy chill enveloped him, The sword-like glare from the three Youyan soldiers next to him made Wu Xi immediately shrink back in fear and dared not move the slightest.</p>
 <p>The carriage stopped.</p>
 <p>But no one got off.</p>
 <p>The three Youyan soldiers’ face was void of expression, standing quietly and waiting.</p>
 <p>On the platform steps.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man on the right in a purple qipao gown stepped forward, slightly cupped his hands and said, “I heard that Marquis Ye has come to our Weicheng City, please forgive us for giving you such a poor reception, Marquis Ye please grace us with your presence.”</p>
 <p>This man was Wu Xi’s father Wu Boxiong, the official registrar of Weicheng City.</p>
 <p>There was no response from the carriage.</p>
 <p>But Gao Qui gave a clenched-fist salute, responding, “Marquis has another important matter to attend to, maybe later.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had not followed.</p>
 <p>Once they got out of Donkey Tail alley, and seeing that Gao Shou had not returned from the Weicheng City prison, Ye Qingyu guessed that he might have ran into an accident, so he personally went over to see what exactly happened.</p>
 <p>“So Marquis has not yet arrived. Little brother, can you let my child off first?” Wu Boxiong had a smile on his face and spoke politely, with no signs of resentment or irritation.</p>
 <p>Gao Qui shook his head, “Marquis had given the order that your young master can only leave when he arrives. We cannot comply with your request.”</p>
 <p>Wu Boxiong seemed stumped for words, then turned his head to look at the middle-aged man with a long black beard and a bronze-like complexion, the City Lord of Weicheng City, Wu Guanxiong, who slightly shook his head, motioning for him not to act rashly. Wu Boxiong held back his anger, nodding, “I see, then we will wait for Marquis Ye to come.”</p>
 <p>The look on Wu Xi’s face took a twisted and bitter expression.</p>
 <p>He did not think that his dad and uncle could not solve this matter.</p>
 <p>And it seems that his father and uncle were very afraid of that Marquis Ye.</p>
 <p>It was only then that Wu Xi was vaguely aware of the seriousness of the matter.</p>
 <p>And at this moment, the Liao family on the carriage, through the gap, was able to see what kind of people were outside. Since the matter had come to this stage, they could only quietly wait on the carriage.</p>
 <p>The crowd waited for another 10 minutes.</p>
 <p>A sudden brilliance flashed before the carriage.</p>
 <p>Wu Boxiong and his brother were blurred for a moment, when a white jade figure emerged at the side of the carriage.</p>
 <p>It was Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Besides Ye Qingyu, Gao Shou had also returned, supporting a middle-aged man that was breathing weakly and covered with bloodstains all over his body.</p>
 <p>“Second elder brother!”</p>
 <p>There was an exclamation of joy and excitement coming from the carriage. Liao Cui could wait no longer, jumped down, hugged the middle-aged man and burst into tears.</p>
 <p>“Little Sister?” The middle-aged man opened his eyes with difficulty. He was the Liao Ri who was taken to prison and tortured for dozens of days. Fortunately, Wu Xi wanted to use Liao Ri’s life to threaten Liao Cui, so he had not killed him yet. Liao Ri was barely alive and riddled with scars.</p>
 <p>“Son.”</p>
 <p>Liao Xiongyi and his wife also jumped off the carriage, and the family of four buried their heads into each others shoulders, sobbing bitterly yet joyfully.</p>
 <p>On the other side.</p>
 <p>Wu Boxiong and Wu Guanxiong were standing in awe of Ye Qingyu’s sudden appearance and the incredible strength that he showed. They had heard the rumours about Ye Qingyu countless times before, and were fearful of him. As skilled martial masters, with one glance of Ye Qingyu’s appearance, they knew that this person’s real strength was far above what the rumours had suggested.</p>
 <p>“Marquis Ye, I have heard all about you.”</p>
 <p>The City Lord of Weicheng City, Wu Guanxiong, walked down the steps, with a polite smile on his face and a cupped fist salute.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded his head.</p>
 <p>Spring Street had been blocked and the two powerful figures appeared here. The Commander of the City Patrol Guan Shandu must have notified these two people.</p>
 <p>“This child is ignorant and offended Marquis Ye, I ask for the Marquis’ forgiveness, since it’s his first offense please forgive him?” Wu Boxiong also came forward and pleaded, his attitude incredibly polite.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu gave a wave of his hand.</p>
 <p>Gao Qui let Wu Xi down and pushed him over to them.</p>
 <p>Wu Xi took a deep gasp, like he had escape from the hands of the god of death, scurried behind his father and covered his stomach with his hands, finally feeling a slight sense of security. He dared not have any thoughts of resentment and retaliation, keeping his head low and avoiding breathing too loudly.</p>
 <p>By this time, he had finally understood who the young man called Marquis Ye was.</p>
 <p>[The Leaf of Youyan], Ye Qingyu. The legendary maniac killer, a martial master that does whatever he likes, had his own way, and was said to have entered the ranks of the top level experts. Such an existence was definitely not someone a little aristocratic young master like him could offend.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Marquis Ye.” Wu Guanxiong also heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>He was afraid that Ye Qingyu would refuse to forgive him on this matter.</p>
 <p>“Don’t thank me,” Ye Qingyu said bluntly. “I spared his life not because I have a soft heart, nor am I afraid of your Wu family’s power, nor because you have what Right Minister behind your back, but for Uncle Liao and his family, so that they can peacefully and safely live in Weicheng City. My meaning, you understand right?”</p>
 <p>Weicheng City’s two powerful leaders looked somewhat distressed.</p>
 <p>This Ye Qingyu was really the same as they say. He did not give face to anyone.</p>
 <p>Wu Boxiong forced a smile. “Marquis Ye’s meaning, we understand. Rest assured that the Liao family will be absolutely safe in Weicheng City, there will be no one that dares to harass them or bully them.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu face was slightly brighter than before. “Uncle Liao’s second son Liao Tian died to save me. I owe the Liao family and the Four Seas Merchant Company a lot. I will not sit and do nothing. In the future, no matter who, if any one of the Liao family encounters an accident, regardless of the reason, no matter what happened, I will personally come back and behead Wu Xi. You understand what I mean?”</p>
 <p>What?</p>
 <p>The complexion of Wu Boxiong and his brother suddenly changed.</p>
 <p>“This... if it’s an accident, a member of the Liao family dies, this...” Wu Boxiong showed signs of reluctance, trying to explain something.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu coldly interrupted, “Then you better pray that this kind of accident does not happen, I will not investigate so many things, as long as the Liao family runs into an accident, then Wu Xi must die.”</p>
 <p>His words were unhesitating and his tone did not allow any negotiation.</p>
 <p>On Wu Boxiong’s face, a displeased expression emerged.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu then said, “What? Feel unfair?”</p>
 <p>Wu Boxiong had a cold face, not uttering a word.</p>
 <p>In Weicheng City, he was considered an influential and powerful person, under one person and above millions. With the stamp of his foot the whole Weicheng City would shake three times, when had he ever been threatened?</p>
 <p>“Your son has committed all kinds of crimes and acts like a tyrant in Weicheng City. A simple investigation of his crimes and he should be beheaded 10 times. Even if you are the official registrar, you also cannot get out of it. You want to discuss with me what is fair? A thing that is lower than a dog or a pig, killing him would dirty my hands. To tell you the truth, I am not discussing with you now, but I am telling you plainly that if you feel that you can protect him, then let him continue to do evil and see how the Heavens will punish your Wu family.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu said each word loud and clear.</p>
 <p>The imposing manner of a top level expert filled the air.</p>
 <p>The Wu brothers, Wu Xi and the other people felt parched and a short of breath, as though they were underneath an invisible ageless mountain and could be crushed at any time.</p>
 <p>“Marq... Marquis Ye mercy, I... I understand,” Wu Boshong cried.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu loosened his pressuring aura. The surrounding people instantly felt they could breathe again.</p>
 <p>“Give the Liao family back their business, pay three times the compensation, then I can leave this matter be for the time being,” Ye Qingyu said impatiently. “Liao family’s second son Liao Tian is a hero of Youyan Pass, he has the special care of the Empire, his family are also put under protection. I have asked Uncle Liao, the Liao family has not received the empire’s death benefit, this must be something you did too? They were persecuted by you to this degree, if the Youyan Pass finds out about this matter, your Wu family can wait to be buried.”</p>
 <p>With these words, the Wu brothers’ foreheads were immediately dripping with cold sweats.</p>
 <p>At this time, would they still dare argue with him about other things.</p>
 <p>The things that they have done, if no one checks, then it is trivial, but if the people of the Empire really investigated, it is a big hole, especially if it involves the military .Even a hereditary noble could not protect them.</p>
 <p>Seeing that these two people were scared stiff, Ye Qingyu no longer said anything else.</p>
 <p>He turned around, said a few words to the Liao family, and watched the sign of ‘Forever Prosperity Hall’ being changed and the ‘Four Seas’ merchant sign being hung up. All things have now been settled and the corpse of the second sentinel has been delivered to the Liao family; his trip to Weicheng City had come to an end.</p>
 <p>After one hour.</p>
 <p>[Bright Sword Ship] rose into the sky, sinking into the clouds and leaving Weicheng City, heading in the direction of Snow Capital at lightning speed.</p>
