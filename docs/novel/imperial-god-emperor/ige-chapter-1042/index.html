 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I...” Lu Wei mumbled with a complicated expression. “Thank you, I owe you a life.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled, “I still owe your grandfather a life.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Wei didn't say anything more. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was also part of the Human Race, had a deep family heritage, and ever since coming to the world had been arrogant and saw nothing worthwhile around him. He thought he was the strongest human of his generation, and as a result challenged Ye Qingyu. Lu Wei could not accept Ye Qingyu's huge fame, and was discontent ever since that day Ye Qingyu destroyed his sword; however, this arrogant youngster was beginning to admire him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not just Lu Wei who was shocked. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were also other experts. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, all of the experts present felt that Ye Qingyu would surely die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the experts who had goodwill and affection for Ye Qingyu had no time to make any reaction or help.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who would have thought that Ye Qingyu had such a means of saving himself, which was able to even avoid the attack that a Quasi-emperor had risked his life to launch out. It was too in defiance of the natural order that many people wanted to curse out loud. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After, the old man Quasi-emperor was taken aback for a moment, nodded with a thoughtful expression on his face and a hint of relief flashed across.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was even more relieved that Lu Wei was under Ye Qingyu's protection. Apart from the Quasi-emperors, the other people would not be able to harm his only grandson thus he could entirely focus on the battle. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man turned around, stepping into the great battle with the other three Quasi-emperors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The situation was overturned right away. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously it was only [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] struggling to withstand against three people, even though his bravery was unmatched he still found it difficult to turn around the situation. But now Quasi-emperor Mushan had fallen and the old man Quasi-emperor had joined the battle, turning the situation into two against two. The number was completely balanced, but the scene was completely one-sided based on combat force. Whether it was [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] or the old man Quasi-emperor, both were much stronger than the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor and the ancient macaque-resembling, lightning wielding Quasi-emperor. Previously [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was able to suppress two Quasi-emperors, not to mention now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aaahhhh...” The ancient macaque-resembling, lightning-wielding Quasi-emperor roared, soon suffering serious injuries, stumbling back, and struck by [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei's] punch. It was unknown how many huge stars he had crashed into.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Emperor blood sprayed across the sky like a red river. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor also roared, brandishing the [Four Stars Sword] in fury to destroy the silver dragons that filled the sky. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was also in a state of siege and imminent danger. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This large-scale Quasi-emperor battle seemed to be coming to an end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that the way and the result of this end would make many people sleepless and have nightmares. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, in the surroundings of the battle circle there were already many figures trembling with fear and drawing back, unfortunately the Quasi-emperor battle was not over. Before the outcome of the battle had been decided, this Void would exist forever, others were unable to leave this battlefield or escape, and had to continue to wait here. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu finally breathed a sigh of relief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could see that there would be no more changes. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the appearance of the old man Quasi-emperor, it shouldn’t be an unexpected surprise, but what [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] had planned out in advance. He probably had calculated that he would fall into a calamity during the arrival of the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor, so he had secretly invited an old friend to come assist him. The old man Quasi-emperor, who had been secretive in his movement and trace, and had not shown up in countless years, was thought to have died. However, at the most critical time he appeared and killed Quasi-emperor Mushan. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, these were all Ye Qingyu's guesses. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether the truth was like this or not was no longer important. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Ye Qingyu's mind, there was another question that arose. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor had already dissipated, the so-called Emperor opportunity should have already been taken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whose hands did it fall into? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Ye Qingyudid not expect to receive this opportunity, uhe still wanted to know the final result, not only because of curiosity but that the result was very important. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you thinking?” a voice sounded behind Ye Qingyu. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu spun around, “Elder, you’re back?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This voice naturally belonged to the million-year-old soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides the million-year-old soul, what Ye Qingyu was most surprised about was that Nan Tieyi who had disappeared all of a sudden, was also standing next to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder, big brother Nan Tieyi, where have you been?” Ye Qingyu was relieved to see that the two were uninjured, but couldn't help asking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Went to figure something out.” The million-year-old soul's aura was more and more similar to that of a human. “Boy you wouldn’t have guessed, it really is unexpected, while these high and mighty Quasi-emperors are pecking each other like geese, the Emperor opportunity had been taken away by another person. Hahaha, so funny.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Another person? Who is it?” Ye Qingyu exclaimed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-year-old soul was the suspected reincarnation of the Chaos Demon Emperor, if there really was an Emperor opportunity in the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor, there was the biggest possibility of it falling into the hands of the million-year-old soul. Ye Qingyu had thought about this hypothesis before, but didn’t expect the million-year-old soul to actually say this. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A little girl,” the million-year-old answered. “A pitifully weak little girl, perhaps this is fate.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little girl? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And with pitifully weak strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was surprised. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If her strength was not strong enough, then it would have been impossible for her to enter the Reincarnation Hall. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This...” Ye Qingyu was in disbelief. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-year-old soul shook his head, sighing, “I know you will find it hard to believe, I also cannot believe it till now, but it is true. Adding to this, it was not the little girl who found the Emperor opportunity, but the Emperor opportunity flew out of the Reincarnation Hall, broke through the Void, and directly found the little girl. This matter is so strange. Could it be that the little girl is the reincarnation of a martial arts Emperor? Her luck is simply in defiance of the natural order.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he said this, he sucked his teeth as though his lungs ached, evidently feeling that the matter was too absurd.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was dumbfounded upon hearing this. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it weren’t the million-year-old soul who said this, Ye Qingyu absolutely would have thought it was complete nonsense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor opportunity had taken the initiative to find an owner? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu found it unbelievable, yet it seemed possible on another thought. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, this was an Emperor opportunity. Anything once involved the word ‘Emperor’ would become difficult to measure. No matter what the content was or what kind of thing it was, no one knew. If the so-called opportunity had a spirit, a consciousness, then it was possible for it to choose its own master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Has elder seen the little girl?” After his initial shock, Ye Qingyu asked, “What race is she?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-years soul cast a glance at Ye Qingyu and spread opened his hand as he spoke, “I know what you’re worried about, unfortunately I had only vaguely extrapolated a corner of the information, before I was blocked all of a sudden and couldn’t find out anything more. The luck is too strong, it is most likely that the heavens and earth are secretly protecting this future martial arts Emperor, blocking everything about her. However, there is one thing that I am completely sure of.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Ye Qingyu asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She is not a human,” the million-year-old soul said firmly. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was speechless when he heard these words. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This really was bad news. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the million-year-old soul was not able to specifically find out which race she was. He said with a wry smile, “Don't think too much about it, not only I, it would be difficult for even Quasi-emperors to deduce the whereabouts of this girl. The force of the heavens and earth are protecting her. It is impossible to use or kill her. We can only wait, wait until the lucky child rises in defiance of the natural order, and perhaps the outside world would be aware of a glimmer of clue.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As long as it is not a person of the Four Stars Sect or an enemy of the Human Race.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu comforted himself. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, previously Ye Qingyu had guessed that [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] had obtained the Emperor opportunity, which was why everybody wanted to kill him at all costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It turned out not to be the case. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, well, now is not the time to focus on these matters. The immediate opportunity must not be missed.” The million-year-old soul waved his hand and pointed to the other spectating experts nearby, “Look, they have already reacted.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu looked over, only to see that the Four Stars holy girl, the [Fatally Beautiful Fairy] Jiang Xiaohan, the successor of the Sky Meteor Sect and the Crown Prince of the Black Demon Abyss were already sitting cross-legged in the Void, shrouded in light flames all over and activating yuan qi to protect themselves. At the same time they, who seemed to be absorbing something, were in a very solemn state. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other experts were basically the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A golden python dharma body was in the Void opening its mouth wide as though swallowing the essence of the moon. In the vast pitch-black sky, there were wisps of light violet qi being swallowed into its mouth in large mouthfuls.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the essence of Quasi-emperor Mushan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu finally had understanding dawning on his face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperor Mushan had fallen. His dharma body had dissipated between the heavens and earth, but the energy and essence that the Dharma body contained were not completely annihilated, but were diffusing. How frightening was the energy that the Dharma body of a Quasi-emperor contained, which existed in abundance across a radius of tens of thousands of kilometers, and instantly turned the starry sky into the cultivation grounds of an Immortal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These experts had reacted long ago, swallowing the remnant energy of Quasi-emperor Mushan's Dharma body. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sort of power was the essence of a Quasi-emperor Dharma body, contained Emperor will, and the slightest trace could bring about great changes. Not to mention that this time the remnants of Emperor power in the Void was so strong. For many experts, it was simply inexhaustible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was simply an unparalleled blessing. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you doing standing there in a daze? You two stand apart a little,” the million-year-old soul excitedly roared, turned into a stream of light, speeding off into the distance, and activated a mysterious technique. He opened up all his pores and frantically absorbed the violet qi in the cosmic starry sky. He needed a lot of energy to refine the Immortal body, and in the future would require much more for full integration and recovery. What could be happier than devouring the essence of a fallen Quasi-emperor? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, after refining the Immortal body, in his weakest state, he still chose to come to this battlefield. His purpose was to wait for this moment, swallow the essence and power of the fallen Quasi-emperor, and store up power in preparation for his long recovery. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu looked at Nan Tieyi.&nbsp;</span></p>
