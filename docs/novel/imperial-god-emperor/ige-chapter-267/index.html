 <p>She had not seen him for a very long time, but Song Qingluo was able to recognise him at first glance.</p>
 <p>It was Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>This youth that did not join any groups and lived apart from others, this youth that walked alone in White Deer academy. From the perspective of the majority of students of the same year, he was somewhat cold and emotionless. Song Qingluo did not have much contact with him, there were only several interactions between the two. Furthermore, these brief interactions were all to stop Song Xiaojun from associating with him.</p>
 <p>Compared to previously, the white clothed youth in front of her, at this moment emitted a charming radiance.</p>
 <p>A year had not even passed, but right now, not even the students that who came from the most powerful and significant families in White Deer academy could be compared to this student who had emerged from the poor. After carefully thought, even the people in Deer city could not be compared to this poor student. Perhaps the only entity capable of standing on even footing with him was the famous Qin family that the City Lord belonged to.</p>
 <p>"Junior sister Song, long time no see."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had a faint smile as he greeted her.</p>
 <p>Just now, he had broken out of his isolation training. He had activated the [Second Limit] of the [Limitless divine way], and instantly had a battle power that was comparable or even greater than the Bitter Sea stage. This was an extremely profound feeling. At that moment, Ye Qingyu felt that he had no way of controlling his own power. That's why such a abnormal scenery had appeared where it snowed throughout the land, and his consciousness spread out like the ocean everywhere. That's the reason why suddenly discovered Song Qingluo's aura with shock.</p>
 <p>That was the reason why he had appeared.</p>
 <p>He did not imagine he would really see Song Qingluo.</p>
 <p>"Senior brother Ye." Song Qingluo hurriedly paid her respects.</p>
 <p>Her heart began to fiercely beat.</p>
 <p>"I did not expect to see Junior sister Song here." Seeing someone that he once knew, Ye Qingyu was in a great mood. Asking, " Could it be that the White Deer academy has come to Youyan pass, to use it as a place to gain experience and train?"</p>
 <p>"No, no, I've already handed in my notice to leave the White Deer academy." Song Qingluo had a dim face.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's eyebrows perked up: "Oh, what happened?"</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo recounted the tale of the Song family briefly.</p>
 <p>So it was like this.</p>
 <p>When Song Xiaojun had participated in the ambush to kill Lu Zhaoge that day, Ye Qingyu had guessed that this matter would have some far reaching effects. But he did not imagine, that the Song family would fall like so. Within the Deer city, the Qingluo merchant company could be counted as a vast entity. But within the entire Snow Empire, when it was compared to the true top level financial organisations, it was miniscule like a speck of dust. Even if Lu Zhaoge did not pursue this matter but there were many forces trying their best to please Lu Zhaoge that would definitely not let the Song family get off easily.</p>
 <p>"Master." Bai Yuanxing came over, recounting everything that had happened roughly.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was alarmed after hearing this.</p>
 <p>To imagine that there would be such a matter that had nearly occurred.</p>
 <p>If she had not encountered Wen Wan, then Song Qingluo would be....</p>
 <p>"Marquis."</p>
 <p>"We pay our respect to Marquis."</p>
 <p>Dugu Dixiu and Dugu Tianxin both hurriedly came over to pay their respects, giving their apologies at the first opportunity.</p>
 <p>The two were extremely uncertain and worried, worried that Ye Qingyu would be enraged and not willing to let the matter rest.</p>
 <p>"En, thank you for the matters today." Ye Qingyu's complexion was calm as he said thanks."Originally I wanted to go to Hundred herb hall to pay my respects to my sworn brother, but I've only just left closed isolation training, so I still have some matters to take care off. Can you tell my sworn brother, that I will definitely pay him a visit tomorrow." As he spoke to here, he pointed to the Song Qingluo beside him. "This Miss Song, is my good friend. Please take care of her."</p>
 <p>"How would we dare not follow Marquis's request." Dugu Tianxin quickly rushed to guarantee that he would do as Ye Qingyu directed.</p>
 <p>Dugu Dixiu told Ye Qingyu of the arrangements that he had made for the Song family, worried that Ye Qingyu would be dissatisfied with his plans.</p>
 <p>"How does sister Song feel about this?" Ye Qingyu turned to look at Song Qingluo.</p>
 <p>"Very good, it's enough, it's enough." Song Qingluo quickly said.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu smiled, turning his head to regard the Dugu brothers: "Then you have my thanks."</p>
 <p>The two quickly rushed to say they don't dare accept his thanks.</p>
 <p>After such simple exchanges, it was enough for the two to realise that this Marquis Ye really did regard this girl significantly. The two secretly planned that they must definitely protect the safety of Song Qingluo when they entered the Proud sky centre. As long as they were able to achieve this, this would be their greatest gain from coming to Youyan pass.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was about to say something, when his gaze shifted, seeing a figure far away. A thought striking him, he turned towards Song Qingluo: "I still have matters attend to, so I need to go first. If you have time, Junior sister Qingluo, you can come to White Horse tower to talk about old times. It’s good to reminisce about the past ."</p>
 <p>"Thank you senior brother Ye."</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo sincerely gave her thanks.</p>
 <p>She knew, the reason that she was able to be released from her nightmares, the reason that even people as important as the Dugu brothers would be so courteous to her, was because of the youth in front of him.</p>
 <p>This youth was once the same as her, but today their breed were completely different.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>White Horse tower.</p>
 <p>"Hey, don't try to bluff me, you've really entered into the Bitter sea stage?" Wen Wan walked circles around Ye Qingyu, not understanding what he saw.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu shook his head: "Just how could it be so easy. It's not even been a year from entering the White Deer academy to now."</p>
 <p>"But the abnormal scenery in the land, that aura......" Wen Wan said, not quite believing in his words.“</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not conceal anything. "This is due to the technique that I’ve cultivated in. In an instant, I can posses a battle power that can be compared to the Bitter Sea stage, it cannot last long.....But even if it was only for an instant, I still received significant benefits. I can faintly feel the power of the Bitter Sea stage. The reason they are called top level experts, is not only because of the vastness of their inner yuan. It's a type of sensation that is akin to the Dao. But it was a pity that this lasted too short a time and the sensation is too unclear. I cannot truly grasp anything as of yet.”</p>
 <p>WEn Wan had his mouth gaping wide open, like he was staring at a fiend. After half a moment, he cursed: "Monster."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu smiled proudly.</p>
 <p>He thought of the time that he was at White Deer academy. Everytime he finished speaking to Wen Wan, he would show off his martial footwork, disappearing in a flash. Right now, this person who liked to show off, was finally shocked by Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"Then what's your cultivation right now?" Wen Wan asked once again.</p>
 <p>Previously, he was able to sense what Ye Qingyu's inner yuan cultivation was. But ever since Ye Qingyu had left closed isolation training, Wen Wan no longer had any way of seeing through Ye Qingyu's level of cultivation. This made him shocked.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu faintly smiled.</p>
 <p>Sixty snow dragon mirages roared out from within his body, illusory but looking real. It emitted roar after roar, coiling around his body, like dragons protecting its master. It's fierce aura emanated everywhere, silver radiance shining off him. A mighty draconic aura spread throughout, causing the air of the quiet room to become turbulent, making Ye Qingyu seem like a War God reborn.</p>
 <p>"Sixty spirit springs?"</p>
 <p>Wen Wan was taken aback.</p>
 <p>In less than a year of time, to cultivate to sixty spirit springs. Even for a genius, this needed at least ten or twenty years of time before it could be achieved. This was far too terrifying. Wen Wan was truly shocked. He could be sure, that there must be some sort of secret hiding within Ye Qingyu's body or this would absolutely defy all common sense.</p>
 <p>However, it was only a cultivation of sixty Spirit springs. That should not be enough to cloud even him from discerning his true cultivativation level.</p>
 <p>Of course, Wen Wan would definitely not display such shock and suspicions.</p>
 <p>"En, it's about average. You have the right to enter into the Proud sky centre, but it's only that, this is still somewhat difficult to crush the geniuses of the sects." Wen Wan pretended he was not surprised at all, speaking in an advising tone.</p>
 <p>"I naturally have other ways." Ye Qingyu chuckled, then remembered: "Why are you so idle? There's nothing to do in the Vanguard?"</p>
 <p>Wen Wan guffawed: "My military post has already been transferred to the White Horse tower."</p>
 <p>“Just when was this?" This time Ye Qingyu was really alarmed.</p>
 <p>"Several days ago." Wen Wan stated triumphantly. "Hehe, Marquis Ye, right now I am your subordinate. Arrange something that's not too hard for me to do, after all we were once teacher and student."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was speechless.</p>
 <p>"Just do whatever you want. Do you think I could actually command you?" Ye Qingyu kneaded his head. "Did you really do your best to leave the Vanguard, just because you wanted to laze about here?"</p>
 <p>Wen Wan smiled proudly but did not say anything.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu shook his head.</p>
 <p>"Just what are you planning to do later?" Wen Wan changed the subject. "The disturbance you caused today was too great. You've most likely already attracted the attention of many parties. The Martial meeting still has three days before it begins, you should temporarily avoid the spotlight.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu smiled: "What am I going to do? Of course I am going to continue to remain in closed isolation training.</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Wen Wan was thoughtful.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu once again entered closed isolation training.</p>
 <p>There were still about ten pounds of Origin crystals left from thirty pounds.</p>
 <p>But he could not longer rely on it to increase his cultivation level. Increasing thirty Spirit springs in one go, was already the limit. Origin crystal was a great material, but he could not rely on it too much. As the saying goes, the highest building starts from the stablest foundation. The stable foundation was the most important thing about high buildings. There would be a long period of time after this where Ye Qingyu would not use the Origin crystal to absorb yuan power anymore. What was important currently, was to stabilise his current cultivation state.</p>
 <p>He was like a child that had grown up overnight. He needed to get accustomed to his new body. Therefore Ye Qingyu needed to quickly adjust to the vast yuan qi power within his body.</p>
 <p>Time flew by.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, it was the afternoon of the third day.</p>
 <p>Tomorrow morning, it was the day of the Martial alliance meeting.</p>
 <p>The streets a thousand metres outside Proud sky centre, were utterly packed, completely filled with people. All the tall buildings around had already been completely booked, and there were even people that began constructing make shift wooden towers. There were already people in the tall trees positioned around Proud sky centre, and the army had sent numerous patrolling squads to maintain order.</p>
 <p>The top floors of the various restaurants and inns in various directions, had already been completely booked and being sold off for an insane price.</p>
 <p>All sorts of large merchant companies had already arrived.</p>
 <p>All the experts of the large sects, had also largely arrived at the Proud sky centre. Even from far away, many people was still able to sense fluctuation after fluctuation. For so many martial artists to gather at once, even normal people could sense the yuan qi currents was different from normal.</p>
 <p>The sunset was like blood.</p>
 <p>There was a restless aura flowing in the tranquil air.</p>
 <p>The White Horse tower was four miles away from the Proud sky centre, standing tall like a mountain.</p>
 <p>Under the illumination of the setting sun, the body of the tower seemed like it was dyed in blood.</p>
 <p>This was one of the focal points that everyone focused on.</p>
 <p>Everyone knew, that one of the movers and shakers of Youyan pass, Marquis Ye had always remained in closed isolation training these days.</p>
 <p>The martial meeting at the Proud sky centre, was an event where the sects could collectively demonstrate their muscles. This was a true clash between the army and the Jianghu. Only people who truly understood the inner affairs, would realise just what this meeting represented. The result of this meeting would not only affect the balance at Youyan pass, it would also be enough to affect the balance of the entire Snow Empire.</p>
 <p>For the Youyan army, if one carefully looked at the prodigies of the younger generation that had emerged in the last decades that could truly be comparable to the geniuses of the sects, one could only find two.</p>
 <p>One had turned into a demon.</p>
 <p>One was within White Hose tower.</p>
 <p>The gazes of the soldiers patrolling on the streets were filled with expectation as they gazed upon White Horse tower.</p>
 <p>The army regarded glory importantly.</p>
 <p>Glory was like their life.</p>
 <p>The fame in JIanghu, the achievements of a soldier, were two things that could make men shed blood the most.</p>
 <p>At this moment, both parties did not want to abandon this battle over glory.</p>
 <p>The Youyan army had defended the borders for tens of years. Blocking the powerful demon race so it could not advance south another step. Everyone in the world knew of such a great achievement. They did not want to be suppressed by the sects, even in a field that they did not specialise in. It was unknown who said it first, or who thought of it first, but everyone's hopes were placed on the master of White Horse tower.</p>
 <p>The last glimmer of sunlight disappeared from the tower.</p>
 <p>The sky gradually turned into a dim blue colour.</p>
 <p>Lights began to be lit from all directions.</p>
 <p>There was an abrupt yuan qi fluctuation in the air. It was as if there was a vast ocean hanging in the middle of the air that was currently turbulently swirling. Yuan qi swirls were generated, and it seemed like the space all around had turned into grit. A gigantic foot covered by black clouds, suddenly appeared without any warning whatsoever. It was as it broke through a screen in the air, stomping down from the blue sky high above.</p>
 <p>The entire Youyan pass, seemed to be vibrating as a result of this.</p>
 <p>The giant foot fell.</p>
 <p>The place where it was landing towards, was namely the White Horse tower.</p>
 <p>The White Horse tower that had stood for sixty years in White Horse tower, crumbled like a large rock striking wheat. It suddenly bent, then broke, then turned to dust.</p>
 <p>Before the rock and dust could even rise up, this giant foot once again stomped down from the sky.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>A giant foot print, metres deep, replaced the area where White Horse tower had once stood.</p>
 <p>A black yuan qi current was swirling.</p>
 <p>All of the surrounding architecture around White Horse tower, were surprisingly unaffected.</p>
 <p>The giant foot instantly disappeared.</p>
 <p>A dense black aura emanated in the air.</p>
 <p>The ripples in the air dissipated.</p>
 <p>This entire process, happened in less than two or three breaths.</p>
 <p>In the time of the spark of a flint, everything was settled. It was so fast one could not react at all.</p>
 <p>Only when the giant foot disappeared, did people began to react.</p>
 <p>"Who dares."</p>
 <p>A clear and low shout, boomed out from the direction of the Pass Lord's Residence. A golden radiance like the morning sun rising, broke through the air, breaking apart the barriers of space. It pierced the direction where the giant foot had once appeared. There was a flash, and in an instant, it disappeared to who knows where.</p>
 <p>There was a low grunt that emitted from within the air.</p>
 <p>Xiu!Xiu!Xiu!</p>
 <p>Tens of lights shot out from various directions in the city, appearing in an instant above White Horse tower.</p>
 <p>"They deserve to die!"</p>
 <p>"The tower has turned to dust....."</p>
 <p>"The people in the tower...."</p>
 <p>"Who was it?"</p>
 <p>There were shouts of rage. The first people who appeared at the scene, were the experts from the Youyan army.</p>
 <p>[The Butcher of Youyan], Liu Siufeng was within this group.</p>
 <p>Liu Siufeng was both shocked and enraged as he stared at the three toed footprint hundreds of metres in size below. He descended instnatly, his consciousness spreading out like a flood. He wanted to see if he could still detect anyone still alive, especially Ye Qingyu.....</p>
 <p>He hoped that this little brat, was not within the tower......</p>
