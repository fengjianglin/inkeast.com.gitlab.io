<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Ye Qingyu felt that his entire person was about to burn up.</p>
 <p>His entire person was like he was drunk. He began to feel dizzy and woozy.</p>
 <p>the nameless breathing technique naturally activated.</p>
 <p>Large beads of sweat began seeping out from the pores of his skin.</p>
 <p>What also came out was some murky and sticky substance. Ye Qingyu already had no energy to see just what kind of substance it was because he felt that within this burning sensation, there was a strange energy that was currently being born.</p>
 <p>This kind of power was especially evident in his dantian world.</p>
 <p>It was as if something was currently being born in his dantian world.</p>
 <p>"This power is somewhat familiar... I seem to have seen it somewhere." Ye Qingyu had a strange sensation that such a power had once appeared within his own body, but he could not recall it at this moment in time.</p>
 <p>Time began to flow on, bit by bit.</p>
 <p>They finally arrived at the eighteenth zone.</p>
 <p>This was the last zone</p>
 <p>After they finished traversing this fog zone, they should have truly reached the legendary palace of the [Base of the Formation Sovereign]. At that time, they would be able to tell whether the legacy of the [Formation Sovereign], Luoso, was contained within.</p>
 <p>On the way, they had met with too many experts that had died in battle.</p>
 <p>Within such a group were existences that had truly stepped into the Bitter Sea stage. However, they had also failed in their struggles and turned into corpses on the ground, unable to return forever.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was currently in a stange woozy state. Without stopping in the slightest, he directly headed towards the eighteen zone.</p>
 <p>"Little brother, you really have guts. To not wear clothes and enter, you must be the first. I am impressed." Ximen Yeshui gave him the thumbs up and followed closely behind.</p>
 <p>The instant they entered into the eighteenth zone, an unprecedented pressure from the [Fog of Annihilation] came over them. It surged towards them from every direction.</p>
 <p>Even Ximen Yeshui had a serious expression at this time. A faint layer of water circled around his body. The power of water attribute aura emanated from him, blocking the destructive power of the [Fog of Annihilation].</p>
 <p>At this time, he dared not pretend. He paid attention to Ye Qingyu's situation, preparing to give aid at any moment if he needed it.</p>
 <p>What made him confused was that with Ye Qingyu's evident strength, he could tell that he was only at the sixty Spirit springs of cultivation. With Ye Qingyu's age, he could be counted as prodigious, but he should have no way of withstanding the destructive power of the fog of the eighteenth zone.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu still continued to walk on. The yuan qi around his body was completely destroyed, but could his flesh body withstand such pressure head-on?</p>
 <p>"He really is a monster, no wonder..."</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui seemed to have thought of something.</p>
 <p>As for Ye Qingyu, right now, he was completely isolated from the world.</p>
 <p>The destructive power of the eighteenth zone caused one to shiver.</p>
 <p>As the pressure increased, when the fiery heat in his body reached its pinnacle, it was as if there was an ancient and vast roar of a dragon resounding from his consciousness.</p>
 <p>That right, a dragon's roar.</p>
 <p>Then an unexpected change occurred.</p>
 <p>Faintly, there was a light that appeared in front of them that tore apart the endless mists.</p>
 <p>An expression of complete shock and dumbfoundedness appeared on Ye Qingyu's face</p>
 <p>Because in the endless light, he could see a tall and almighty Sky Dragon. It had appeared within his vision, it's gaze piercing through the air. It floated in the air, along with the sun and moon, staring at Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>The might of this Sky Dragon was like a god amongst dragons. Ye Qingyu felt like he was a speck of dust in front of it. There were bolts of lightning encircling around it, rain and wind following it, light dimming everywhere. It had a massive body in the air, but an unexplainable speed. It coiled around the stars, the stars not even a size of it's scale. Resplendent specks of light surrounded his body...</p>
 <p>It was as if everything around him completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>there was only Ye Qingyu and the Sky Dragon in this entire world left.</p>
 <p>It was as if time and space had already lost all meaning.</p>
 <p>Just what was happening?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was extremely shocked.</p>
 <p>Before he could make any sort of reaction, that incomparably large head shot towards him from above. The head of the dragon was like an asteroid that struck towards him. Before Ye Qingyu could react in the least, it had struck Ye Qingyu's body.</p>
 <p>There was not any pain.</p>
 <p>Nor was there any impact.</p>
 <p>The instant it made contact with Ye Qingyu's body, the inexplicably large draconic head seemed to have assimilated within Ye Qingyu's body. Like a gust of wind, this terrifying impact and pressure completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>It was not only the dragon's head.</p>
 <p>At that same time, the body that was so vast and towering that the stars were only specks, the body of the Sky Dragon, had all rushed within Ye Qingyu's body. In the time of a spark, the huge Sky Dragon had completely disappeared. It was as if it had turned into part of Ye Qingyu's body, once again returning within Ye Qingyu's body.</p>
 <p>The endless light disappeared in front of him.</p>
 <p>The strange burning sensation of his body also completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's consciousness began to recover.</p>
 <p>The terrifying pressure of the [Fog of Annihilation] still struck towards him.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu struggled to open his eyes.</p>
 <p>Everything had returned to normal.</p>
 <p>The scene that had just appeared seemed to be an illusion.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui had a complete face of shock, as if he had seen a ghost. His eyes were wide, and he stood there frozen beside Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"What are you looking at me like that for..."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu opened his mouth to speak.</p>
 <p>But inexplicably, what came out of his mouth was not the language of the Human Race.</p>
 <p>A dragon's roar, like the anger of a thunderstorm, sounded beside his head.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was taken aback.</p>
 <p>He subconsciously looked about everywhere. But they were still within the fog zone. However, the moment he caught a glimpse of his hand, he stood there frozen.</p>
 <p>Becase his hand... was no longer a human's hand.</p>
 <p>It was a dragon's claw.</p>
 <p>A claw that was covered with faint silver dragon's scales, flickering with the light of the stars. A dragon claw that was sharp like heaven's blade.</p>
 <p>Along with the dragon's claw, it was the dragon's limb.</p>
 <p>Dragon's body.</p>
 <p>"What is this..." As Ye Qingyu spoke, a clear dragon's roar resounded throughout the environment. At this time, Ye Qingyu could be sure that the dragon's roar had originated from his mouth.”</p>
 <p>He turned around to have a look.</p>
 <p>The hundred-meter-long dragon's body had silver scales ficerking. It was filled with an explosive sense of beauty. A pressure that only the Dragon Race had, began seeping out from within the dragon's body. The [Fog of Annihilation] nearly did not dare come near it in the slightest. The dragon's body slowly floated throughout the air, and there were faint signs of lighting that followed along it, tracing the beautiful curve of it's body.</p>
 <p>"I..."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had nearly lost his ability of speech.</p>
 <p>He could not believe everything he saw.</p>
 <p>He began to understand Ximen Yeshui's gaze, like someone who had seen a ghost.</p>
 <p>Because he had already understood what had occurred.</p>
 <p>He had turned into a dragon.</p>
 <p>He had turned into a silver Sky Dragon.</p>
 <p>And the silly dog Little Nine that had always bitten onto Ximen Yeshui's leg, also had an expression that wondered if he was dreaming. He had long unconsciously loosened his mouth, his mouth gaping wide open as he stared at Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"Woof... master, you... you've completely... transformed. Or have you shown your original form?" He asked dumbly.</p>
 <p>"I must be dreaming..." Ximen Yeshui gave himself a hard smack on the face.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's gaze swept around his body.</p>
 <p>With a thought, he controlled his ice yuan qi to appear in front of him, and formed an ice mirror. The image on the mirror evidently showed his appeared. He was namely a silver Sky Dragon that was a hundred meters long. It was the same as what he saw in the illusion, only that he was much smaller. He was like an infantile dragon, but he already had the form of a divine dragon.</p>
 <p>It was him.</p>
 <p>It was Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>He had transformed into a dragon.</p>
 <p>Transformed into a silver Sky Dragon.</p>
 <p>A flicker of light flitted in Ye Qingyu's minds. He suddenly understood.</p>
 <p>This was the martial path of Draconification.</p>
 <p>In the past, when at the Snow Dragon's Den within the Explosive Snow Glacier, that slumbering mysterious figure that had awakened from the sleep of billions of years had once mentioned that he had passed on the true martial will of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] to Ye Qingyu. He had planted a martial seed of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] within Ye Qingyu's dantian.</p>
 <p>At that time, Ye Qingyu had only comprehended about ten percent of this seed.</p>
 <p>Therefore, when his ice yuan qi leaked outside his body, although it had the shape and form of silver dragons, it was only the form. It did not possess the true might of a Sky Dragon.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, Ye Qingyu returned to Youyan Pass, and because of the conflict between the Jianghu and the army, he could not calm his heart to comprehend the [True Will of the Sky Dragon]. He could not take a step in the direction of this true martial will.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Ye Qingyu's understanding towards the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] was not complete.</p>
 <p>He had always imagined that the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] was a powerful yuan qi offensive technique. Therefore, he began making efforts in such a direction, but he was ultimately not able to make much progress. It was only at this moment when Ye Qingyu understood that the true might of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] was not to train his qi, but to refine his body.</p>
 <p>The [True Will of the Sky Dragon] was a martial secret that had to do with body refining.</p>
 <p>Therefore, within the [Fog of Annihilation], when his body was under attack by the disordered destructive power, under such humongous pressure, Ye Qingyu was able to accidentally used the nameless breathing technique to activate the seed that the mysterious figure had left behind. He had manage to awaken such power, and the power of will burned throughout his body. Finally, under such a condition, Ye Qingyu had finally managed to utterly comprehend the [True Will of the Sky Dragon].</p>
 <p>Any true martial will, once it was fully comprehended, one would obtain a divine ability.</p>
 <p>The draconic form of Ye Qingyu was evidently the ultimate ability of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon].</p>
 <p>Ever since the Dragon Race was born, they had the most powerful battle power. In the God and Devil Age, the Dragon Race, Divine Race and Devil Race where the invincible races of the Vast Thousand Worlds. They were natural born warriors.</p>
 <p>Under such a state, Ye Qingyu's body had risen to an abnormally powerful state.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu controlled his body facing the ice mirror.</p>
 <p>The white-coloured Sky Dragon in the mirror moved according to what he willed.</p>
 <p>When his dragon claws closed and opened, Ye Qingyu felt that his strength was invincible. It far exceeded the power of his human form. If heaven and earth had a hoop, then he could completely grab the hoop and drag Heaven and Earth together using his physical power.</p>
