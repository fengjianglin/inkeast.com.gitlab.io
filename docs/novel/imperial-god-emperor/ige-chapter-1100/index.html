 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless pairs of eyes bulged with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What just happened?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Has the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect been beheaded?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless people rubbed their eyes in unison, unable to believe what they had just witnessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The loud cheers and waving of swords in the Four Stars Sect's camp came to an abrupt halt, as though a flock of noisy ducks had suddenly been strangled simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the pair of flying swords hit their target in one strike, they howled happily as though they were alive. Then, they trembled as one, like a pair of wings that could not wait to soar in the sky, and looked as though they were about to rip through the air and escape…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Come back here!" Ye Qingyu roared and spat out a mouthful of blood essence that landed on the Geng Metal Pill. At the same time, he also imprinted several ancient and secret handprints onto the Geng Metal Pill. This pill immediately shone with grand splendor and let out a soft but long cry, like a loving mother calling out for her son who had traveled far from home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pair of winged swords buzzed reluctantly but ultimately stopped struggling and returned to the Geng Metal Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu summoned a white jade pill furnace that was at least ten meters tall and stored this Geng Metal Pill within this pill furnace. Then, he stored this pill furnace within the [Cloud Top Cauldron].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He heaved a long sigh of relief after this process was complete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the opposite end—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor's head continued to plummet. It fell several thousand meters before crashing to the ground with a thunderous boom. The earth shook and mountains trembled, as though there had been an earthquake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor's body remained frozen in the void. No blood had flowed out of the wound at his neck and his body still continued to exude a frightening force as he stood in the void without falling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How dare you sneak up on him…" the sect master yelled from a distance. He looked a little flustered but there was no trace of fear on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He firmly believed that his ancestor would definitely be able to reconstruct his head. Even ordinary Saint experts would be able to use their blood qi to reconstruct their heads after they were beheaded, so this was a simple task for a revered Quasi-emperor like his ancestor. Their abilities were as remarkable as fiendgods, so there was no way his ancestor would die just because his head had been cut off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Moron." Ye Qingyu's glanced at the sect master of the Four Stars Sect. The dark forces had already eaten away at this man and his mind was already corrupted. He had long lost the graceful bearing of a true sect master. He was so pathetic that he was not even aware of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ancestor?" the sect master of the Four Stars Sect called out, his voice quivering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something was wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why was it taking so long for their Quasi-emperor to reconstruct his head? Several breaths had already passed and this short amount of time was the equivalent of several centuries to a Quasi-emperor, so he should have already shown some reaction by this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strange atmosphere hung in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rest of the experts from the various forces were all completely dumbfounded as they slowly started to think that perhaps the impossible might have happened. Yet, this thought seemed so ridiculous and unbelievable that they could not believe that it could happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ancestor, please regain your divine abilities and kill Madman Ye," the Four Stars Holy Girl said loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Please kill him."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless disciples of the Four Stars Sect chanted as they waved their swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He is already dead," Ye Qingyu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Rubbish. Our ancestor is a Quasi-emperor. There is no way that he could have perished," the sect master roared fiercely but his face was pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Holy Girl scoffed coldly, "Stop trying to mislead everyone with your ridiculous statements… You… must have used some kind of mysterious technique to temporarily seal his powers. Do you really think that you can deceive us? In a few moments, you'll be the first to die after our ancestor regains his strength, then you will be turned to ashes…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She lost her composure and yelled loudly even as she inched backward slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu shook his head but remained silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Geng Metal Pill and the winged swords were the treasures he had obtained from one of the pill furnaces from the [Tusita Palace] in the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor. The million-year-old soul had once hinted to Ye Qingyu that the treasure contained within that pill furnace might be able to help him defeat Quasi-emperor Mushan. Later on, Ye Qingyu barely managed to extract this pill from the pill furnace but had yet to fully refine it, so he did not use it in battle. It was not until recently that he had finally managed to gain some control over the powers of this pill and could control the winged swords with great difficulty. He had done all of that in preparation for the battle today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The winged swords contained within the Geng Metal Pill were incredibly powerful and managed to kill the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect in one strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Quasi-emperor had been felled by a sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a supreme treasure that was at least an Emperor weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at his current stage of cultivation, he was only able to use it once because it would use up almost all his yuan qi. He would need some time to recuperate before he could use it again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, this one strike had been enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, countless fearful and reverent gazes fell on him. Everyone looked at this young man in robes like white jade as though they were looking at a legendary figure. This young man had battled a Quasi-emperor and even beheaded him but emerged completely unscathed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It has to be a lie, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They kept asking themselves this question over and over again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Madman Ye… is he truly human?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who had been prepared to stand with the Four Stars Sect immediately retreated at the first instance to move as far away as they could from the Four Stars Sect, as though they were avoiding a plague. They did not want to be associated with the Four Stars Sect at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They reacted in the exact same manner as they had earlier when they avoided Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things were quickly going downhill for the Four Stars Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Attack!" Ye Qingyu retreated to the divine temple and issued a command with a slight raise of his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spokesperson Li, the four main generals, the successor of White Jade Capital, Lu Wei, Li Shengyan, and the others were not aware that Ye Qingyu had such an incredible weapon. They were all as shocked as the experts from the Four Stars Sect and their minds were completely blank. They had been prepared to battle to the death, so no one had expected that things would turn out this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were only pulled out of their reverie by Ye Qingyu's call to arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Kill!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Charge!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four main generals yelled out military commands in unison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Military drums thundered in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">White Cloud Warships appeared along the horizon and ripped through the air to surround the battlefield. They looked incredibly imposing, and it was just as though huge white clouds had swept over the battlefield. Dozens of White-robed Divine Guards stood sternly on every warship. And at a glance, there appeared to be several thousand soldiers aboard them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were the core, elite soldiers of the White-robed Divine Guards of the Human Race headquarters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Cloud Warships had the ability to battle across domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The military drums' thunderous, ear-splitting booms pulled many other experts out of their shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The true battle was about to begin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ancestor…" the sect master cried, completely grief-stricken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a veil covering the Four Stars Holy Girl's features, but the fear and panic in her eyes were as clear as day and she started to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the [Fatally Beautiful Fairy], Jiang Xiaohan, she had disappeared from the scene before anyone knew it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was because the Four Stars Quasi-emperor's headless body still stood in the void and had yet to recover and the authoritative force from his body was gradually dissipating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor was truly dead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Quick, we have to save our ancestor," the sect master yelled as he lunged for the Quasi-emperor's body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Get into your formations and counterattack!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those in the upper echelon of the Four Stars Sect yelled angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Activate our sect gate's formation and kill every one of these White-robed Divine Guards," an ancient elder yelled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The experts who were not from the Four Stars Sect but had been standing in their camp earlier were so frightened that they quaked in their boots.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially true for the Black Moon Immortal Palace because they were in possession of some inside information prior to the battle. They were so sure that the Four Stars Sect would definitely win today that they ignored their sentence by the Alliance of Domains to seal their sect and stood beside the Four Stars Sect so prominently. Now that the situation had turned out this way, their actions were as good as courting death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they remembered their previous enmity with the Heaven Wasteland Domain, those in the upper echelon of the Black Moon Immortal Palace were so overcome with regret that they even thought of killing themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, the Four Stars Sect managed to retrieve the Quasi-emperor's body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also because Ye Qingyu did not stop them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not think much about returning the body to the sect because the Quasi-emperor was already dead. Furthermore, he did not have an inclination to turn every organism into a zombie war puppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Kill! Kill them all!" the sect master yelled angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They still had the support of a dark Quasi-emperor and this was a region that their sect had managed and refined for many millennia. So, these ten thousand White-robed Divine Guards were out of their minds if they thought they could destroy the Four Stars Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was already prepared to raze the place to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also, there was a secret escape passage within their sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He became a little crazed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu swallowed three Deathlike Pills at the divine temple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He exerted his yuan qi to refine those pills, and soon after, his yuan qi had been replenished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Treasures, please make your appearance again," he said as he exerted a mysterious technique and used his handprint to activate the Geng Metal Pill and release the winged swords within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two rays of sword light flashed and ripped through the air, then Ye Qingyu recalled these swords in the same manner as he had done earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, his target was the dark Quasi-emperor who was battling the elderly Quasi-emperor. The winged swords slashed apart the black mist, then a petrified cry rang out. Soon after, the black mist that covered the sky completely scattered and a drop of black blood fell toward the ground. Suddenly, the earth burned with black flames, it was like a sea of fire…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The various experts who had hoped that Ye Qingyu's feat earlier was a fluke were now completely flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clear that this mysterious dark Quasi-emperor had also been killed by Ye Qingyu in the same manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was far too terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was way too frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had killed Quasi-emperors as effortlessly as slaughtering chickens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">God, now that he had such skills and supreme treasures, who else in this universe would be able to block his sword light?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the future, all these forces would be at the [Ice Sword Killing God’s] mercy. Now that Quasi-emperors could not even handle one blow from him, who else would be able to stop him? A true Martial Emperor might possibly be able to achieve this feat, but they did not exist in the universe today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was probably invincible throughout this universe now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was not a Martial Emperor, but his strength was comparable to one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Had the most dominant expert of the late Martial Emperor Age finally emerged?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even a fool could tell that from this day on, there was going to be a major power shift throughout the entire Vast Thousand Domains and this was probably the start of an era where the Human Race would reign supreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, military drums boomed in the distance once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a very unique drumming sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, huge Dragon Human warships appeared in such a large number that they blotted out the sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Human War God, Xu Wuya, stood high and tall on his warship as his eyes blazed with combat will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Human Race headquarters was not fighting alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White-robed Divine Guards had allies as well.</span></p>
