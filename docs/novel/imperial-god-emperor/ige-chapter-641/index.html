 <p>Chapter 641, The flashbacks of the former days</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the fire tree woods.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This power...” Bai Yuanxing suddenly stopped his training.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He listened attentively like always and his face took on a look of surprise. Feeling the terrifying power roaring like a wild beast from the direction of the palace, and feeling the yuan qi within his body surging involuntarily, unconsciously he began to tremble.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the other side, Jin Ling'er, Li Ying, and Li Qi also turned to the direction of the Light Palace, but the light was too blinding, even if they had exerted their full strength, it was still difficult to face it directly. One after another a pained expression crossed their face. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not far away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The always calm Divine General Gong seemed to have been petrified.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He gripped the slightly worn out broom tightly in his hands, to the extent that the broomstick was crushed by the tremendous palm force into fragments, yet he still had not realized the harm he had caused. There was a sudden change in his usual calm expression, solemnly gazing in the direction of the palace. He looked somewhat emotional, and not sure when, but there was a teardrop flowing down his cheeks.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Finally, the moment I’ve been waiting for...”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He, who was always calm and kept a straight face even when facing the Demon King of a foreign race, had never lost control like this before.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The third area of Light City.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“On the divine palace ...”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That is... the Divine Sword of Light?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The Divine Sword of Light is activated?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Could it be that Lord...”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yang Henshui of the martial training grounds, as well as Gao Han, Dai Youmeng, and Liu Jinyan in the tent almost at the same time abruptly stopped what they were doing and turned to the direction of the Light Palace. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yang Henshui's hand that was clasping the cool and elegant weapon was slightly trembling, and the weapon was also producing bursts of strange cries.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gao Han moved two steps closer to the palace, feeling the vast and undefendable oppressive power growing stronger, then slowed down his pace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A year ago, he had seen Lord Ye repeatedly activate the sword of light when he was trapped in the Light Palace. But today, it was a very different strength and tyrannical power of the divine sword, which made him afraid, but also gave birth to infinite reverence. He gazed distantly at the overhead of the palace where a pillar of light was seen towering into the sky. When he thought again of the only person in the entire Heaven Wasteland who could activate the Divine Sword of Light, he couldn't help feeling emotionally moved.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Since the Battle at Youyan Pass, he had been following Lord Ye for almost two years. During this period of time he had witnessed many of Lord Ye's fortuitous encounters and breakthroughs. Moreover, under his leadership, he also had done many heroic feats, which benefited the Human Race, that he could not even imagine doing in his previous life. He not only had admiration, respect, trust, and reverence for Lord Ye, but the strange scene before him made him feel that the Lord Ye, who he followed, was a God-like existence in the Human Race of Heaven Wasteland Domain...</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Dai Youmeng and Liu Jinyan were already shivering in fear from the power.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two people thought of the various heavenly lightning and strange scenes in the war back then. It was incredibly difficult to imagine that the Sword of Light would reappear and what earth-shattering events it would bring about again…</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the market of the Snow capital.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Crouching in front of a simple noodle shop that did not even have a shop plate, Wen Wan was slurping up noodles in big mouthfuls, when suddenly, like he was struck by lightning, he went completely still.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Boom!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The silver pillar pierced the clouds, and the light covered the rays of the sun, illuminating the entire Snow capital.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>At the same time——&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Clang!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wen Wan's wrist trembled, the large bowl of noodles spilled onto the ground, but he seemed to have not yet realized.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His eyes filled with shock as he looked up at the western direction of the Snow capital. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wen Wan seemed to have all of a sudden lost consciousness. Very quickly his eyes were rekindled with excitement, trembling uncontrollably. He looked at the direction of the distant pillar of silver light for more than ten seconds, before he, like a madman, burst into a wild laughter. “Hahahaha... this day, finally came.....”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In the noodle shop.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The others were exchanging glances with one another.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The first brothel of Snow capital, Light Dance building.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In a room on the second floor.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hugging girls on his left and right, Li Changkong and Ximen Yeshui abruptly sprang up beside the wine table, exchanged a glance, and with a flash they were already in the middle of the air.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the same time——&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Boom!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The pillar of light pierced a mass of clouds at the other end of the Snow capital, and seemed to be charging to the end of the sky.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That is... from the direction of the Light Palace?” Xiemen Yeshui exclaimed, his eyes wide open and fixed in the direction of the silver pillar of light and the cloud cyclone, revealing a strange and puzzled look, “Could it be my precious brother doing something extraordinary again, and even lit up the Light Palace?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Yes, it is indeed the power of the Divine Sword of Light.” Li Changkong felt a surging yuan qi in his body, “But... this power, how is it... so strong...” He had never seen such a strong force, which seemed to exist only in legends.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this time, at the ground floor of the restaurant.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The few beautiful female singers who were crowding around the two men all popped their heads out of the window, looking curiously at the sky.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Gongzi Ximen, you run when the sky changes, you even forgot your bird!” One of the women with a chicken-sized drunk parrot, Rosy Cloud, in her arm shouted.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Yue Yin, why do you think the sky suddenly changed...’ another woman said.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Who knows! A few days ago there was even lightning, recently it hasn't been very peaceful!” a beautiful woman called Yue Yin propped her chin in her hand and said quietly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Above the Imperial family's offering temple.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Within a thin cloud of light smoke, two figures, one black and one white, like immortals riding the clouds, were sat cross legged, motionless, that not even the strong winds fluttered their robes or hair in the slightest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Upon a closer look, it was the Snow Emperor and Hu Yu who had entered a meditative state.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Boom!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A loud noise broke out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hu Yu suddenly shot open his eyes, twisting his head immediately in the direction of Light City.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You lost...” The Snow Emperor slowly opened his eyes, saying in a deep voice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>But if Hu Yu had turned around at this time, he would see that the Snow Emperor's eyes were flashing with astonishment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How many years... how many times have I seen the sun rise and set... I’ve finally waited...” Hu Yu did not care what the Snow Emperor had said. The strongest expert of the empire fixed his eyes on the giant silver sword above the Light Palace. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In the distance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The burst of the silver pillar had as though illuminated the belief hidden deep in his heart. All over his body were yuan qi power surging and whistling, and the insuppressible qi seemed to have set him into flames. The next moment he lifted up his foot, anxiously turning into a stream of flowing light, and darted in the direction of the pillar of light.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the Right Minister's residence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In a quiet room playing chess while discussing the military plan, Right Minister Lin Zheng and Left Minister Qu Hanshan looked at each other, a strange light flickering in their eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two pillars of the Snow Empire, who had always remained calm in the face of anything and were as steady as Mt. Tai, suddenly shattered the chess piece in their hand into dust. Even the thick white jade board was immediately split across and covered in cracks.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There were flashes of light and shadow.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Two shadows flashed into midair, gazing into the silver pillar of light.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Trembling in fear, awe, excitement, and joy...&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Staring at that sword of light and recalling of the grand situation of the empire one hundred years ago, all kinds of complex emotions surfaced on the faces of the two old men. Their lips trembled, but words would not come forth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The Crown Prince Palace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Crown Prince of the Snow Empire Yu Xiaoxing, the First Princess Yu Junqing, and the Golden Apex Prince Yu Feiyan were standing before the sand table at the Snow Empire's borders discussing something.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In a split second, the strange scene suddenly emerged, the three people all revealed a look of astonishment and joy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Waited so long, finally waited for today...” Yu Junqing turned to the silver light in the west side of the palace, sighing slightly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“I knew he could do it!” Yu Xiaoxing’s face lit up, looking in the direction of the center of the silver light pillar, a smile blooming across her face like a flower.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The Divine Sword of Light has appeared in Heaven Wasteland, it seems our previous concerns... were unnecessary...” Yu Feiyan heaved a long sigh of relief, a gratified smile on his face.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the square in front of the residence of the Snow Empire’s Pill God.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Two men with grey hair and beard were standing in the front of a crowd, gazing at the constantly changing light ahead, the rolling mist funnel, as well as the incomparably mighty and sacred silver sword piercing the clouds, and seemed to be unable to contain their joy. The corners of their eyes were slightly suffused with a glowing light.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I didn't think that us two old men would see the day the power of the divine sword would appear again...”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I already said, that boy, compared to that person back then, is not in any way inferior!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Behind the two people, the tide of people attracted by the earth-shaking scene was increasingly growing. It was as if the entire population of Snow capital had rushed out from their house. Everyone was astonished and awed by the magnificent power.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Along with the strange scene in the sky a few days ago, many people began to wonder whether there would be a big change in the Snow capital and even Heaven Wasteland Domain...</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And this vast, imposing, and terrifying scene was also invisibly spreading at a rapid speed in all directions like a tidal wave...</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Youyan Pass.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pass Lord's residence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Lu Zhaoge and Ye Congyun were discussing the deployment of border troops.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Like a tremendous wave of surging power had suddenly descended, it suddenly grabbed the mind of these two people.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Lu Zhaoge looked shocked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The military god who controlled the northern area of the Imperial empire had never lost control like this before. He suddenly seemed to be aware of something, reached out his hand and grasped the arm of Ye Congyun. With a flash of golden light, the next moment, the two were already tens of thousands of meters above the Pass Lord's residence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That is... could it be that he is back!” Lu Zhaoge cried out in surprise.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Looking in the direction of the Snow capital that he was very familiar with, he couldn't control his shock.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Master, who... who's back?” Ye Congyun was both surprised and puzzled. His cultivation base was far inferior to that of Lu Zhaoge. He had only just felt the sudden power coming in the direction of the south-east imperial Snow capital, lifting up a monstrous wave, and all yuan qi were constantly surging.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The War God of Youyan Pass had always remained calm and collected even when facing the millions of troops of the Snow Ground Demon Court.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Congyun had been following Lu Zhaoge for more than a year and had never seen his master so agitated.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the same time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the northernmost of Heaven Wasteland, The Snow Ground Demon Court.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the top of the mysterious ice tower.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An old man who had just issued dozens of military orders suddenly froze, his eyes filled with shock.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“It's him!” The old man was both shocked and very puzzled, and unconsciously revealed a pained expression, “how... could it be him....”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The northwest edge of the Snow Empire.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Desert Brute Race Imperial Court.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On a black altar, the Brute King suddenly quivered. The green light in his eyes began to wander and changed strangely in fear.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“He... it's him... he's back?” The Brute King's heart was trembling with dismay. His face was crossed with fear and panic, and for a moment he ignored the puzzled glances of the dozens of brute warriors below the altar.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the depths of the Snow Empire's northeast forest border.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The White Mountain Black Waters Brute Race Imperial Court. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the offering platform of the Brute Race.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Sensing the mighty and violently surging oppressive power, a black-robed elder in front of the sacred altar suddenly went motionless, as though a great sense of panic and shock had drowned him like a tide.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Next to him, a silver dragon-shaped flame gradually condensed into a substantial matter, as if it had suddenly swallowed the black demonic flame and was about to soar into the air.</p>
 <p><br></p>
