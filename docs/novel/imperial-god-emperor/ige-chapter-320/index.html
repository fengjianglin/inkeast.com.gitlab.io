 <p>Chapter 320 - Elder of the Human Race</p>
 <p>At the side, Little Nine and Little Silver were also screaming repeatedly.</p>
 <p>This whole process lasted one full hour.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu felt that the lightning was about to split his body into particles.</p>
 <p>But unexpectedly, after an hour, the frightening deity-class rumbling of thunder suddenly disappeared.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was exhausted, floating in space.</p>
 <p>Inside the palace, it was incomparably dim.</p>
 <p>Rows of huge old stone bookcases loomed out in the dim light. The shelves were at least hundreds of meters high and all sorts of ancient books were densely packed inside. The spines were flickering with strange words and there was a bizarre and powerful aura coming from the books, as though every book had a terrifying and powerful devil sealed within.</p>
 <p>The bookcases, tier upon tier, were endless, like it was a forest of bookcases.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could not see how big the palace was.</p>
 <p>But he was certain that the bookcases, ancient books and the tens of thousands of books he saw were just a little section of it, like a grain of sand in a desert.</p>
 <p>While he was gaping in astonishment, a figure appeared before his eyes.</p>
 <p>A familiar figure.</p>
 <p>A familiar scent.</p>
 <p>It was the illusionary figure that he had come across in the mysterious cemetery of the Snow Dragon deep inside the snow dragon’s den beneath the Explosive Snow Glacier.</p>
 <p>It was the mysterious person that suddenly awakened from million of years of slumber, saw the abnormality within Ye Qingyu’s body, and taught Ye Qingyu the profound meaning of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] martial path. When he left, he said he was in search to find traces of the past, finding ways to restore his former strength.</p>
 <p>This person was definitely an absolute expert of peerless strength.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu already knew him from before.</p>
 <p>But he did not think that he would meet this man again today at the Moving Imperial Palace of the [Formation Sovereign] Luo So.</p>
 <p>“Elder, it’s you?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu exclaimed.</p>
 <p>“Little friend, we meet again.” The mysterious person was much more real than the last time and not like illusory smoke that would be blown away by the wind at any time. He could vaguely see his face. He had an exceptional aura and there was a smile spread across his face.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t expect to see elder here, it really is...” Ye Qingyu, not knowing what to say, respectfully bowed before he continued, “Really is unexpected. It was elder that saved me?”</p>
 <p>The mysterious person laughed, “Little friend is referring to the divine punishment of thunder and lightning?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded.</p>
 <p>“Not at all, I led it here for you.” The mysterious man laughed.</p>
 <p>“What does elder mean?” Ye Qingyu stared blankly at him.</p>
 <p>“The power of the thunder and lightning of this imperial palace can strengthen the body. This is especially so for people at the Bitter Sea stage, it is the best object to strengthen the body. So after some thought, I led it here for you.” The mysterious man’s gaze flitted over Ye Qingyu, nodding satisfiedly. “Originally, I thought that to be able to master 60% of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] in less than a year of time was already regarded as especially gifted, but I did not think that you were even more impressive and had comprehended it completely. Now, you can even enter into the form of the dragon.”</p>
 <p>He had seen Ye Qingyu’s dragon form trying to escape the gate of the palace.</p>
 <p>“Elder you flatter me. When I was in the 18th fog zone, I accidentally understood the true meaning of the [True Will of the Sky Dragon] by mistake and managed to transform into the dragon. I was going the wrong direction all along and had nearly disappointed elder,” Ye Qingyu said in a low, ashamed tone.</p>
 <p>“An opportunity is often gained through trial and error,” the mysterious man stated. “But if there is no talent and understanding, one would never reach this step. You are very good.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu thanked him again.</p>
 <p>“In the cemetery of the snow dragon, I had observed your cultivation level, the growth of your inner yuan was obvious. And with the nameless breathing technique, there was no improvements needed, but you do not know the right way of strengthening and refining your body. The constitution of your body is rare, but without effective strengthening and refining you will not reach your full potential. So I taught you the first ancient technique of refining the body, the [True Will of the Sky Dragon], hoping to use the power of the dragon clan to pave the way for you. It is gratifying to see little friend’s progress today.”</p>
 <p>The mysterious person nodded.</p>
 <p>“Elder’s kindness, I am really grateful.” Ye Qingyu finally realized the reason the mysterious person taught him the [True Will of the Sky Dragon].</p>
 <p>From the simple conversation back then, Ye Qingyu was able to feel the compassion and kindness of the mysterious person.</p>
 <p>It was a real compassion for mankind, the image that an outstanding elder of the Human Race should have.</p>
 <p>His care and help to him were like guiding the younger generation of the Human Race.</p>
 <p>“If the Human Race wants to survive in this vast world, it needs more people like you.” The mysterious man sighed. “On your way here, what had happened in the fog and at the foot of the mountain, I have seen it, and i thought it was very good. If not a person of kindness, tremendous courage and wisdom, one cannot set foot on the emperor’s road. To revive the fortune of the Human Race, there must be a new emperor. Only then will there be a glimmer of hope.”</p>
 <p>“Although our Human Race is now declining, but it is still regarded as one of the top ten races in the world. However, elder seems slightly pessimistic, what is the reason behind this...” Ye Qingyu cautiously asked.</p>
 <p>From the words of the mysterious man, it gave the feeling that the Human Race was on the verge of impending catastrophe.</p>
 <p>“In the future, you’ll know...” The mysterious person shook his head. “Since awakening, I had observed the situation everywhere. The situation million of years ago, not only has not been restored, but has worsened. Back then, even the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors could not change the situation, and now the talents of my Human Race is declining, it really is... sigh.”</p>
 <p>As Ye Qingyu listened, he felt heart pounding-apprehension.</p>
 <p>What situation?</p>
 <p>The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors back then were known as invincible, roaming the universe, threatening million of races, and pressuring the other races to the point of being unable to breathe easily. The Human Race was mighty and powerful, what was the situation that not even the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors could resolve?</p>
 <p>“Forget it, these past events, lets not talk about it.” The mysterious man shook his head, his tone becoming relaxed again.</p>
 <p>“Luo So’s palace traveled through space and time and descended here, it is an opportunity. My arrangement before can also be considered as sowing some seeds and sparking fire for the Human Race of the Heaven Wasteland Domain. Luo So this old fool, back then, he liked to leave a number of suspicious palaces everywhere to deceive people. He was harsh and stingy, and the genuinely precious things he possessed, he would never give to other people so easily, so gradually no one played with him anymore. Haha in this false palace, there is no good things, only the deity punishment of thunder and lightning that the old fool obtained from the sea of thunder from the Deity Domain. It is beneficial in strengthening your body, and is also an opportunity.”</p>
 <p>Luo So this old fool?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was so startled that he almost bit off his tongue.</p>
 <p>My heavens.</p>
 <p>Since ancient times, who dares call the [Formation Sovereign] that?</p>
 <p>Could it be that the mysterious man was comparable to the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors back then, or was he an old friend of the [Formation Sovereign] Luo So?</p>
 <p>Although he already knew that the background of the mysterious person was astonishing, but hearing his tone of voice, he was still shocked.</p>
 <p>And from his manner of expression and the fact that he could access the palace of the [Formation Sovereign], it was evident that he is very familiar with this place.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was more and more curious about the background of the mysterious person.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that everything that happened was secretly arranged by you, elder?” Ye Qingyu captured a trace of information from the words of the mysterious man and respectfully asked.</p>
 <p>“That’s not it.” The mysterious person smiled. “I just calculated the place that the moving imperial palace would appear and I heard that you went back in Deer City, so I thought that you may come here and take a look. And it just so happens that in this palace, there is something that I need for me to recover.”</p>
 <p>“Has elder been watching over me?” Ye Qingyu asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“After I left the cemetery of the snow dragon, I traveled all over the world to look for old traces and to observe the new world. I wandered indefinitely, and it just happens to coincide with the opening of this false palace. I followed the traces, passed by Youyan Pass and stayed a few days there. I obviously heard news about you. Then you left the pass and at that time I also arrived at Deer City. When the palace gate opened and dense fog appeared, obviously all sides were alarmed. I thought that you would come here so I came here to provide my assistance.”</p>
 <p>The mysterious man smiled as he explained.</p>
 <p>“I had to trouble elder to guide me, I am incredibly thankful.” Ye Qingyu deeply bowed once again. Ever since the cemetery of the snow dragon, the mysterious person has been concerned about him, like a closely related elder.</p>
 <p>“There’s obviously a reason that I helped you. I hope you would be qualified to become a chess person, and not a chess piece. In the future, I hope you can be like the sages of the past, and continue to guide the Human Race,” the mysterious man said in a hopeful tone, looking at Ye Qingyu with a meaningful glance.</p>
 <p>“I will do my best,” Ye Qingyu said solemnly.</p>
 <p>“What you’ve done, I have heard. You’ve done well.” The mysterious man evidently thought highly of Ye Qingyu. He not only thought highly of Ye Qingyu’s ability, but Ye Qingyu’s style of handling a situation and his nature. Of course, there were perhaps some other reasons.</p>
 <p>“From elder’s words, it seems you are particularly familiar with the palace. Could it be back then...” Ye Qingyu could not help asking after holding himself back several times.</p>
 <p>“Back then, Luo So and I were friends, so I know a little about the old fool,” the mysterious man explained.</p>
 <p>“Just now, elder said that this is a false palace?” In Ye Qingyu’s heart there were countless questions, but facing the mysterious man, he had the feeling of a junior confronting an elder and felt that he should not bombard him with questions. He had to consider which are reasonable questions before carefully putting them forward.</p>
 <p>The mysterious person smiled, and with the flick of his long sleeve, the surroundings lit up. The entire shrine was bright and everything could be seen clearly.</p>
 <p>The scene that Ye Qingyu vaguely saw before was indeed correct.</p>
 <p>The interior of the shrine was much more wide and tremendous than the outside plaza, but was occupied by countless huge ancient stone bookcases, which were crammed with all sorts of books made from different materials. Within each book was a bizarre and majestic power gushing out...</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had never seen such a huge library.</p>
 <p>He was already astonished when he saw the outline before with the help of the light from the lightning, but now that he saw everything clearly he was speechless. The White Deer Academy library, which is known as the largest treasure of books in Deer City, when compared with this shrine, its collection of books was less than that on one bookcase.</p>
