While the essence of the treasures, secret martial arts books of the top sects were kept in the armoury of the [Light Palace]?”</span></p>

Later that War God established the [Light Palace] by himself, and the captured equipment were stored in the [Light Palace]. It is said that many of the eliminated evil sects had books of evil sorcery cultivation techniques, its content is extremely insane and can be called as devoid of human nature. Worried that these books of secret techniques might fall in the hands of those with evil intentions, the War God did not turn these books over to the Imperial family. Instead all these evil cultivation books and treasures were all suppressed beneath the [Light Palace], so that it can never see light again. One hundred years ago, when the War God disappeared, many surviving members of the evil sects wanted to retrieve the rare books, but they did not succeed. They have been hiding in a secret place waiting for the right time. This time the Brute Race and Demon Race have joined together, and came back stronger than before, it seems that they are determined to win.”</span></p>

After all, those evil secret books were also considered the creation of the ancestors of the Human Race. There were rumours that the War God felt that there were no good or evil in martial arts, evil or good is in the heart, so he did not destroy the books. In any case these are all rumours. Later, when the War God disappeared, these evil cultivation books were sealed in the armoury of the [Light Palace].” The one-armed nun sighed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master seems to think highly of the War God,” Bai Yuqing said.</span></p>

I have seen his graceful bearing, that person is indeed unique, absolutely unrivalled, a rare talent of the Human Race. There were many that feared him and many that admired and worshiped him. If you have the chance to see that person, you would most likely fall for his charm.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a brief while, Bai Yuqing asked gain, “Then why did we come here today to watch? To help the [Light Palace] at the critical moment?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one armed nun shook her head. “If the [Light Palace] cannot hold itself, even if master, I, help out, I cannot control the overall situation. We shall silently watch and see how the situation develops. Back then, when the War God fought the sects, there was a sect called Qing Dao Sect that had a rare book called Viewing the Ways of the World Scripture. It can dissolve the trouble of one’s body. Once the [Light Palace] is breached, we will find an opportunity to enter the armoury to find the scripture.”</span></p>

She was not as distant and cold as she was before in White Deer Academy, instead she was like an innocent girl. After all, she was only 18 years old. She said grinning, “Master, you are the famous Divine Buddhist Nun, you’re not here to help your idol?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one armed nun replied indifferently, “Power cannot solve everything, some things cannot be forced, rushing to the fore would only bring disaster.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yuqing stuck out her tongue and said, “This is not what you taught me, you taught me to have a strong sense of justice.”</span></p>

That young man is also a rare genius, it’s a miracle he had come this far, could it be that you like that Lord of the Light Palace?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expression on Bai Yuqing’s face abruptly changed. “Master what are you talking about, that kid was just a nobody when at the academy. The men in this world, hmph, I have no interest in them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“My Qionglai Sect follows the Buddha, but does not prohibit disciples to go into the society, you’re also committed to cultivation. If there is someone that you like, Master will not stop you, you have to think well,” the one-armed nun said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yuqing stubbornly pretended she was perfectly calm, and very bluntly changed the topic. “Why does master know that in the armoury of the [Light Palace], there must be the Viewing the Ways of the World Scripture of the Qing Dao Sect?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How would the one-armed Divine Buddhist Nun not know what this girl was thinking about, but she did not pointed it out and answered, “I have fought with the master of the Qing Dao Sect back then, and have seen the wonder of the Viewing the Ways of the World Scripture. This scripture was originally created by a bodhisattva in the ancient times. It is extremely marvellous, and it was because of this scripture that led to the establishment of Qing Dao Sect. Unfortunately, before the mystery of the scripture had been thoroughly comprehended, I defeated the master of the Qing Dao Sect with the scripture of the west wilderness. Since his cultivation level was not good enough I let him off once, but that person is vengeful and brought all the experts of the Qing Dao Sect to kill me...” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Bai Yuqing said, stomping her feet in anger. “That person is an elder of a faction, and is also considered a master. His status is not low, how could he act so despicably?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The one armed nun smiled faintly. “You have not experienced that era a hundred of years ago, so you do not know how dark the period when sects dominated was. There were many cases of sects being destroyed and families being wiped out due to one wrong sentence. But it was also because I was too careless that I... Didn’t you asked master before why I only have one arm? It was that battle, when the great elder of the Qing Dao Sect chopped it off!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah?” Bai Yuqing was really shocked. “Then...”</span></p>

For me, I felt eternal gratitude to them for saving my life.”&nbsp;</span></p>
