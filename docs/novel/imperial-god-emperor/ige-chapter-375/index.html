 <p>Chapter 375 - Secret Arts of Violet Haze</p>
 <p>[Three Thousand Feet of White Hair] was a secret treasure of the imperial household?</p>
 <p>After reading the scroll that Lang Yong handed to him, Ye Qingyu fell into deep thought.</p>
 <p>That strand of mysterious silver hair was one of the cards that [Painting Saint] Liu Yuqing let Xing’er give to him in Youyan Pass, for him to deal with Li Qiushui, Zhan Shanhe and other people of the Three Sects and Three Schools, and in order to cope with the martial arts meetings. But at that time Ye Qingyu had a sudden martial arts breakthrough and had no use for it. Xing’er also never asked for it back, so it had been with Ye Qingyu all this time.</p>
 <p>In his battle with [Purple Eye] Du Heng, in order to withstand Du Heng’s purple light, Ye Qingyu had to use this piece of precious treasure.</p>
 <p>Moreover, Xing’er had once said that this piece of precious treasure can only be used once and would be exhausted after. This was indeed true. Having withstood against the purple brilliance and defeated [Purple Eye] Du Heng, the strands of silver hair had disappeared.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu originally thought that the white hair belonged to [Painting Saint] Liu Yuqing.</p>
 <p>But in the intelligence provided by Lang Yong, the item [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair] was one of the four secret treasures of the current imperial household of the Snow Empire. It was said that it was a Dao level weapon, the most precious treasure of the empire. It was also said that the Snow Emperor and His Highness Crown Prince are the only ones that are qualify to use this great treasure of the empire.</p>
 <p>This news made Ye Qingyu extremely shocked.</p>
 <p>If this was true, then why would such an important weapon be in Liu Yuqing’s hands?</p>
 <p>And he dared to give such an important object for him to use?</p>
 <p>What was even more unbelievable was that, if [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair] was the most precious treasure of the empire, then it should not be exhausted after one use. An important treasure like that was completely used up in the battle between him and Du Heng; is that not a major loss to the entire Snow Empire?</p>
 <p>Thinking over and over again, Ye Qingyu still felt that the matters do not match up.</p>
 <p>He set down the files and looked to Lang Yong.</p>
 <p>“Does young master think there is something wrong with the information?” Lang Yong was very intelligent, and from the changes in Ye Qingyu’s expression, she was able to capture the change in Ye Qingyu’s psychological activity.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded. “About the information on [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair]... Because the way I obtained it is a little special, I don’t really know much about it...The information stated here is a</p>
 <p>Lang Yong did not immediately answer and instead very carefully thought about it, before she replied assuringly, “Because this matter is closely linked to young master, I personally investigated it myself. I am completely certain that, [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair] is undoubtedly one of the four greatest treasures of the Imperial household of the empire. Also this matter is not extremely confidential, the investigation was very easy.”</p>
 <p>Listening to Lang Yong, Ye Qingyu knew that the information should not be wrong.</p>
 <p>But it was too strange.</p>
 <p>No wonder that from the other information on these files, the major forces of the imperial capital were shocked. This was especially so for many families that were closely related to the Imperial household. Ever since the battle, they had begun to investigate about him, and when he left the military building today, he was immediately being followed...</p>
 <p>The fact that he possessed one of the greatest trerasures of the empire, [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair], even Ye Qingyu himself was extremely shocked, let alone the other major forces of the imperial capital? The impact and significance of this matter had far exceeded the various consequences brought about by him defeating Du Heng. Especially in the current tangled and complicated situation of the imperial capital, most likely, wouldn’t even the Du Household weigh up the gains and losses of this?</p>
 <p>He reckoned that right now, the major forces of the imperial capital would firmly believe that he was someone belonging to the imperial household.</p>
 <p>This misunderstanding was really...</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu knew this was equivalent to yellow mud being smeared on his crotch. No matter whether it was shit or not, he would not be able to explain this.</p>
 <p>But why would Liu Yuqing possess one of the greatest treasures of the empire, [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair]?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was now unclear about the identity of Liu Yuqing.</p>
 <p>Moreover, that little book servant Xing’er was also secretive and mysterious.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu gently shook his head, removing all these distracting thoughts, and began to think about how to cope with the next situation——It was obvious, because of the [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair], the situation of the imperial capital was much more intense than what he had initially imagined, and he would undoubtedly become the center of the vortex.</p>
 <p>And to a great extent, this matter would most likely influence His Majesty Crown Prince’s arrangements for the 18 young experts——Before this incident, if His Majesty Crown Prince wanted to put all these people in some relatively important positions there would not be too much of a hindrance, but after this incident the resistance that the Crown Prince would suffer could be a lot more serious.</p>
 <p>They would be able to find out everything the day after tomorrow.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu finished reading the files in front, remained silent for a moment, and asked, “In the capital, how many people do we have now?”</p>
 <p>“Including myself, we have 113 people.” Lang Yong continued pouring tea for Ye Qingyu, and said confidently without the need to think. “For the real core personnel, there is a total of 23 people, the people that know about young master is me alone.”</p>
 <p>This was the greatest degree of protection for Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>In the future, even when the Two River Gang was being watched, they would never dig up Ye Qingyu——unless Lang Yong was caught. But with Lang Yong’s willpower and loyalty, even facing death she would not do anything that was adverse to Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was of course aware of Lang Yong’s intention.</p>
 <p>But to let such a young girl handle matters, struggle in the light and fight in the dark, and try to cheat or outwit other people, especially in the Imperial capital, such a dangerous place where one careless move could get you killed, was absolutely not what Ye Qingyu wished.</p>
 <p>Not to mention that gangs and factions were not protected by the laws of the imperial capital. Gangs and factions, no matter big and small, were considered as a part of Jianghu, and Jianghu matters should be settled in Jianghu. This was a rule that was applied in the imperial capital. So the death of some of the people of Jianghu, the imperial capital authorities will not look too much into. Even if hundreds of people of a gang was destroyed overnight, the officials would also not investigate.</p>
 <p>The lives of the people of Jianghu, in some cases, are less valuable than the ordinary civilians.</p>
 <p>And for an existence like the division of the Two River Gang, although it was a nobody in the imperial capital, it was still absolutely considered as people of Jianghu. Therefore it could be said that Lang Yong’s situation was also very dangerous, and perhaps one day would suddenly disappear from this world and others would not know where her corpse and bones went...</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was thinking that, to let his 100 people——especially Lang Yong to risk their life to develop the division of the Two Rivers Gang, was he being a bit too selfish? All along, he was used to fighting unaccompanied, and had never really wanted others to serve him.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu also knew that if he told Lang Yong to disband the division and leave the imperial capital, then this for her might be a damage more painful than death.</p>
 <p>His gaze fell upon the beautiful painting-like maiden.</p>
 <p>18 years old, with her cultivation level at the ten Spirit springs. But her cultivation was not considered stable, and she should have received assistance through some special channels, such as medicines and pills to increase her cultivation level, in order to come to the imperial capital. Long Zhong had allocated a lot of resources of the Two Rivers Gang for Lang Yong to enhance her strength.</p>
 <p>“You have undergone a martial arts test before, right?” Ye Qingyu asked.</p>
 <p>“Superior-grade power of understanding, first-class martial arts talent, second grade bones, earth body attributes.” Lang Yong knew what Ye Qingyu wanted to ask her and immediately answered in the first moments.</p>
 <p>“Oh, what weapons do you excel with?”</p>
 <p>“Dagger.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded.</p>
 <p>He casually grabbed a jade piece. With a will of his consciousness, he erased all the information contained within. Then using the power of his spirit and yuan qi, a cultivation technique that originated from the [Fiendgod Tilted Chart], was inserted into the jade piece.</p>
 <p>“There is a part of a cultivation technique inside called… let’s call it Secret Arts of Violet Haze for now. It’s a secret cultivation method that I accidentally obtained from a friend, useful in concealing one’s appearance and to chase down someone. It should be suitable for you so you should practice it. If there are suitable candidates you can also pass it on.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu handed over the jade scroll to Lang Yong.</p>
 <p>Lang Yong was evidently a little surprised. There was a flickering hint of hesitation across the beautiful and serious painting-like face, but soon she obediently received it, and did not check the information in the jade scroll in front of Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu also did not say anything, got up and left the teahouse.</p>
 <p>Given Lang Yong’s superior power of comprehension, he believed that she would understand the profound meaning of the Secrets Arts of Violet Haze without him explaining. The formidable power after comprehending this secret technique was no less than that of the [Heavenly Blind Dao] that Bai Yuanxing received.</p>
 <p>If, in the future, these two people could really cultivate to the peak of these secret cultivation techniques, that is equal to Ye Qingyu cultivating two top level assassins. He believed that within Heaven Wasteland Domain, no one could escape from the assassination of this man and woman.</p>
 <p>Lang Yong accompanied Ye Qingyu to the back courtyard door and turned away. She really did seem like an ordinary tea girl, without even saying too many words.</p>
 <p>They have established a way of contact, and if something else comes up, it would be easy to contact each other.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu came out of the teahouse, let out a brief sigh, and strolled along the South Temple Street for an hour. He arrived at the rune airship station, when he vaguely sensed a familiar aura from behind; it was the two people that he had gotten rid of before.</p>
 <p>Not only them, Ye Qingyu could also sense that, in addition to these two familiar trackers, there were several other very vague auras that had been following him from a little distance away, appearing and disappearing, maintaining a very subtle distance, and clearly also held the same purpose.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu pretended like he did not know and planned to counter the challenge with a calm attitude.</p>
 <p>But just before he came to the hill station, ready to ride an airship, suddenly a mysterious yellow luxury ship whizzed over, abruptly stopping in front of Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>The design of the mysterious ship was simple and unadorned, but unforgettable. The sleek lines, although simple, were beautiful. The most profound often took the simplest form. There was a very rare mithril plating over the entire body of the ship, giving a low-profile yet noble air, like a giant beast. Although there was not any flickering light of formation inscription, the faint heart-palpitating aura flowing around the ship made even Ye Qingyu feel his heart racing the moment his gaze fell upon the mysterious airship.</p>
 <p>In the imperial capital, mysterious yellow is a colour solely used by the imperial household.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu slightly leaned to one side, avoiding the mysterious ship.</p>
 <p>But on the ship came a familiar voice——</p>
