<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Ye Qingyu sighed.</p>
 <p>Was this the brutal fate of these martial artists?</p>
 <p>To be played around by the noble and powerful.</p>
 <p>These martial artists must have been people with talent to be able to cultivate to the fifty or sixty Spirit springs stage. However they were ultimately forced to become flesh puppets, tools for someone to use. They must have been unwilling, but how could they avoid this. Even if they resented this even more, what could this do?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu grew increasingly furious regarding the person controlling everything from behind the scene.</p>
 <p>Therefore when he acted, he no longer showed any mercy.</p>
 <p>"I'll release you all."</p>
 <p>Wit a loud shout, the might of the [Dragon Fist] completely exploded. Everywhere the powerful force of the fist passed, there would be countless black armoured figures exploding and dying.</p>
 <p>The fresh blood from these corpses would turn into a river that flowed from all directions. Such blood was completely ingested cleanly by the tentacles of light manifested by the killing formation.</p>
 <p>After absorbing the blood essence that were like a fountain, the tentacles of light that were all throughout the ground madly began drawing out the killing formation that was not yet completed. It seemed that three quarters of this formation had already been created.</p>
 <p>The black armoured death warriors remained, although their comrades were already piled up like a mountain, there was still not the slightest hint of fear in their eyes. Blood had already completely filled their eyes, that they would fight to their last breaths. They rushed like moths to a flame towards Ye Qingyu. Evidently, they had ingested some sort of medicine that made them lose all reason.</p>
 <p>As the number of black armoured people in the killing formaiton grew less and less, the corpses beneath Ye Qingyu's feet grew more and more. The ground of the killing formation was covered by sticky blood, dyeing it completely red. It seeped into the ground, and even dried up earth transformed into mud!</p>
 <p>After ten of breaths.</p>
 <p>All the black armoured death warriros had died in battle.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's eyes were like lightning as he swept his surroundings.</p>
 <p>"You're still not scramming out, all your dogs have been slaughtered."</p>
 <p>There was a hoarse voice sounding out "tut tut" accompanied by a disdainful laugh. "You are the [War God]. This is only the appetizer. There is still more coming..."</p>
 <p>The voice was faint, and there was no way of determinng the location of the speaker.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu frowned. His brain kept dwelling on this familiar voice, and suddenly a thought surged across his mind. "Could it be young master Du from the Imperial Du household? Such a voice is similar to young master Du a little bit... but it's not exactly the same!"</p>
 <p>There was instantlythe image of young master Du as well as his voice appearing in Ye Qingyu's mind.</p>
 <p>"Similar! Really similar! Just who could he be?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu constantly guessed in his heart, but there was no way to be sure.</p>
 <p>At this time the sinister voice of that person in the darkess amongst the killing formation once again sounded out. It's location was still unable to be determined -----</p>
 <p>"Fine, let's end the appetizer. This is the main course. Hahaha, [War God], enjoy it to your utmost.“</p>
 <p>There was a madness and cruelty wihtin the voice that gave a sensation that it was a wild beast who had lost reason uttering such words.</p>
 <p>Within the black surging mists, there was suddenly a change occurring.</p>
 <p>A series of heavy footsteps sounded, like thunder striking. Everyone's heart lost a beat.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, a muscular and brutish figure was drawn out in the black mist, that ultimately clearly papeared in front of Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>It was a bald man. Just solely from his figure alone, he was taller than Ye Qingyu by at least three heads. He held a blood red huge axe in his hands, and the muscles on his chest were sturdy and exploded out. Clearly, he had terrifying power.</p>
 <p>His gaze regarded Ye Qingyu ferociously. Everytime his eyes met Ye Qingyu, there was a viciousness that would be exposed. The aura surrounding him was extremely tyrannical.</p>
 <p>Within the eyes of this muscular man there was an emotionless light flickering within. It was as if there were two blood pools that were so deep you could not see the bottom. His aura was like a wild beast, and his strength was many time greater than the black armoured death warriors. He was at least a Bitter Sea stage existence.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Ye Qingyu could sense on the body of this muscular man the killing aura that came from a machine.</p>
 <p>He had more life when compared to those black armoured death warriors. But without question, he was also also a form of human puppet tool.</p>
 <p>A Bitter Sea stage expert becoming a flesh puppet formation tool?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was hiddenly surprised in his heart.</p>
 <p>Just what sort of existence had lured him here today?</p>
 <p>Even in the capital, there should not be many people able to bring out so many human flesh formation puppets with such strength.</p>
 <p>The Du household absolutely did not have this ability.</p>
 <p>Could it be the Right Minster?</p>
 <p>Or the Imperial family?</p>
 <p>There was a shadow casted over Ye Qingyu's heart.</p>
 <p>But within his eyes, there was a dense battle will flickering within.</p>
 <p>No matter who it was, since they extended their fangs and claws towards him, then they must make preparations for losing it.</p>
 <p>When he completely eradicated these killing human machines, it would be a question whether that person would still be as patient as to hide in the darkness.</p>
 <p>As such a thought occurred to him, Ye Qingyu could no longer wait. He acted.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The power of the [Dragon Fist] exploded, the flame of his fist like a light pillar.</p>
 <p>Opposite.</p>
 <p>The bald muscular man seemed to have been completely provoked and enraged by Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>There was an extremely vicious killing intent emitting from those terrifying blood pool like eyes. There was strange and evil blood patterns flickering on his body that had unreal muscles, as if they had came alive at this instant. They exploded with a power like the blood sea, the blood axe in the hands causing a mad berserk bloody wind.</p>
 <p>This bloody gust transformed, turning into a hurricane that swirled with great force towards Ye Qingyu!</p>
 <p>Within the hurricane, there were thousands upon thousands of swords moving about. The power of the Bitter Sea stage was demonstrated completely.</p>
 <p>Everywhere this bloody wind passed, the corpses on the ground, stones, rocks, or ancient branches , it all turned into powder!</p>
 <p>Meat paste, crushed rocks as well as fresh blood swept about in the skies in all directions, causing a shocking scene.</p>
 <p>Facing this bloody hurricane, Ye Qingyu did not fear in the slightest. HIs figure did not move, like a bell. When the bloody hurricane was right in front of him, he struck with his fist.</p>
 <p>The roar of dragons.</p>
 <p>"Boom boom!</p>
 <p>With such a powerful strength, there was a clear fist apparent in the air that appeared, the size of half a person. It struck directly against the blood hurricane.</p>
 <p>The powerful currents that contained wind blades, fists spread about everywhere. Like blossoms scattering, it split apart and struck the light barrier, letting off ripple after ripple with Ye Qingyu at the center. Everything tens of meters away from him, corpses, rocks, was completely destroyed by the resounding impact!</p>
 <p>Suddenly!</p>
 <p>Within the bloody hurricane that was scattering, there was a golden glimmer that was shaped like a bloody moon, striking towards Ye Qingyu's head.</p>
 <p>Such a power was like splitting apart a mountain. If he was struck, Ye Qingyu would definitely turn into two pieces.</p>
 <p>"Somewhat interesting!" Ye Qingyu let out a cold snort. His left leg fiercely struck the ground. The next moment, there was a clear gust of wind appearing, and his figure moved, agilely avoiding the bloody axe.</p>
 <p>He stuck probingly with both his fists, a transparent air current forming around his fists. The power of the dragon fists were not in any way less than that of the blood axe of this man.</p>
 <p>With the force of dual fists, he struck to kill towards the head of this muscular man.</p>
 <p>"Ping!</p>
 <p>The powerful force of the blood axe caused there to be a three meter axe scar where Ye Qingyu was originally standing. The glimmer from the axe crushed everything, causing the scar of the axe to last as far as to the ancient buddhist temple tens of meters away.</p>
 <p>But it had not hurt Ye Qingyu in the slightest.</p>
 <p>"Che Che!"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu pressed both his fists together. One left, one right, it was like two dragons had been born that struck at the chest of the muscular man near his left arm.</p>
 <p>But at the crucial moment, a strange change occurred.</p>
 <p>Within the killing formation, there was a dense killing intent that was so chilly that it could freeze one's heart.</p>
 <p>Such a killing intent completey enshrouded Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>The moment he struck with his fists, Ye Qingyu could feel a cold feeling attacking him. His body froze, and there was cold qi everywhere within his body. The power of his dual fists had already shortened by over half.</p>
 <p>But even with the fall in the strength of Ye Qingyu's [Dragon Fist], but was not something the muscular man could block...</p>
 <p>"Kacha!"</p>
 <p>A series of dull muffled sounds of bone cracking emitted from the left arm of the muscular man. He let out a grunt, and his body that was like a steel wall retreated several meters before stabilizing his figure.</p>
 <p>His entire left arm was already in a strange position where it looked snapped.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu frowned, staring at this muscular man. "If not for the killing formation, that punch was enough to instantly take your life."</p>
 <p>The ice yuan qi fluctuated within his body. t that instant, he turned the killing aura that had seeped into his body into nothing.</p>
 <p>Opposite.</p>
 <p>The facial features of that muscular man twisted. Evidently, he felt pain. But as the blood red formation flickered on his body, the broken arm instantly recovered. There was not the slightest of wounds left behind.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was surprised at seeing this.</p>
 <p>"For a Bitter Sea stage expert, their flesh bodies are so strong that they can recover instantly from most wounds. But an injury such as a broken arm, they need at least tens of breaths to recover from. It also expends a lot of yuan qi. For him to instantly heal, it must be something to do with the blood red patterns... This is strange. This human flesh formation tool must not be treated as a normal expert. Unless I destroy the core formations, he is an existence that cannot be destroyed. Thsi is troublesome."</p>
 <p>Within the scattered books in White Deer Academy, Ye Qingyu had once read rumours regarding these battle puppets created using the formation arts.</p>
 <p>But normal formation puppets were made from metal or stone. One had to use extremely high smithing and refining arts before it could be completed. It was extremely difficult, and the materials used were also expensive. Only those true top families of the Empire or perhaps powerful sects could create such a thing.</p>
 <p>Using someone's body as material and creating a flesh puppet formation tool from this was comparatively easy.</p>
 <p>But such a method was incomparably evil and was forbidden under the laws of the Empire.</p>
 <p>But such a restriction was only something to be seen on the surface by normal people. There were many noble families that hiddenly did such an evil thing. At first they used death row prisoners, then they progressed to capturing vagabond cultivators...</p>
 <p>The power of this bald muscular man was at least at the peak of the Spirit spring stage. He had taken half a step into the Bitter Sea stage. When he was further refined into a human flesh puppet formation tool, his strength had further increased and he had taken a step into the Bitter Sea stage.</p>
 <p>Such evil arts, had some strange similarities to that Yan Buhui of the Demon Race who had inserted a demon bone into his own body.</p>
 <p>"But a machine is still a machine. It has the ability to do battle, but lacks true intelligence during battle. Even if his body is indestructible, but it only has brute strength. It cannot create a miracle. But such an opponent is hard to come by. Why don't I use it to try out new martial techniques, especially the newly obtained [Divine Emperor Sword Mantra].”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu slowly formed a plan in his heart---</p>
