 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We discovered this place first," Hu Bugui said, his face darkening. "If you claim that those who stumble upon this treasure also deserve a piece of it, we might consider giving some of it to you but don't you think that you are going too far? Not only did you demand the treasures, but our lives as well?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're not worthy," the young man said with a smirk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We're not worthy?" Hu Bugui laughed coldly. "You must be an idiot then. Without us, you wouldn't have been able to even open these pill furnaces and now you're demanding the pills? Dream on."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui didn't want to openly offend this group of people, since there were so many of them and they all seemed very powerful. If these people were to attack them, he didn't think that he'd be of much help to Ye Qingyu. Little Nine who was supposed to be part of their frontline was now in a deathlike state on Ye Qingyu's shoulder, so Ye Qingyu was now their only hope. He was also worried that if they exchanged blows, the resulting tremors could cause extensive damages to the Immortal pills within the pill furnaces in the palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha, since you two useless beings could open the pill furnaces, why wouldn't I be able to do so myself?" The young man looked at them with a mocking glint in his eye as though he was cruelly toying with a rat. "My patience is running out. I guess both of you will not be convinced unless I take drastic measures. You must not want to die a quick death..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he finished speaking—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A cold smile appeared on Ye Qingyu's face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're too noisy... My patience has run out a long time ago."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, a red glow appeared in his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It swirled with divine splendor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Piercing sword will filled the Void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone felt a chill run down their spines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Protect the pill furnaces." He shot Hu Bugui a look before he attacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu Bugui chanted an ancient incantation and the emperor qi tile appeared. Misty green light spilled from the tile and its ancient and mysterious aura spread everywhere like silk strips to envelop the pill furnaces within the Bagua Formation. His emperor qi tile was a broken one, so it didn't have any attacking abilities but its defenses were impenetrable. Obviously, a large amount of yuan qi was needed to activate this tile; given Hu Bugui's current cultivation and the large area this green glow was covering, he wouldn't be able to last very long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Ye Qingyu had to end the battle as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He immediately summoned the [Blood Drinker Sword Pill].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At his mental command, ten thousand swords appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [Blood Drinker Sword Pill] was guided by his will and transformed into ten thousand rays of blood red sword formations, which contained countless rays of Divine Emperor sword will. Then, these formations shot out like a comet from his palm, as if ten thousand shooting stars were racing through the skies, as they all headed toward the handsome young man and his cronies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hm? How dare you attack me!" The handsome young man's face immediately darkened. "You must be tired of living... Come on, capture him alive. I'm going to torture him until he begs for mercy."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The handsome young man retreated slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The experts by his side immediately stepped forward and attacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These experts were all Saints; the moment they attacked, the skies were filled with intermingling Saint markings, evolving from the power of laws as the dense yuan qi formations transformed into knives, swords, jade plates, gourds, axes, shuttles, mountains, rivers and many other things that charged at Ye Qingyu from the surrounding area. These Saint experts had a wealth of combat experience. They were silent and vicious, with their attacks practically in sync. It was clear that they were experienced troops and they were as disciplined as the army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was also shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this shock only lasted a brief moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Saint transformations and the sword will from his [Blood Drinker Sword Pill] collided madly against each other, releasing a series of metallic clangs. Thousands of rays of crimson light immediately retracted upon impact as though they were alive to return to Ye Qingyu's hands. The light gathered to form a big and heavy blood-colored sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"[Sword Tempest]!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the sword was in his hand, he quickly exerted the [Sixth Limit] of the [Limitless Divine Way].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His current physical cultivation was comparable to a Great Saint and was almost at the peak of perfection, so activating the [Limitless Divine Way] didn't require much effort at all. The divine splendor from his body surged and its light beams were like rainbows. He used his mysterious technique, the [Void Walking] technique to instantly appear like a ghost in front of the two Saint realm experts at the very front of the pack. He waved his [Blood Drinker Sword] and its [Sword Tempest] roared forth wildly. In a flash of crimson light, two heads were sent flying into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those two Saints were killed before they could even react.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strange markings on the [Blood Drinker Sword] flashed as the boundless [Sword Tempest] swept through their corpses; their blood qi, yuan essence and all of their energies were instantly extracted and absorbed into the sword. Those two corpses immediately looked like dried up sand statues and started to disintegrate, then disappeared into the Void like burning embers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The handsome young man was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn't even manage to sense how Ye Qingyu had attacked earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had managed to kill two Saints with one stroke of his sword, destroying both their physical bodies as well as their spirits. He was indeed a little terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If a Saint's body was destroyed under normal circumstances, he had the ability to reconstruct it. This was why it was very difficult for a Saint to kill a fellow Saint on the same level. Only a Great Saint or a Quasi-emperor would have the ability to instantly kill Saints by drawing on the power of laws. However, everyone could tell that Ye Qingyu was only at the lower Saint realm, so how did he manage to achieve such a feat?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What's going on?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the handsome young man could even analyze the situation further, Ye Qingyu was already charging toward him at maximum speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Protect the young lord!" The remaining Saints were all shocked and angered at the deaths of their comrades and the failure of their attacks. They unleashed their magical abilities that were hurtled toward Ye Qingyu like lightning. Four of them stood in front of the handsome young man while the remaining Saints joined forces to launch another attack on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled coldly and he swept his [Blood Drinker Sword] in a circular arc.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He continued to use the [Sword Tempest].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The joint attacks of the dozens of Saints were instantly destroyed by the boundless red sword radiance, as quick as cutting through tofu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One sword could destroy everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He used his mysterious technique, the [Void Walking] technique, once again to easily extract himself from the dozens of Saints who encircled him and arrived in front of the handsome young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mocking smile spread across his face and he slashed out with his [Blood Drinker Sword]. He continued to use the [Sword Tempest], activating the third move from the [Four Moves of the Unmatched General] with his Divine Emperor sword will to unleash incredible power. Furthermore, he was still in the state of the [Sixth Limit] of the [Limitless Divine Way], so his combat strength was unbelievably strong. The four Saints protecting the handsome young man were instantly killed like mantises trying to stop a chariot. All their blood qi and life energies were absorbed by the [Blood Drinker Sword] and their bodies transformed into grey ash that disappeared into the Void as if they had been reduced to ashes after a fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's attack was unstoppable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These Saints were like defenseless animals in front of Ye Qingyu and were slaughtered mercilessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone, including Hu Bugui, was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Damn it!" the handsome young man bellowed. A powerful force burst forth from his body, knocking aside several Saints who were protecting him. "All of you are embarrassing me. I'll face him myself... [Wandering Dragon Cloud Sucking Spear], come out!" He reached into the Void with a flip of his hand and a long spear that took on the shape of a golden wandering dragon appeared in his hand. The carving of the wandering dragon climbed all over the spear’s body; its shaft appeared from the mouth of the golden dragon. Three feet of translucent jade green-colored spear radiance spewed from its mouth that seemed to solidify. It breathed out this spear radiance in spurts and this radiance contained destructive Chaos killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a divine spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was rather surprised. This was probably what made that young man so arrogant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The divine spear in his hand and his peak Saint yuan qi cultivation meant that he was probably as powerful as the Four Stars holy girl or the Third Prince of the Mizar Race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Are you really going to show off your spear skills in front of me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back when Ye Qingyu was still at White Deer Academy, he was known for his spear skills. The first combat technique he managed to learn in the [Fiendgod Titled Chart] was the [Four Moves of the Golden Armored King]. It was the most powerful spear technique and was derived from the essence of tens and thousands of basic spear techniques in the world. Although he had mainly switched over to sword techniques, he didn't neglect his spear skills. There was also a technique known as the [Four Moves of Cold Rays] in the [Fiendgod Titled Chart] that was also a spear technique. He had also learned that technique so his spear skills could be considered the best amongst the younger generation of martial artists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The handsome young man attacked and his spear force was like a raging dragon. He had clearly cultivated a divine spear combat technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His cultivation and combat techniques combined with this divine spear were truly extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This even affected the green rays from Hu Bugui's emperor qi tile which rippled slightly, shaken by the handsome young man's powerful force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An ordinary Saint wouldn't have been able to survive when confronted with such formidable spear skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, his opponent was Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only that, he had encountered a Ye Qingyu who wanted the battle to end as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"[Soul Stealing Heaven Strike]!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He held the [Blood Drinker Sword] with both hands and its crimson flames flashed from his palm and the hilt of his sword. He moved so quickly that only his shadow could be seen, immediately figuring out the weak point of that man's spear technique. He moved forward and broke past the man's spear force. Then, he raised his sword and slashed it down with a force that could cut the heavens open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The handsome young man switched moves and turned his long spear horizontally to block the move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ding!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sparks flew everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an explosion of terrifying power and the force hit the handsome young man so hard that a blood arrow spurted from his mouth. His eyes were filled with astonishment for he was unable to figure out how a lower Saint like Ye Qingyu could muster up such terrifying strength. He suddenly felt dread creep into his heart. However, before he could even react, he suddenly felt his inner yuan stop and his entire cultivation seemed to be suppressed, which caused the pent-up spear force to break apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A ray of red sword light flashed past his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No...!" he cried out for the last time before his throat was slashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next moment, he saw a vast blood-colored divine splendor as it was being extracted from his body and absorbed into the [Blood Drinker Sword].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The handsome young man's body became a dried up corpse that remained standing on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [Blood Drinker Sword] buzzed and vibrated after it swallowed the blood-colored divine splendor from that handsome young man's body. It reacted like a tipsy burly man who had drunk his fill and continued to vibrate unceasingly. It then released a satisfied sword cry that echoed throughout the main hall and its mysterious blood-colored ancient formation markings lit up, releasing a mist that swirled around its sword body. It looked extremely peculiar, as though it was either undergoing a strange transformation or it was digesting something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silence fell upon the entire area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining twenty or so Saints were completely dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could that be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How did their young lord die by a single blow?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Uh... all hell was about to break loose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Did... did you know who you've just killed?" One of the Saints looked at Ye Qingyu as though he was looking at a dead man walking. He lost his composure and screamed wildly. "You... you're definitely doomed and so will every single person who knows you. The domain you belong to will be completely destroyed!"</span></p>
