Furthermore, the ice sword mirage activated by the [Human King Sword Mantra] could also change form between real and incorporeal, Ye Qingyu was at a state where even deities and ghosts could not guess at.</span></p>

But he did not realize that apart from the injuries, the power of ice had already slowly entered into his body. This was especially so because the power of the [Supreme Ice Flame] was hidden within. After it had accumulated to a certain extent, as soon as it was activated by Ye Qingyu, it was enough to completely freeze his body.</span></p>

Li Qiushiu had fallen into the wrong path, and he himself, as a Patriarch, would have launched a sneak attack.

The tip of the sword was an oval, its arc graceful and elegant, like limpid autumn water running through a mountain stream, bright and beautiful without the slightest of imperfections. It was evidently made from high class materials, and was absolutely made from a formation smith at the grandmaster level. The handle of the sword was in the shape of a purple star, it's hilt the size of a little child’s arm. The lines were clearly defined, with a faint cold will spreading about, which could increase the resistance and made holding the sword even more stable. &nbsp;</span></p>

No matter whether it was his weapon or his cultivation, it was better compared to Ye Qingyu.

Compared to the [Little Shang] sword and the [Beheading Wind] sword, the yuan channels were much better. All his previous weapons had no way of withstanding Ye Qingyu's full power inserting into them. Once the yuan qi inserted into them was too vast, the body of the swords would instantly collapse.</span></p>
