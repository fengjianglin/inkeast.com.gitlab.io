Wen Wan hesitated, then continued, "It's said that his talent is practically heaven-defying and he is the most outstanding talent that emerged from the Dragon-Human clan in close to six thousand &nbsp;years. The blood that flows within his veins is the purest Dragon Race blood that has been seen in the past thousands of centuries. He reached the Peak Great Saint Realm five thousand &nbsp;years ago and is said to be as powerful as the peerless Dragon-Human clan experts who perished in the 18th district thousands of centuries ago. There is also a rumor that he is the legitimate son of the Dragon-Human clan's ancestor."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ximen Yeshui grew more excited and his eyes flashed. He continued, "It is also rumored that three thousand years ago, this retired emperor overthrew one hundred thirty-six sects single-handedly, of which fifty-eight sects were medium forces, ten were top forces, and two were super forces. In a single night, he slaughtered close to a hundred Saints and a Great Saint... Tsk, tsk, tsk. He is definitely a vicious and cruel character. To be honest, his combat strength sounds terrifying and I'm afraid that my master might only be fit to carry his sandals. Haha..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ximen Yeshui was probably the only person throughout the myriad domains who dared to speak of his master in such a manner behind his back.</span></p>

He looked at Wen Wan and said, "Since he seems like such a formidable character and is almost invincible, why hasn't the Dragon-Human clan regained their former glory after all these years?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to his research, the Dragon-Human clan was one of the most ancient races of the myriad domains. With their long history and vast amounts of resources, they were once the indisputable overlords of the myriad domains in their glory days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, thousands of centuries ago, their ancestor perished and their [Dragon Blood Halberd] was lost in the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss. Left without a leader, the Dragon-Human clan naturally started to decline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over time, as other races started to grow stronger, the Dragon-Human clan gradually started to decline and maintained a low profile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Now that you mention it... with the exception of the retired emperor, the rest of the Dragon-Human clan is very ordinary. As the saying goes, each one is worse than the last. It would be extremely rare for the later generations to produce a genius. One tree does not make up a forest and it would be impossible for the retired emperor alone to salvage the situation. He has given his all these past few years to the Dragonblood Dynasty, and a sage once surmised that if this retired emperor had not been distracted by his temporal and worldly desires and devoted too much energy to the Dragonblood Dynasty, he might have already stepped on the emperor's road by this time." Wen Wan heaved a soft sigh, then looked at Ye Qingyu. He looked as though he was about to speak, but ultimately swallowed his words, seeming slightly emotional.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, one could not help but feel for an expert who was almost at the pinnacle of the martial way whose progress on the martial way had been halted because of the ties to his race and was now unable to make further breakthroughs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu was slightly shaken by Wen Wan's words, for he understood the look in Wen Wan's eyes and also understood what he meant by that sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu's own predicament was extremely similar to that of the retired emperor of the Dragon-Human clan. In the same way that this demon-like talent of the Dragon-Human clan had to support the entire Dragonblood Dynasty, Ye Qingyu himself now had to support the entire Heaven Wasteland Dynasty. To be more precise, the sudden rise of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps on the Road of Chaos was because of the single-handed efforts of Ye Qingyu. With the exception of Ye Qingyu, few amongst the Heaven Wasteland Domain could be considered experts. Even a talent such as Yan Buhui, who was highly regarded in the Heaven Wasteland Domain, would not amount to much here in the Vast Thousand Domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the talents of the Heaven Wasteland Domain were unable to mature fast enough to share Ye Qingyu's burden, as time passed, Ye Qingyu would probably also have to devote his energies to the matters of the Heaven Wasteland Domain. This would definitely hinder his progress on the martial way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu could not say anything to relieve Wen Wan's worries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he was entrenched so deeply within the Heaven Wasteland Domain, he could no longer break free.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One would have to compromise in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"No matter what happens, there is no need to concern yourselves with this matter of the Dragonblood Dynasty," Ye Qingyu said resolutely. He did not reveal much but instead, changed the topic. "We will need to closely monitor what others are saying in Heaven Connect City. Pay close attention to who makes the most vicious accusations and report their names to me. I'd like to see who is aiding the Black Moon Immortal Palace in an attempt to bring us down."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The murderous spirit was clear in his message.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu's words put everyone's minds at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one was sure when it had started, but everyone within the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps had already placed blind faith and trust in Ye Qingyu. Regardless of how serious the situation might seem, as long as Ye Qingyu said that there was no problem, it was as though everything would truly be alright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, everyone started to relax and feel more reassured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They talked for another two hours and finally dispersed after the Empress assigned tasks to all of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu returned to the quiet room to continue his self-isolation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to the news that Wen Wan and the others had brought back, the situation in the foreign domain, as well as the ultimate expert of the Dragon-Human clan who was on his way here, things were not looking good for the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps. Ye Qingyu was still confident but he did not dare to let down his guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, he had to make full use of the time he had to regain his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu spent the next few days immersed in cultivating. When he was not cultivating, he went to the western yard to check on the injured members of the diplomatic corps and see how they were recuperating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time flew by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three to five days went by in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he had subdued those doctors of Heaven Connect City with his thunderous methods the last time, the injured were recovering at a much faster pace and he no longer had to spend vast amounts of resources and money. Wang Zhen also had the other doctors firmly under his thumb. Furthermore, after hungrily absorbing the medical theories and medical way of the Vast Thousand Domains, his vast knowledge enabled him to comprehend new things through analogies. He proposed many alchemical techniques and prescriptions that had dumbfounded the so-called doctors of Heaven Connect City. In a few days, Wang Zhen had fully unveiled his extraordinary talent and skills in the medical way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Awed by Wang Zhen's talent, the eminent doctors of Heaven Connect City had fully submitted to him and were very cooperative. They had even consulted with Wang Zhen on several issues and engaged him in their discussions. Although they had initially submitted to Ye Qingyu due to fear, their attitudes had changed because of their respect and awe for Wang Zhen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as martial artists continually aimed for progress along the martial way, every doctor would naturally pursue and long for progress along the medical way. These eminent doctors of Heaven Connect City had only committed evil deeds and joined the scamming gang of Heaven Connect City because they were no longer able to progress due to their statuses and lack of resources. Now that they had found hope again, they turned over a new leaf to wholeheartedly pursue their medical studies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Wang Zhen was from the Heaven Wasteland Domain, he was not influenced nor bound by the schools of medical thoughts of the Vast Thousand Domains, so his methods tended to be unorthodox. But if one paid closer attention and verified his methods, one would realize that there was sound logic behind them. The clashing and merging of the different medical ways of the Heaven Wasteland Domain and Vast Thousand Domains caused Wang Zhen's medical skills and knowledge to increase rapidly. Similarly, the few eminent doctors of Heaven Connect City felt as though a gate to a whole new world of knowledge lay before them and started to delve crazily into it.</span></p>

As he gradually regained his yuan qi, Ye Qingyu would inject a wisp of yuan qi, which contained traces of yellow Immortal qi, into Great Dragon Turtle Demon's body each day. Through trial and error, Ye Qingyu had discovered that the yellow divine qi seemed to complement the medicinal effects of the Violet-Gold Dragon King Ginseng. This was even more beneficial to Great Dragon Turtle Demon's body.</span></p>

Back then, Ye Qingyu had obtained his knowledge of elixir refinery from these formations and had stunned the Pill God and Medicine God of the empire with his knowledge. This meant that the one hundred and eight ancient characters contained the mysteries of the medical way.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first sect to call on them was a sect led by the Human Race, known as the Shunchang Sect. They were not as big as the super forces in the myriad domains but they were rather well-respected amongst the emerging sects over the past thousand years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had come to visit as a gesture of goodwill.</span></p>

They were clearly abiding by the principle of "An enemy of an enemy is a friend" when they came to visit and hoped that they could be considered allies with the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps.</span></p>

This news quickly spread like wildfire across Heaven Connect City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they had only had a glimpse of the gracefulness and hospitality of the Empress, it answered many of their questions. The sects who had been quietly observing the situation and lived in fear of Ye Qingyu's terrifying reputation as a crazed killing god suddenly realized that the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps was not an exclusive and ignorant sect. The hospitality and grace extended to the Shunchang Sect showed that they were willing to cooperate and interact with the various races and forces across the Vast Thousand Domains.</span></p>

Other than wanting to catch a glimpse of Ye Qingyu, they also wanted to express their views on cooperation with the Heaven Wasteland Domain. They showed due respect to the diplomatic corps and were sincere in their intentions.</span></p>

In the name of visiting a new domain, they came to deliver some kind of message or attempted to try to suss out if Ye Qingyu truly possessed precious treasures. They intended to use their visit to find fault with the Heaven Wasteland Domain, or deliver a message on behalf of the Black Moon Immortal Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Green Xuan Hall became unusually lively.</span></p>

It suddenly became trendy in Heaven Connect City for anyone, regardless of race or status, to call on the Green Xuan Hall. The experts from the major races and forces almost destroyed the threshold to the Green Xuan Hall in their rush to visit that place. Those who were not aware of the situation could not have been faulted for assuming that there was a grand gathering taking place in the hall.</span></p>

Regardless of how prominent their force was or their motives for visiting, they were all received by Empress Yu Xiaoxing and several members of the diplomatic corps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Empress Yu Xiaoxing displayed the gracefulness that befitted her rank as the Empress of the Human Race. She was always dignified throughout, and this caused many forces to understand that the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps was not just about that crazy punk Ye Qingyu but that it was also led by an incredibly gorgeous Empress. This was a good sign, for Yu Xiaoxing had displayed her talent and charm to the world, which greatly improved the image that everyone had of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps. The perceptions that these foreign domains had about the Heaven Wasteland Domain started to become more fair and comprehensive. Positive stories and hearsay about the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps started to make their rounds around Heaven Connect City.</span></p>

This afternoon, a force known as the Heavenly Mandate Gate wanted to call on you. They mentioned that they have been suppressed by the Black Moon Immortal Palace for many years and want to join forces with the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps to expose their evil deeds. Also, an Enforcement Elder of the Crimson Divine Sect brought an entourage of more than a dozen disciples to the Green Xuan Hall and said that they would like to inquire about their ancestor…"</span></p>

This was something that Empress Yu Xiaoxing had specially tasked him to do. It did not take a lot of time or effort but was a clever way of keeping Ye Qingyu abreast of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps' current situation and others' perception of them.</span></p>

They will finally be announcing the results of the test… You were in self-isolation so the Empress did not send anyone to inform you at once."</span></p>

Ye Qingyu was surprised. This was sooner than he had imagined. He thought for a moment, then asked, "Did Elder Yan mention anything else?"</span></p>

As for the rest of the diplomatic corps, they will have to patiently wait at the Green Xuan Hall for the results. The Empress also asked about the final outcome, but Elder Yan was not aware of the outcome either." Luo Yi briefly summarized everything that Yan Wushuang had said.</span></p>
