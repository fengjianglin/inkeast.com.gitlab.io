 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smile appeared on the sect master's face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha ha, this is the Four Stars Sect. We are a great sect with more than ten thousand years of history behind us, so we have huge amounts of resources and assets at our disposal. We will not be brought down even by the greatest of controversies," he said with a smile and looked condescendingly at Spokesperson Li as though the winner had already been decided. "I'm afraid that you'll be disappointed by the outcome of this battle. Don't worry, I swear that your only daughter won't suffer after your death. Instead, I'll make sure that she'll live well," he specifically placed an emphasis on the words 'live well', as though there was a sly innuendo in his word. He tried to use this to dent Spokesperson Li's confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sect master knew that Spokesperson Li had gone into seclusion because he had been traumatized after the death of his beloved wife and went off the grid with his only daughter. Today, his daughter was his only weakness and now that the Four Stars Sect had an absolute advantage, the sect master started to formulate alternative plans. He wanted to force Spokesperson Li to turn against the Human Race headquarters and join forces with him to attack Ye Qingyu. This would be a huge blow to Ye Qingyu both mentally and physically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To his surprise, Spokesperson Li merely smiled and his eyes were bright and clear as though he had weathered through all the vicissitudes of life. "Our life and death have already been preordained and the heavens will decide who will emerge victorious today. As the sect master of Four Stars Sect, I'm shocked that you would sink to such methods to threaten me. It is definitely no coincidence that the Four Stars Sect has fallen to such depths today. Don't you feel ashamed listening to yourself?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Embarrassment flashed past the sect master's face. Then, he quickly shook his head and smiled, "The end justifies our means. What is the point in having so much to say when you're already destined to die today?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, his gaze fell on Ye Qingyu and he smirked, "Kid, you have interfered in our affairs far too many times and you deserve death. Our Quasi-emperor has yet to make his appearance but you've already shown all your cards, so you're destined to lose today. If you surrender to the Four Stars Sect and agree to submit to our command, we might spare you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu didn't even look at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His gaze never left the elderly Quasi-emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He completely ignored the sect master's words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You… ha ha. Very well," The sect master was enraged by his haughty demeanor that bordered on being an insult. His eyes flashed menacingly and due to the martial arts techniques he cultivated, his aura turned violent and sinister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Holy Girl laughed and glanced at Ye Qingyu as she said, "Don't tell me that you're placing all your hopes on this old man. He can't even save himself now… Brother Ye Qingyu, a wise man would submit to his circumstances, so why must you…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before she could finish her sentence—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu finally looked at the Four Stars Sect's camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"None of you have the right to speak to me," he said, enunciating each word clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His demeanour was calm and composed and did not look like he was deliberately trying to be arrogant. Instead, he spoke as though he was naturally looking down on them all and disdain dripped from his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How arrogant of you!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sect master and the Four Stars Holy Girl both sputtered with rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He must be courting death."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That bastard, he's just a lowly peasant from a lower domain."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha, I bet he must be extremely frightened right now… and is deliberately putting on an act."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Our Quasi-emperor should make an appearance now and capture him alive. Then, we should make him experience hell by putting him through all one thousand and one methods of torture at our sect."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The disciples of the Four Stars Sect in their camp were enraged and yelled loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sect master shook his head and looked at Ye Qingyu as though he was looking at a dead man. He did not attempt to make any further small talk, but turned to face the crowd and said loudly, "Everyone, as you can tell, it is clear who will emerge victorious today. Since you’ve come to watch the spectacle, why don't you show yourselves and tell us which side you will take? Will you stand with us or will you support this madman Ye Qingyu…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was forcing the experts from the various forces to make their stand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha ha, if you make the wrong choice today, don't blame us for being ruthless after we're done killing Ye Qingyu and his allies," Kong Wuyu who was one of the Seven Sons chimed in loudly. "Join us and you shall prosper, defy us and you shall die."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roar! Roar! Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thousands of elite disciples of the Four Stars Sect roared in unison as they drew their swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their show of strength was very menacing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was extremely difficult for the experts of the various forces to try and back out of this situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many who even regretted their decision to come to watch the spectacle today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several experts reluctantly bowed their heads and inched toward the Four Stars Sect’s camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's side was completely deserted and not a single force nor expert dared to approach them. Everyone kept a safe distance away from them as though they were carriers of a contagious plague. No one wanted to be associated with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha ha ha ha…" The sect master threw his head back and laughed loudly at this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He slowly walked out of the divine temple and stood high in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Show yourself, the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect. I know that you're here and I challenge you to a battle today. Let's put an end to our grudges," Ye Qingyu spoke and his words seemed to carry a mysterious power of laws that pervaded the air, causing ripples to spread throughout the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, there was no response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect did not appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ah ha ha ha, our sect's Quasi-emperor is such a venerable person that he will not let himself be challenged by someone as cocky as yourself…" The sect master chuckled loudly and looked at Ye Qingyu with derision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many disciples of the Four Stars Sect also laughed incredulously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless pairs of eyes look at him with pity, contempt, derision, disdain, sympathy and various other emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu remained unruffled and opened his mouth to speak once more, "Ha ha, as a Quasi-emperor you betrayed your own kind, then you fled like a defeated dog after you were defeated by [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] at the space battle of Capital Sky Peak. Do you lack the courage to even appear before me today?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before his voice had died down—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How dare you speak so impudently?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An authoritative voice boomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, it was immediately followed by a terrifyingly oppressive power and a huge divine palm tore through the void and slammed down toward Ye Qingyu as though it was smacking a fly. Almost half the void was shattered by the force of this palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was provoked and attacked in his anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's words had pricked at the greatest insult and embarrassment of his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha ha ha ha!" Ye Qingyu laughed loudly. His figure was shrouded by the massive force of the huge palm and he looked like a stalk of grass in the eye of the storm and could be crushed dead at any moment but then, the [Cloud Top Cauldron] suddenly made its appearance and immediately transformed into a huge cauldron that was several thousand meters high. Matchless bright yellow Immortal qi circulated around it and formed a protective cover around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a huge clash of Dao sound and the power of laws sparked everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The huge cauldron shook violently but remained erect and unshakable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was perfectly unharmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What's wrong? Has your embarrassment turned into anger because my words hit a sore spot?" he asked as he stood in the void, his black hair dancing in the wind. He was like a fiendgod and he exuded such a righteous aura that one could not stare at him in the face and carried himself with such elegance that was impossible to put into words. Then, he continued, "You did all these things despite knowing how shameful it was, so why are you afraid of others mentioning this incident?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you want to court death this much, I'll grant your wish."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A figure appeared in the void. This was a middle-aged man with average features who was dressed in ordinary brown robes, but despite his ordinary appearance, he carried himself with the authority of a king as he emerged from the void – this was the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he appeared, it was as though the entire universe breathed in unison with him and he captured everyone's attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A series of cheers rose from the Four Stars Sect's camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless disciples of the Four Stars Sect looked at him with fervent reverence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperors were considered invincible in the absence of a true Martial Emperor, so this middle-aged man in brown robes was revered by the Four Stars Sect as a god.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Holy Girl and the sect master both looked at him with respect as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was the only one who looked at this man as though he was looking at a wicked criminal. Their eyes met, then he smirked, "Unfortunately, I don't think you'll be able to kill me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do you really think that this cauldron would be able to protect you?" the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect said and his eyes hardened coldly. "It is merely a divine weapon being wielded by an ant and this is like casting pearls before swine – you will not be able to bring out its fullest potential."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, really?" Ye Qingyu retorted. "I wonder if you've recovered from the injuries you sustained during the previous battle and how much strength do you have left in you to battle it out today?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He especially detested this Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, his loathing of this Quasi-emperor was even more intense than his loathing of Quasi-emperor Mushan, Wei Wubing, the ancient Dragon Emperor, and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a Quasi-emperor of the Human Race, he was strong enough to stem the powers of darkness to become the hero of mankind and could defend his race from the attacks of darkness, yet he had turned his back on everything that was important for his own selfish gains. Why did the heavens allow such a man to even become a Quasi-emperor in the first place?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who were blessed with talent and strength but chose to head down the evil path were more detestable than the ordinary people who committed evil crimes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Injuries? Do you think that an ant like yourself will be able to understand the might of a Quasi-emperor?" The Quasi-emperor asked and he clearly found Ye Qingyu equally detestable. He said in annoyance, "Let's cut the crap. I'll send you to your death right now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he raised his hand and punched out in Ye Qingyu's direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All martial arts moves and mysterious techniques were useless to a Quasi-emperor and everything would revert to its original simplicity. Any simple move or technique that a Quasi-emperor made contained a power that surpassed all divine skills and mysterious techniques. The moment he sent this punch out, the void immediately twisted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a Quasi-emperor who had thrown all his might behind that attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He punched out with an earth-shattering power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone present at the battlefield could feel the terrifying force from the remnant energy waves circulating all around them and hastily retreated. These waves were so strong that they felt as though they were on the brink of death, so they could imagine what kind of unbelievable pressure Ye Qingyu was facing as he bore the brunt of that attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect showed his clear intent to kill through this move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This was what I was about to say too," Ye Qingyu's eyes shone brightly with divine splendor and he exerted all his techniques to their limits and instantly attained the [Ninth Limit] which was also the most powerful level of the [Limitless Divine Way].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had only spoken so much earlier because he was adjusting his condition to reach this level of the [Limitless Divine Way].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Die!" Ye Qingyu roared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He used both hands to produce a simple handprint, then he opened his mouth to spit out a Geng Metal Pill. This pill reacted to the handprint and immediately split open. Then, a pair of dazzling flying swords that were forged in the shape of wings charged forward, instantly ripping the skies apart as easily as cutting through butter. It promptly slashed apart the Quasi-emperor's power of laws from his fist will with a hissing sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the Four Stars Quasi-emperor could react, the pair of flying swords ripped apart the protective force field around him and circled around his neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, his head fell from his body like a ripe fruit falling from a tree.&nbsp;</span></p>
