To think a thing of such lowly moral quality like you would dare to bark over here." He looked at Yang Wanqu with an undisguised contempt as if looking at a dog, "It's such a disgrace to the Black Moon Divine Palace to have produced a nincompoop like you. You and Lu Li are cut from the same cloth and aren't anything good... Oh, I nearly forgot, this madwoman talked about taking in slaves, perhaps that suits a dogface like you, or maybe, you've already become one having been following behind her. A slave should be clear about his status. Do you really think you have a place to talk here?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Wanqu fumed upon hearing this.</span></p>

And though it was only because he had no choice that he became a slave, this matter was nevertheless a sore spot which he was unwilling to talk about. However, the consolation for him was that he obtained huge benefits by recognizing such a peerless demon-like talent as the Four Stars holy girl as his master. If his plan succeeded, his status would rise directly into the clouds and he would become even more prominent than the master of his sect, and thus he would have profited overall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was on the verge of exploding having been embarrassed so badly by Ye Qingyu.</span></p>

He would certainly have attacked earlier on if the holy girl was not present and he did not have to seek permission as her slave before taking action.</span></p>

He was holding a crescent-shaped machete which was throbbing with captivating moonlight that multiplied in amount over time until the moon itself seemed to have descended and enveloped all of the vital parts on Ye Qingyu's body.</span></p>

Yang Wanqu was deeply shocked. He had used his newly-gained power to execute the battle skill of the Black Moon Divine Palace and did not hold anything back, all so that he could display his worth to his mistress. However, he did not expect his opponent to so easily catch hold of it and issue bursts of feedback force that nearly caused him to lose grip of his machete, and was thereby both shocked and enraged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu shook his head gently.</span></p>

This was not the result he had been hoping for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle continued.</span></p>

"Little Yu, that person is stalling for time, and we can't wait any longer... Actually, you should've seen from the get-go that Yang Wanqu isn't that person's match, so why let him fight?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A meek laugh was heard from beneath the holy girl's veil. "Elder Brother Yin, your thoughts are always so simple. Yang Wanqu's talents are limited but his aspirations are high. Although he was forced by circumstance to become my pet, he's feeling upbeat having acquired the power of the evil ancestors, and thus it'll do him good to spar with this person as long as he doesn't die... By the way, have you discerned the discipleship and origin of this person?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only person who could address the Four Stars holy girl as Little Yu and talk to her in this kind of tone was the Mizar Race's Third Prince himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, the Four Stars holy girl's voice was only so gentle, amiable, and chirpy while talking to this prince. To anyone else, be it her teachers or elders, she always spoke frostily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prince shook his head, saying, "Strange, I can't tell. The depths of this person's strength cannot be seen clearly. Although his cultivation seems meager, there is a terrifying power lying dormant in his body. Plus, his manipulation of the power of thunder and lightning is astounding. I've never seen this kind formation handprint technique before, and read in the legends that only His Highness the Formation Emperor Luoso possessed it. Could it be that..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Are you saying that he could be a successor of His Highness the Formation Emperor Luoso?" There was a piercing chill in the holy girl's voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The prince nodded at first but then shook his head, saying, "That's possible... but no matter who he is, I'll get rid of him as long as he blocks your way. Plus, it's not a certainty that he's truly a successor of Luoso, and even so, so what? I'd fight for you even if Luoso personally comes."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This burly young man in golden armor spoke in a tone containing a heart-palpitating battle intent that burned and surged frenziedly, like an invincible demon war god whose virility was sky-high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hee hee, don't talk nonsense, Elder Brother Yin," the holy girl purred in a gentle voice. "This person is definitely not a successor of Luoso. His strength is too weak and too far off the legacy of a martial emperor. I suspect that he was just fortunate to find a few legacies by chance... Hmm, this appearance shouldn't be his real self, and he's a talent in any case. If I can take him in as a slave, he would be much more useful than the likes of Lu Li and Yang Wanqu."</span></p>

If he cannot settle things with the Divine Sky Sect, I wouldn't trouble myself with cleaning up his mess." The holy girl's tone was grand and majestic, containing a hard-to-imagine self-confidence and boldness as if Ye Qingyu was already her slave.</span></p>

The Celestial Phoenix Maiden might wake if we delay further." Drawing one of the golden coiled-dragon spears behind his back, the prince prepared to act, saying, "This young man is very arrogant. I shall defeat him and break his spirit while leaving him a breath. If you still find him useful, I'll spare his life..."</span></p>

Like purple lightning dragons, they soared into the sky and circled around the Void. Thunder rumbled like dragon roars as the world turned into a sea of thunder liquid which was many times more overbearing than earlier when Lu Li was killed.</span></p>

Moreover, he would show no mercy also because people from the Black Moon Divine Palace had injured the First Princess Yu Junqing all those years back. This kind of goon would only be a hindrance to the Heaven Wasteland Domain if kept alive and was a degenerate of the Human Race, and thus was best slain before it was too late.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, he tasted the same sense of despair which Lu Li had earlier.</span></p>

He knew that even if he summoned his greatest powers now, he would not be able to put up a resistance.</span></p>

Every ring of his full-body golden chainmail, on which strange golden formations circulated, gave off a radiance which was as glaring as the sun. As he stood in the field of thunder and lightning, no beam of lightning could get within three meters of his body or affect him in any way.</span></p>

Originally possessing lofty ambitions, he thought that his new power would directly bring him on par with a Saint, but his heart had now turned ice-cold and tremblingly fearful. As he peered at the Third Prince's and Ye Qingyu's figures, he deeply understood that these two men's battle strength and stage were far superior to his.</span></p>

As chilly and mysterious as the moon fairy, she suspended in mid-air and, similarly, was not affected by the sea of thunder.</span></p>

I hope you can fend off two more strokes for me, don't disappoint me." The rising radiance all over Yin Kaishan's body made him resemble a revived war god.</span></p>
