Unless one had talent in this area, it was completely impossible for one to enter. With Ye Qingyu's current strength, he had absolutely no way of rescuing Yu Xiaoxing out of this prison.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The crucial point was that if he went to the prison to launch a rescue, if he was not successful the first time around, he would rattle the grass and startle the snake. The Greater One Sect would become even more cautious. They would move Xing'er away, or perhaps it would cause danger to Xing'er's safety. It was better to observe from the sidelines, and wait till there was an opportunity. It would not be too late to act then.&nbsp;</span></p>

He rubbed his head and scratched his belly, saying with a smile, "Little Nine, it's been hard on you during this period of time. Go several more times towards Xing'er, and observe well. If there is anything that changes, notify me instantly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Little Nine that had received such an excellent treatment from his master scratching his belly, joyfully wagged his tail. His furry head rubbed against Ye Qingyu, then he turned and left.</span></p>

In this entire day, Hu Bugui and the Old Fish wandered around. They basically were sneakily causing trouble for the Greater One Sect. Although they did not cause any great matters, but it caused everyone on the Greater One Sect to not have peace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Nan Tieyi did not spend many times causing trouble compared to them, but did spend the majority of the time together with them.</span></p>

It would also destroy the plans the major forces had in invading Heaven Wasteland Domain.</span></p>

With his incomparable performance that day, although people did not express goodwill towards Ye Qingyu so as to preserve the face of the Greater One Sect, but after the matters had ended, they had extended invitations to Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In the martial world, the strong was revered.</span></p>

It would naturally affect the attention of all the major sects, and would also attract the invitation of some people. This was especially so under the pretext that Ye Qingyu was under a nameless sect like the Thunder and Lightning Sect. There were many major sects that wanted to bring such a young man under their wings---- even if they could not, they could first express good will and leave a good impression behind. Perhaps it would be of good use in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Fortuitous Cauldron sent over ten pieces of Immortal metal.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Even the Nangong family sent some people to pass word on, that if Ye Qingyu was willing to work for the Nangong family, the family master of the Nangong family would be willing to give the hand in marriage of his most beloved daughter, the pearl of the Nangong family, Nangong Feng to Ye Qingyu... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Sky Demon Palace had even sent some elders over. They had stated that for Ye Qingyu, they could open the thirteenth palace in Sky Demon Palace. Ye Qingyu could become the fourth human Palace Master of the Sky Demon Palace, and would not be under the command of the other twelve palaces. He would only needed to listen to the Main Palace master. If there were other conditions that Ye Qingyu had, he only needed to state it. Such terms were extremely generous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; There was another female Patriarch of a female sect that had sent over two beautiful female disciples, wanting to use this to tempt Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Other sects such as the Star Sect, Demon Emperor Sect, Heaven Opportunity Ravine, all these sects promised exceedingly generous terms and conditions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The most laughable was the Witticism Building. They directly indicated that if Ye Qingyu would be willing to join, then the master of the Witticism Building, who was one of the top ten beauties of Clear River Domain a hundred years ago, would be willing to forego the generation gap, and marry Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; There were many strange and varied promises and benefits that were offered, causing Ye Qingyu to be unable to laugh or cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The thing that he didn’t expect the most was that even the Greater One Sect made an offer of peace. They said that everything that happened before could be like it never occurred. They would solve the eminity between him and Chen Shaohua, and Ye Qingyu could receive the same treatment Chen Shaohua received.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; In the next couple of days, matters like this constantly happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu politely declined at the start. But later on, he lost his patience and directly did not receive guests, not even giving them any attention whatsoever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The seventh day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu was sitting in a meditative pose on the bed, bitterly cultivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Through the battle, he was able to realize the terrifying power of the Lightning Serum, and the power of electricity. Therefore in this period of time, he wanted to incorporate even more Lightning Serum into him. This was the quickest way of increasing his own strength that Ye Qingyu could think of.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; At this time, he had a bare torso. He had long trousers and battle shoes on. These were all treasures that had been found in the storage room in the Underground Moonlight Immortal Palace. It was impenetrable to swords and impervious to fire or water. In the battle with Chen Shaohua that day, even the White Lotus Immortal Sword could not cause the slightest damage to his clothing. It was only a pity that the upper robes were not there. Everytime Ye Qingyu had to fight, he had to take off his outer robes first. It was most likely that for a very long time afterwards, he would have the title of a stripping demon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Purple lightning surrounded him and arcs of electricity flowed through his whole body. Ye Qingyu’s thick black hair was standing up from the electricity.</span></p>

She hurriedly apologized and explained, "Tian Huang gongzi, I had no other choice, so I had to do such a thing and infiltrate into your training room."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "No other choice?" Ye Qingyu calmly asked.</span></p>

There was a helpless dim light on Shen Menghua's face as she sighed and said, "If there was any other way, I would not have done such a thing. I am not married, so I would never have hiddenly sneaked into the chambers of a man, it's only because..." As she spoke to here, she deeply bowed. Biting her teeth, "The reason I came today was to beg that on the basis of that fact that Tian Huang gongzi is also part of the Human Race, to extend a helping hand and save the lives of thousands of girls of our Hundred Spirits Sect. I am willing to bear the crime of intruding on your training room alone.”</span></p>

He pointed to the stone chair next to him, "Please have a seat Miss Shen. Just what is the matter? Just how can I save the lives of the female disciples of the Hundred Spirits Sect? In truth, you've totally made me confused."</span></p>

They received the protection of some powerful major forces, and was in alliance with many major sects. In this domain, they could be regarded as a top level sect, and had the respect of most people.</span></p>

As a result of this, some medical arts and techniques had been lost, so they had no way of providing some medical services tothese powerful forces. They had even caused several incidents where they had misdiagnosed some issues and caused several matters. This caused the reputation of the Hundred Spirits Sect to be harmed, and their status rapidly deteriorated. Their glory of the past could not be regained, and they slowly lost the regard of these powerful forces.&nbsp;</span></p>

Whether it was man or woman, they would enter into the demonic way through lust. Both men and women in the sect were perverted, brutal and evil people.</span></p>

When there was an urgent disease, one had to seek medical aid everywhere. They ultimately could only seek out Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
