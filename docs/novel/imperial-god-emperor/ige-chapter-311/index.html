 <p>“This is the inside of the divine gate, the so called palace of the [Base of the Formation Sovereign]?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could see a blood red ocean in front of his eyes. There was a shock in his heart that was hard to describe using words.</p>
 <p>The instant they passed through the divine gate, he could faintly sense people cursing at the 'pretty boy'. He could not help but chuckle at their reaction. The vision in front of him became clearer and clearer. Ye Qingyu did not imagine that the inside of the divine gate would look like this at all.</p>
 <p>The moment they stepped past the divine gate, the place they set their foot down was the classic little dock of an island.</p>
 <p>The dim red rock was filled with the signs of erosion caused by the crashing of the waves. The entire island was not larger than an acre, it was like a rock protruding from out of the sea. It was incomparably smooth, and it was unknown for how long it had stood there. At the edges of the island, there was a simple rock, and one could clearly see the markings of its workmanship. It was unknown just how long it had withstood being hit by the blood red ocean.</p>
 <p>There was a wet rope that was tied to a small rock jutting out.</p>
 <p>On the other side of the rope was a little raft that could barely hold ten people.</p>
 <p>Apart from this, the sky was dim and dark. All one could see was the dim red cloud and the surrounding endless red sea. Although there was not the smell of blood emitting from the ocean, but there was evidently the colour of blood from the surging ocean. This bright and fresh colour was evidently the same as the endless ocean.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere of the surroundings was extremely strange.</p>
 <p>"Eh? You've come? Are you okay?" The instant Ximen Yeshui saw Ye Qingyu's figure appear, he was overjoyed. He dragged Ye Qingyu, evaluating him from top to bottom, looking to see if Ye Qingyu had any missing limbs. Only after did he relax.</p>
 <p>"Woof, you really are an unreliable fellow. You nearly caused my master to die," Little Nine angrily berated him. "If you don't have the ability, then don't drag my master along. You're useless, so you nearly caused others to die."</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui's expression was guilty. He had no way of rebuking such words.</p>
 <p>Even though he had powerful strength, but he had just left his master and had not gained enough experience as of yet. He did not imagine someone would use a Dao tool and nearly caused Ye Qingyu to die as a result of his actions.</p>
 <p>"This was my carelessness..." Ximen Yeshui scratched his head in apology.</p>
 <p>"Woof, woof, carelessness, you dare speak such words? I beg you, don't be careless next time, you'll cause more people to die." Little Nine was not willing to let him go so easily.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu covered LIttle NIne's mouth, preventing him from saying anything more and causing chaos. With a smile, "You don't have to feel guilty. You had good intentions, I understand."</p>
 <p>In truth, in such a situation, for Ximen Yeshui to still insist on bringing Ye Qingyu to the divine gate meant that he truly treated Ye Qingyu as his brother. After being attacked from behind, he wanted to save the situation, but it was that he had already entered the divine gate. He had even tried to rush out. This was not just acting or pretending, these were his true emotions.</p>
 <p>After experiencing such a situation, Ye Qingyu had truly let down his last traces of suspicion and treated this man who was easily lost as a true friend.</p>
 <p>"Rest assured, I will definitely protect you. If anyone dares attack you, I will kill them." Ximen Yeshui pointed to the sky as he swore an oath.</p>
 <p>"Wuwu... woof, master, don't cover my mouth," Little Nine struggled out, looking at Ximen Yeshui. With a sniff, "That sounds about right."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu grabbed this little fellow into his embrace and inspected him carefully. "Are you alright?"</p>
 <p>"Master, are you worried about me?" Little Nine was incomparably excited, jumping onto Ye Qingyu's shoulder and began intimately licking Ye Qingyu's face using his tender little tongue. "Of course I’m fine, I am very amazing. As long as you are fine, master."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could not help but be a little emotionally moved.</p>
 <p>Although he normally was not that reliable at all, and liked to cause trouble everywhere, but in such a situation, he used his own body to protect against the incoming attacks. From this, one could see just how important Ye Qingyu was in Little Nine’s eyes.</p>
 <p>He had to treat this fellow a little better in the future.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu silently said in his heart.</p>
 <p>As they spoke, there were lights flickering on the island.</p>
 <p>There were people constantly appearing.</p>
 <p>The armoured old man appeared.</p>
 <p>A muscular warrior enveloped in armour appeared.</p>
 <p>Then the expert wielding the meteor hammer also appeared.</p>
 <p>As well as the middle-aged swordsman who Ximen Yeshui had defeated.</p>
 <p>There were also two experts that hd not attracted their attention that appeared from the divine gate, landing on the island.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, apart from Song Xiaojun, Ximen Yeshui, Ye Qingyu, and Qin Zhishui, there were six other people.</p>
 <p>"It's you? So it was a bastard like you who ambushed me just now?" Ximen Yeshui looked at the expert wielding the black meteor hammer, and could not help but be enraged. He advanced on him threateningly, "I did not imagine you would be able to enter. We should settle our grudges now."</p>
 <p>The other person looked to be around thirty years of age, with an eagle hooked nose and angular cheekbones. His figure was taller than average. His expression was dark as he heard this, an anger fishing through his eyes. But he ultimately took a step back, "In such a situation, attacking was an instinctive action. Since your friend is fine, and you've both successfully passed through, why must you force things to such a conclusion?"</p>
 <p>"Don't speak so much, just fight," Ximen Yeshui rolled up his sleeve and said tyrannically.</p>
 <p>"Hmph, do you think I'm afraid?" The eagle nosed man's expression also became sinister.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere turned tense.</p>
 <p>"Both, both, first wait, don't act," the previous armoured old man that acted as a mediator, once again stood out. He blocked both with a smile, "Have you all not realized that our yuan qi in such a location has all been suppressed?"</p>
 <p>What?</p>
 <p>Yuan qi was suppressed?</p>
 <p>There was astoundment on the faces of everyone.</p>
 <p>There were some with a calm expression, evidently having long discovered such a fact.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui had a stunned face. With careful inspection, he discovered that the yuan qi within his body was suppressed by a mysterious power. It was previously not discovered by him, but as long as he tried to activate his cultivation, he discovered that his yuan qi was frozen in his dantian world. There was no way of using it like normal.</p>
 <p>Song Xiaojun wore a mask, it was not possible to see her expression.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu could be sure, that the ice yuan qi within his body also had no way of fluctuating.</p>
 <p>Only the [Supreme Ice Flame] in his dantian world was unrestricted by the mysterious power. It seemed to be able to be used to a certain extent. Only seeing this could he rest assured.</p>
 <p>The expressions of the other people were all about the same.</p>
 <p>Those powerful and might experts relied on yuan qi. It was the energy for all of their abilities.</p>
 <p>Once they lost their yuan qi and only relied on their bodies to fight, they would lose far, far too much of their power. It could not help but make them feel unsafe.</p>
 <p>"Look, what is that?"</p>
 <p>Someone pointed at the sky in shock.</p>
 <p>As they followed along the direction of the finger, they could see as the wind blew past. It blew the dim red clouds of the sky away, and there was a strange red colour appeared. This blood red light hung in the sky, incomparably huge, forming a strange pattern.</p>
 <p>"It's a letter!”</p>
 <p>"A letter of the God and Devil Age?"</p>
 <p>"What does it mean?"</p>
 <p>Everyone discussed.</p>
 <p>"It means 'common’," Ye Qingyu opened his mouth.</p>
 <p>He had once studied the characters of the God and Devil Age, and after slight inspection, he was able to recognize the massive bloody letter that hung in the sky.</p>
 <p>"Common?" Some people were taken aback.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded his head. "That's right, it's the common character from a mortal."</p>
 <p>The blood red large letter in the red sky, was namely the 'common’ character.</p>
 <p>At this time, everyone could sense that the mysterious power that suppressed the inner yuan within their bodies so that it had no way of freely flow, originated from the huge blood [Common] character hanging in the air.</p>
 <p>"Could it be... could it mean that it will reduce our power so that we would become like a common person?" the middle-aged swordsman questioned with a pale face.</p>
 <p>"Perhaps." the expression of the eagle nosed man was also somewhat hard to look at.</p>
 <p>If he could not use yuan qi, it meant that he had no way of controlling the Dao tool, meteor hammer. For him, this was a massive weakening in strength.</p>
 <p>"Everyone, let's not guess too much. What has happened, has happened. Since we have entered through the divine gate, this is a fortuitous encounter that has something to do with the legacy of the [Formation Sovereign]. We are warriors of the Human Race, why must we fight amongst ourselves. The atmosphere is strange on this island. From the current situation, we need to travel on the little raft through the ocean. There must be danger ahead. At this time, we must cooperate with sincerity with each other."</p>
 <p>Another expert covered with a black robe also spoke, " that's right, we came for the legacy of the [Formation Sovereign]. This is something that concerns the hope of the Human Race. One more person is one more hope. At this time, everyone should not fight amongst themselves.</p>
 <p>The mouth of the middle-aged swordsman also moved.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu grabbed Ximen Yeshui, indicating that he should endure it for now.</p>
 <p>He somehow felt that the aura of the blood red ocean surrounding the island was wrong. There must be something bizarre that might happen in the near future, so they should not distract themselves by fighting these people.</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui could only give this matter up. Giving a glare to the eagle nosed man, he said, "brat, wait a bit."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nearly spat our something.</p>
 <p>This Ximen Yeshui was sometimes like a childish little kid.</p>
 <p>"Everyone, if we want to discover the legacy of the [Formation Sovereign], perhaps we need to cross this blood red sea. Look, there were four rocks that were used to hold the ropes. In other words, there were once four little rafts that were here. the people that came here before us, already departed using these rafts…”</p>
 <p>The armoured old man pointed at the little dock.</p>
 <p>At this time, everyone fell silent and looked towards the little dock.</p>
 <p>the situation was really as the armoured old man had described.</p>
 <p>Everyone clearly knew that before they came, the divine gate had already opened several times. There were people that had previously entered, and these people did not appear on the blood red ocean island. This meant that they had already left.</p>
 <p>There was no meaning in remaining on the blood red island.</p>
 <p>If they wanted to find the legacy of the [Formation Sovereign], they must travel through the sea using the raft.</p>
 <p>But...</p>
 <p>Everyone's gaze landed on the little raft.</p>
 <p>The raft was dark red and seemed to be made from an unknown material. After being constantly bombarded by the blood red sea waves, it had already rotted completely. It looked like a decrepit piece of wood. It seemed like if a large wave struck it, it would turn into wooden scraps. Furthermore, the body of the raft was extremely small. Even at the most optimistic estimate, it could only hold ten people.</p>
 <p>Could such a raft really travel through the ocean?</p>
