 <p>Chapter 238 - Break apart the legend</p>
 <p>“You… arrogance!" The other white faced beardless middle-aged man coldly sneered. "In Jianghu, everyone says that Ye Qingyu is a killing demon without emotions. I originally did not believe this, at least the military department had given you the titled of a heroic and loyal Marquis. I thought that you had to have something special. But from the situation right now, it seems like I was wrong. No respect for your elders, arrogant and wild, slaughtering your own race, treacherous… that person is you, Ye Qingyu!" </p>
 <p> The white face middle-aged man was evidently the higher up of a sect, with a distinctive and special aura. When he was young, he must be a handsome man. When his anger was invoked, there was a pressuring aura that was given off.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu pressed his lips together in disdain.</p>
 <p> Who did not know how to accuse someone.</p>
 <p> If accusing someone was able to solve problems, then what was the point of the Patrolling sword envoy? </p>
 <p> Therefore tonight, Ye Qingyu did not even think about reasoning with this bunch of people.</p>
 <p> As long as you think a little, you would be able to realize that the people who arrived the quickest after the hidden array was destroyed must be the people who had some sort of relationship with the army camp. They were definitely not good people. And yet they were still using the same methods of threat and intimidation here; these Jianghu people, did they think that such methods worked everywhere? "It's fine if you don't state your name. After all, none of you is innocent. When I've captured you and interrogated you, I'll find out then." </p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu was too lazy to argue with these people.</p>
 <p> "Hahaha, you are really crazy. Today I will stand here. Ye Qingyu, if you have the ability, then capture me." </p>
 <p> White Browed Yu could not help but chuckle out loud. Even if Ye Qingyu was the Marquis, he was not afraid. This Ye Qingyu really was overestimating himself if he wanted to use his position as Marquis to suppress the people of the Jianghu.</p>
 <p> The other two men also laughed.</p>
 <p> The martial cultivation of the sects, was much more detailed and intricate than the experts who had originated from the army. It was not something the experts of the armies were able to withstand. An example of the difference between these groups was their observation skills. The two middle-aged men were the elders of the top three schools and top sects, and had been famous for many years. They were able to discern with one glance that the Ye Qingyu described as legendary by other people, was only at the thirty Spirit springs stage. He was only a slightly strong junior, just what great turmoil could he cause… </p>
 <p> The White Browed Yu was one of the rising stars of the younger generation in the Setting Sun and Great River sect. Many years ago, he had already stepped into the realm of the Fifty Spirit springs. And in these years, his martial cultivation had improved even more. His battle record was extremely fearsome in the Jianghu, and it was hard to find someone that was able to fight against him at the same age. There was a difference when compared to the young leaders of the six top sects, but facing an arrogant person only at the thirty Spirit springs stage, how could Ye Qingyu not easily fall into his hands? </p>
 <p> The Ye Qingyu just how had he became so famous.</p>
 <p> But he really was far too arrogant.</p>
 <p> Fine, then today he would decisively destroy this person that was known as the little legend of the [Youyan army]. He would make the entire military know what was the true power of the sects in case they thought that because this tiny little officer was able to defeat the Xuan sect, the [Five Poisons Gongzi]; this represented they could step all over the top six sects.</p>
 <p> Opposite.</p>
 <p> "People really won't cry until they see the coffin." </p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu shook his head, slowly moving his body.</p>
 <p> Thirty Snow Dragon illusions, like flowing light, shot our roaring from within his body. In the wind all around him, there was suddenly a chill in the air with dragon roars. There was an indistinct quiver in the air that gradually became clearer and clearer. Ye Qingyu's aura was like the surging tide, becoming even more and more violent, like the forming of an avalanche. Slowly and slowly, force built up, becoming a power that nothing could stand in his way! </p>
 <p> White Browed Yu coldly sneered.</p>
 <p> "Your strength is definitely powerful amongst those of the thirty Spirit springs. But compared to me, the difference is far too great," he said sneeringly. "Ice attribute yuan qi is far too commonly seen. And what is even more of a pity is that…" Saying that, he slowly and grandly flicked his finger, and an orange flame suddenly came from the tip of his finger. With mockery, "What is even more of a pity, is that your ice inner yuan is coincidentally completely suppressed by the power of my fire!" </p>
 <p> A surge of hot air followed along with the appearance of the orange flame that began originating from White Browed Yu.</p>
 <p> Next to him, there was also a slight smile of mockery on the faces of the middle-aged men of the sects.</p>
 <p> Opposite.</p>
 <p> There was also an expression of mockery on Ye Qingyu's face.</p>
 <p> "Does flames really always suppress ice?" His lips split apart, his white teeth like the glimmer of blades under the glow of the moonlight. "What kind of retard told you that? That’s right, you must feel that thirty Spririt springs of cultivation is not enough. Then right now…" </p>
 <p> As he said these words.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu activated the [First limit] of the [Limitless Divine Way].</p>
 <p> Boom! </p>
 <p> Light winds erupted.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu's yuan qi power instantly doubled.</p>
 <p> "Aoooooooo…” </p>
 <p> The roar of dragons was like a bell sounding out in the skies, spreading everywhere in the wind, causing one’s ear drums to shudder.</p>
 <p> His aura, in that instant, madly and mercilessly grew.</p>
 <p> If Ye Qingyu's previous aura was like the roaring tides of the sea, then at this moment, it had already turned into a surging tsunami. A chill in the air spread rapidly throughout the surroundings as if it was light. Everywhere it passed, everything was frozen. The floating scraps of grass and dust in the air were also instantly frozen, as if even space itself had froze.</p>
 <p> Boom! </p>
 <p> A powerful gust advanced towards White Browed Yu and the others.</p>
 <p> "How can this be…" The pupils of White Browed Yu constricted.</p>
 <p> The expressions of the two middle-aged men behind him also suddenly transformed.</p>
 <p> His strength suddenly doubled? </p>
 <p> This… was it a joke? </p>
 <p> The foundations of the top sects were vast and deep. They had all sorts of miraculous techniques, but they have never heard of such a terrifying technique that could instantly double someone’s strength… Could it be an evil technique that burned the foundation of the user's own life… this Ye Qingyu, was he mad? </p>
 <p> And when their hearts were greatly shaken, Ye Qingyu acted.</p>
 <p> His figurer flashed. In but several steps, he were already before White Browed Yu.</p>
 <p> His palm struck out; his aura like thunder.</p>
 <p> White Browed Yu let out a scream, the power of his flames exploding.</p>
 <p> His entire person was surrounded by a barrier of orange flames, like a deity that was born in fire. Both his knees slightly bent, his arms raising. His left half drew a half arc towards the right, his right arm drew another arc towards the left that looked to be an extremely practiced movement. It seemed slow, but in reality was utterly fast. Palm after palm formed, layers after layers, like the thousand hand Buddha. In an instant, everywhere around the air were palms of fire.</p>
 <p> "The [Thousand Palms of Flames][1] !" "His first move is his famous technique!" </p>
 <p> The hearts of the two middle-aged men were also taken back.</p>
 <p> The Setting Sun and Great River sect definitely had its profoundness. This [Thousand Palms of Flames] was in reality an extremely intricate martial art. In an instant, countless palms strikes could be formed. With the increase in the number of palms, the power would also increase. Although it could not instantly cause a direct multiplication in its effects, it could cause one’s battle strength to multiply instantly. This technique was extremely profound.</p>
 <p> White Browed Yu was known as the [Flame Master]. he obtained his titled through the [Thousand Palms of Flames] using this to defeat an unknown number of opponents whose cultivation exceeded him.</p>
 <p> The moment this move was exhibited, the hearts of the two middle-aged men finally settled down.</p>
 <p> But— </p>
 <p> The next moment.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu's palm, like mad thunder, firmly struck at the center of the myriad of flame palms.</p>
 <p> This was the location of the real palm of White Browed Yu.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu had really found it.</p>
 <p> The cold qi advanced.</p>
 <p> The orange flame that spread throughout flickered, then disappeared.</p>
 <p> What also disappeared was the scorching heat of that flame.</p>
 <p> What was replaced was an endless cold.</p>
 <p> Silver dragons constricted around Ye Qingyu's body. Shards of ice danced around him like butterflies, and there was a layer of silver frost around his palm. The moment his palm struck White Browed Yu's palm, this layer of frost was like an unstoppable maggot that burrowed into White Browed Yu's arm, and grew and extended. Accompanied by White Browed Yu's shocked expression, it had already instantly dug deep within his body… </p>
 <p> White Browed Yu reacted instinctively to save his own life, retreating and wanting to extend the distance.</p>
 <p> But it was like their palms were stuck together. He had no way of escaping from Ye Qingy's palms.</p>
 <p> He wanted to open his mouth and loudly scream, but the silver frost had already sealed away his mouth and nose. No sounds could be emitted.</p>
 <p> The flames in his body were madly activated. Under the silver frost, there was flicker after flicker of flame that was like fire under the ground that was about to erupt. But ultimately, it was completely sealed away by that layer of ice… </p>
 <p> In the blink of an eye, White Browed Yu had turned and transformed into an ice sculpture.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu lifted his palm away.</p>
 <p> "White Browed… haha, just how disgusting were your white brows. Look, I've helped you turn your entire body white, you can just change your name to White White Yu now. " Ye Qingyu smiled slightly. The result of this palm made him exceedingly satisfied.</p>
 <p> With the activation of the [First Limit] of the [Limitless Divine Way] his battle strength had instantly doubled. He had defeated White Browed Yu in one strike, this was his normal strength.</p>
 <p> But the state of the [First Limit] could only be maintained for the length of time of a quarter stick of incense.</p>
 <p> He must finish the battle quickly.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu's gaze once again fell on the figures of the two middle-aged men.</p>
 <p> His palm grabbed something in the air, and the [Little Shang sword] that was as bright as autumn waters was summoned from the waters of his Spirit spring. With a flicker, it landed at the center of his palm.</p>
 <p> [Soul Stealing Heaven Strike]![2] </p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu used one of the [Four Moves of the Unmatched General]. The strange light of the [Little Shang sword] glowed, and like a ghost, he instantly arrived before the middle-aged man with the long beard.</p>
 <p> This person was immediately terrified, his sword also unsheathed, wanting to strike back… </p>
 <p> But Ye Qingyu would not give him a chance.</p>
 <p> Ding! </p>
 <p> The instant the swords met, an invisible sealing power struck the body of the middle-aged man.</p>
 <p> All the inner yuan in his body was forced into a state of inactivity </p>
 <p> This brief moment where he could not use his inner yuan was already fatal.</p>
 <p> [Storm of Swords].</p>
 <p> The instant cold qi exploded, the [Little Shang sword] had already turned into sword shadows everywhere in the skies that enveloped the middle-aged man.</p>
 <p> By the time his inner yuan could fluctuate normally, he had already been hit twenty times by the swords. Although he had powerful yuan qi protecting his body and these swords were not enough to directly cut him into pieces, but there were faint traces of the sword scars left on his body. This was already enough. The terrifying cold qi and the even more terrifying power of the [Supreme Ice flame] began invading into his body.</p>
 <p> If Ye Qingyu's yuan qi today was enough to completely freeze and erase the middle-aged man, then the [Supreme Ice flame] was even more of a power he could not oppose no matter what. Like steel needles, it traveled throughout his meridians, causing his energy to have no way to activate through his channels.</p>
 <p> The middle-aged man was not any different from a person at the peak of the Ordinary martial level at this current state.</p>
 <p> Ye Qingyu lifted his leg, striking his chest. Like hitting a broken wooden doll, he was sent flying.</p>
 <p> And at this time, the attack of the other middle-aged man arrived, but it was already too late to save his comrade.</p>
 <p> "I'll kill you…" The white faced man without a beard was enraged; a killing intent flickering madly in his eyes.</p>
