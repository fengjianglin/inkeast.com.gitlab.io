 <p>289 - Shocking news</p>
 <p>"I'm a little hungry."</p>
 <p>On Bai Yuanxing's covered face, a smile finally appeared.</p>
 <p>There was a fragrance emitting from the pot.</p>
 <p>Jin Ling'er quickly filled a full bowl for Bai Yuanxing.</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing had one or two bites, then nodded his head, "En, it's fragrant. it seems like it's dog meat. My body is still recovering, I can't eat too much meat or fish. I'll just have the broth."</p>
 <p>"Fine, fine, you drink some more." The big headed dog was eating, lapping his lips as he excitedly lay next to the pot of stew. After a while, he suddenly realized something and reacted. He blinked his eyes, "What? Blind kid... no, Little Bai, what did you say, it's dog meat? Could you have smelled something wrongly?"</p>
 <p>Bai Yuanxing shook his head with a smile. "This is definitely the taste of dog meat. That's right, officer Wen said he had killed a little black dog an hour ago, this must be it's meat."</p>
 <p>Little Nine acted as if he was struck by lightning, standing there dumbly for a few seconds, unable to process what had happened.</p>
 <p>After a short moment.</p>
 <p>"Ah, Wen Wan, I'll slaughter you, I'll tear your skin off..." The silly dog tragically screamed, as if he had gone crazy. He shot out like a bolt of lightning out the tent, and his enraged cry could be heard from the outside, "Ahhhh, Wen Wan, you dog killer, where are you, scram out!"</p>
 <p>Within the tent.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu laughed.</p>
 <p>Seeing Bai Yuanxing's mood turn for the better, he could finally be less worried.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>In the next few days, the military power of the Youyan army also began to be mobilized more frequently.</p>
 <p>Military order after military order began to be sent out from the Pass Lord's Residence.</p>
 <p>There was formation airship after formation airship that was filled with the soldiers of the Youyan Pass that headed in the direction of the Explosive Snow Glacier. This time it was not only the Vanguard, all the other major camps were also sent out. The newly created [Fury Camp] was allocated outside the Pass, and was temporarily not sent to the frontlines of the battlefield.</p>
 <p>Such a situation was commonly seen in the last decades. Every year, when the Youyan army launched the Springtime offence season, was the time the demon race suffered the most. The Youyan army had already gotten used to everything.</p>
 <p>In this period of time, the most important thing was what occurred to the Zhang San of the Military supply department in Youyan Pass. For some unknown reason, he was temporarily relieved of his role, and was not responsible for the supply lines of the Youyan army. It was temporarily taken over by the [Painting Saint], Liu Yuqing.</p>
 <p>Such news only spread out in a small circle.</p>
 <p>But the power of such news could be counted as explosive.</p>
 <p>Who was not aware that after Zhang San had been in the Youyan Pass for so many years, his roots were as deep as a great tree. It was even rumoured that Zhang San had some deep relationship with the [War God of Youyan Pass] Lu Zhaoge. No matter what happened previously, even if the Military Supply Department committed some great wrong, the Pass Lord's Residence had never punished them before.</p>
 <p>If it was the past Youyan Pass, apart from Lu Zhaoge, there was only the Zhang San of the Military Supply Department that was like an immovable mountain. Even the influence of the commanders of the four main camps could not be compared to Zhang San.</p>
 <p>But who would have thought this tree of the Youyan army would fall.</p>
 <p>Some guesses and rumours began to circulate.</p>
 <p>Those who received the quickest news, largely guessed at something. The most reasonable explanation was that Zhang San had walked too closely with the people of the sects. He had participated in some matters, that forced Lu Zhaoge to take such a measure.</p>
 <p>But there were still many people who did not realize the true reason behind this.</p>
 <p>Those who truly understood the upper echelon of the Youyan army, realized the incredibility of this.</p>
 <p>Because the errors that Zhang San had committed previously had exceeded and was more ridiculous than the matters with the sects right now. Lu Zhaoge had chosen to ignore such matters in the past. But why was it that this time, even when Zhang San had not gotten himself involved too deeply, and the whole matter was just some battle of honour between the sects and the army, that he was punished? Furthermore, because Ye Qingyu had appeared, the Youyan army won completely, so there was no need for Lu Zhaoge to be enraged.</p>
 <p>Even Ye Qingyu felt something was strange.</p>
 <p>But he was delighted to see such a result.</p>
 <p>Ever since arriving in Youyan Pass, the military commander he disliked the most was definitely Zhang San. It was not only because they had conflicted over issues many times. It was because Ye Qingyu hated the way Zhang San did things. In Ye Qingyu's eyes, Zhang San was an arrogant, greedy person, the ringleader of the cliques.</p>
 <p>On the tenth day, Ye Qingyu finally obtained what he wanted from the hands of Lu Zhaoge.</p>
 <p>[Lotus Fire of the Black Moon].</p>
 <p>This was one of the requests Ye Qingyu made to Lu Zhaoge when he was treating his injuries.</p>
 <p>It was rumoured that only the Imperial family of Snow Empire possessed such a strange flame. That was why, even with the ability of Lu Zhaoge, it took such a long time for him to obtain this. From this, one could tell just how precious it was.</p>
 <p>Such a treasure was given directly by the successor of the Youyan army, Ye Congyun.</p>
 <p>"So this is the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] from the legends!"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked at the starlight that was brightly flickering within the formation crystal orb. He was shocked because this light that was like a star in the night did not seem like a flame at all. It was a cross-shaped starlight, faintly flickering. Through the barrier of the crystal orb, no sense of heat could be felt whatsoever, like it was an illusion.</p>
 <p>"This afternoon, the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] arrived to the Pass Lord's Residence. My master ordered me to deliver it over at the first instance," Ye Congyun gave his respects to Ye Qingyu. With his identity today, although his military position was not high, but he was the successor of Lu Zhaoge. Judging by the weight of his words in Youyan Pass alone, this little military officer of the Pass had more weight than even Ye Qingyu. But he deeply knew that the only reason he could become who he was today was due to Ye Qingyu's help. Furthermore, he deeply remembered what Lu Zhaoge had said. So apart from feeling grateful to Ye Qingyu, he also had respect and admiration towards him.</p>
 <p>“Give my thanks to Pass Lord Lu.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu smiled. Although he had not seen the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] before, but he believed that with Lu Zhaoge's status and identity, he would not fool him. He stowed the crystal orb away.</p>
 <p>"Marquis is being too courteous. This [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] is originally something that master desperately needed. That day, because of the attack of the Queen of the Unmoving City of Darkness, he was injured. He needed the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] to ensure that his wounds could recover. The Youyan army sent out desperate pleas for help to the capital to ask for assistance but such cries for assistance were blocked by the Right Minister. So this flame could not arrive in time in Youyan Pass. Thankfully, you provided your aid, otherwise..." Ye Congyun's said in a somewhat resentful tone as he mentioned the Capital. "Afterwards, when master's wounds healed, we needed to send more people to chase up on the progress of this flame. Only then could we obtain the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon]. I hope this delay has not interfered with your business."</p>
 <p>"Oh, so it was like this?" Ye Qingyu finally realized something.</p>
 <p>At this moment, he finally understood what the ‘transaction’ they were referring to meant in that battle between Song Xiaojun and Lu Zhaoge. This was the reason why Song Xiaojun stayed within Youyan Pass, it was because there was perhaps the existence of the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] within the Pass Lord's Residence.</p>
 <p>That day, Song Xiaojun had cooperated with Yan Buhui to ambush Lu Zhaoge. This was not to really kill Lu Zhaoge, but to injure the [War God of Youyan Pass]. It forced Lu Zhaoge to request for the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] to treat his wounds from the Imperial family of Snow Empire. As long as the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon] arrived in Youyan Pass, then she and Xian'er could steal away the Lotus Fire.</p>
 <p>Perhaps even Yan Buhui that day did not really want to kill Lu Zhaoge?</p>
 <p>Many questions and suspicions that were always within his heart began to spread out.</p>
 <p>After all, if she wanted to obtain the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon], it would be easier to obtain it in the Youyan Pass compared to the Capital that was strictly guarded, with as many experts as the clouds.</p>
 <p>But just what was Song Xiaojun's objective in obtaining the [Lotus Fire of the Black Moon]?</p>
 <p>Evidently, it was very important for her. That was why she did not care about making the entire Youyan Pass or even the entire Empire as her enemy, that she would even ambush Lu Zhaoge</p>
 <p>"That's right, my master told me to pass on this message to you. Perhaps in a few days, Marquis, you will receive an order coming from the capital. You will leave Youyan Pass and head off for the capital to take up a post there," Ye Congyun said.</p>
 <p>"What?" Ye Qingyu was taken aback. "Head off to the capital?"</p>
 <p>Ye Congyun nodded, saying seriously, "Perhaps because you have been in closed isolation training these days so you did not realize the news. Ever since the martial alliance meeting at Proud Sky Center, many people have begun to notice you. In truth, not only the Youyan army but the entire Imperial family was paying attention to this event. It was even said that there was some important person of the Imperial family that went personally to view this, and was exceedingly satisfied with your performance. Especially the words you said after you killed Zhao Shanhe. There is news that comes from the capital, that the Emperor wants to give you an important duty in the capital!”</p>
 <p>So it was like this?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was greatly shocked.</p>
 <p>Such a result had far exceeded his original plan.</p>
 <p>To be stationed at the Capital?</p>
 <p>To be appreciated by the Snow Emperor?</p>
 <p>This was not within his original plans at all.</p>
 <p>"Is such a matter believable?" Ye Qingyu asked again.</p>
 <p>Ye Congyun replied respectfully. "if it came from the mouth of other people, then this is hard to tell. There are far too much information being spread about throughout the Jianghu or the Imperial Court. But since master told me to tell Marquis such news, then it should be true," saying this, Ye Congyun clasped his hands respectfully. "I give you my congratulations. For you to receive the appreciation of the Snow Emperor and head towards the capital, you will definitely receive an important duty. You will definitely head straight for the clouds and have a limitless future.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu shook his head. With a faint smile, he said, "If it was really like this, this may not be too great a thing. Although Youyan Pass is situated at the bitter cold borders, but you can control the entire situation within Youyan Pass. Even if there are Jianghu people being restless, they cannot cause too many waves. But the situation in the Capital is chaotic and treacherous. It is one of the most terrifying hidden killing grounds of Heaven Wasteland Domain. I am only a tiny little fourth class Marquis. If I am swept up within such currents, it is hard to tell what will happen to me."</p>
 <p>"Your fortune is great and deep. Furthermore, you have the care of elder Dugu and elder Ouyang, so you should be fine. Master has already made some preparations, and gave some introductions to some old friends within the capital. After you enter the capital, you can go find such people." As Ye Congyun said this, he took out a letter and handed it over to Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"Oh? In other words, Pass Lord Lu agrees that I should head towards the capital?" Ye Qingyu finally captured the meaning within Ye Congyun's words.</p>
