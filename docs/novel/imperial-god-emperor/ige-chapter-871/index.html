Every time he comes, Guo Xiong and Guo Yi were very happy to see him and treated Ning'er as their son. Every time that Ning'er breaks something the brothers would secretly take the blame for him. I couldn't bear to see him punished by my late husband... It seems that even until death, he was still thinking about Ning'er, worried that he would be in danger and tried to stop the people who were after us...”</span></p>

At one of the corners there was a small, very strange double diamond-shaped black pattern.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hui took the ragged cloth and carefully examined the pattern on the cloth, when her eyes suddenly flashed a hint of panic, as though she had thought of something very terrifying, “It's Cang Li! This is the pattern on his enforcement robe. In the entire Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, only he wears this pattern, how could... he personally chased us down to this place!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Cang Li had already reached the Immortal Step realm hundreds of years ago. The enforcement elder of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect was vicious and ruthless, and always made swift and decisive actions. In the entire Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, his status could be said to be second only to the late Patriarch Tian Huayu. After Tian Huayu died in the Black Demon Abyss, Elder Cang Li immediately rebelled along with many confidants and killed the son of Tian Huayu. Following that the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect also fell apart. &nbsp;</span></p>

In the hundreds of years that he had been secretly training core disciples, there was a total of twenty people, and their respective families also lived here, but now there are only six bodies in the entire building. Where did the other people go...” After the initial panic, Qin Hui suddenly thought of something, then looked to Ye Qingyu with an anxious expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After listening to Qin Hui, Ye Qingyu roughly understood everything.&nbsp;</span></p>

He turned to look at Qin Hui, saying, “Madam Qin, you should be familiar with the area of the Ancient Sky Dragon Domain. Do you know where Guo Xiong's finger is pointing to?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hui was taken aback.</span></p>

There are still people living there. It is a military base city, which the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect is in charge of...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand... In that case, let's go to this place called Yu Leaf City first, and maybe we'll have some news about the disciples and their family.” Ye Qingyu made a decision after some contemplation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Qin Hui was a woman, but after so many years of following Tian Yunlong to take care of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, she naturally was thoughtful and cautious. From what Ye Qingyu had said and the clue in Guo Xiong's hand, she also immediately understood that it was some clues that Guo Xiong had left behind before he died.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, let's first go to Yu Leaf City. Whether they are there or not, at least we can find out some information first. It’s just that... Lord Ye Qingyu, can you give me some time to bury the corpses of the disciples. They ended up like this all because of Ning'er and I.” Qin Hui's heart was burning with hatred. She wanted to rush to Yu Leaf City to look for the family of the deceased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand, the deceased is more important. They should have a place to settle in this vast desert” Ye Qingyu nodded, looked at Luo Yi and said, “Go.” &nbsp;</span></p>

Each roar of the wind, mixed with sand and stones, was like a blunt knife swiftly swirling past, and could simply cut a person into pieces instantly.&nbsp;</span></p>

And inside of the light shield, the air was fresh and clean, and the temperature was cool and comfortable. It was as if they had come to another time and space. Outside of the shield, the yellow sand and stone were like beasts pouncing over, and the tornado resembled a python sweeping away everything. But no matter how they ravaged, they were completely blocked outside the hundred meters of space.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was like an ordinary person. But there was a faint, almost imperceptible silver halo of light encircled around him, and the qi field that was invisible was becoming incredibly powerful...&nbsp;</span></p>

In an instant they had already traveled a distance of hundreds of kilometers.&nbsp;</span></p>

Given his strength, no matter what astonishing behaviour or activity he had done, it was still an extraordinarily normal thing for him in the eyes of Luo Yi and Little Nine. Only Qin Hui was amazed. Ever since she had witnessed Ye Qingyu killing the traitor disciples of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect with an ice sword, this was the second time she had personally felt the power of the [Ice Sword Killing God].&nbsp;</span></p>

What she was excited was that she was now more and more confident that, not only could Ye Qingyu save her and Ning'er, but also that, with his support, put down the rebellion and get rid of those traitors. &nbsp;</span></p>

It was not a particularly brilliant technique to use for traveling but if this space law were used in assassination and intrusion, it would have the most terrifying effect. Ye Qingyu wanted to comprehend the secrets of this law, which was also a way of practicing anytime and anywhere.</span></p>

More than half of the hundreds of meters of city wall had collapsed, like a dead dragon python hiding in the sand. At this time only about less than one hundred meters of walls was above the sandy soil, and around the walls there were the roofs of a small number of broken buildings and pillars near the palace, as well as what seemed to be the heads of statues. &nbsp;</span></p>
