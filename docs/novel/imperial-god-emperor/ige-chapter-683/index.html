 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was dressed in a fiery red long dress, incomparably gorgeous, and with dense flames flowing around. The style of the long dress was peculiar, revealing her slender shoulders, which were smooth and soft. Her body was extremely perfect, the not too thick dress vaguely outlined her slender and straight legs and slender waist. On her feet were black boots made of animal skin. Her hair was drawn in a tall bun, and her whole body was radiating with a threatening beauty. Her delicate, fair face was crossed with a strange look as she stared at Ye Qingyu with a smile. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only then that Ye Qingyu snapped out of his daze.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smile bloomed on the woman's face when she heard this. She walked a few steps forward, swaying gently and beautifully, seeming to show her beautiful body, before she said in a sweet and charming voice, “What, don't tell me that brother Qingyu hoped that I am dead?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your family has set up a tombstone for you, your parents thought you have died and are incredibly upset. They have gone to the Snow capital to search for your body.” Ye Qingyu looked at the woman in front of him. Even he himself, at this moment, also did not know what kind of emotions he was feeling. “When I passed Deer City, I saw your tomb.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are right, the former Jiang Xiaohan is dead, and now I have a new life.” The woman sweetly giggled, an indescribably seductive and flirtatious expression on her face, but she paid no attention to what Ye Qingyu had said. With a shrug of her shoulder she said, “Everything is in the past, let it go with the wind, let it become the past.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This woman, who was very close with Ye Qingyu since childhood, and who could be regarded as his friend, was Jiang Xiaohan who had vanished during the Battle of the Light Palace. Ye Qingyu had seen her tombstone in Deer City and had really thought that she was dead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It never crossed his mind that he would meet her again in the Nine Serenities Palace of the Desert Brute Race imperial city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But your parents are still grieving for you every day. They definitely will be very happy if they know that you are still alive,” Ye Qingyu looked at Jiang Xiaohan who was many times more beautiful than the former Jiang Xiaohan from White Deer Academy and said in a serious voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since they gave birth to me, grief is what parents should bear,” Jiang Xiaohan said in an indifferent tone, as though she did not care the slightest about her biological parents. “Let them treat it as if I had died and had ended my life in an ordinary way. Is that not better... But brother Qingyu, are you really not curious at all, why I am here?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu shook his head, “Not particularly curious. I just feel very regretful.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Jiang Xiaohan's eyes flickered, “Why does brother Qingyu feel regretful?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Because after the Battle of the Light Palace, you have been given the opportunity to live. I hoped that the person who appeared in this Nine Serenities Palace today would not be you.” Ye Qingyu's expression was full of infinite regret. “Is Brute King Shi Potian still alive?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Xiaohan was taken aback for a moment, then the charming expression on her face faded, and instantly a cold frosty colour emerged on her face. “So, you found out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I originally didn't notice, but now I know.” Ye Qingyu's complexion was as usual, explaining, “There must be more than three of the awakened Snow Ground Ancient Demons that I have captured, and the number of old sect monsters that have awakened are not only the two that are in the hands of the Snow Ground Demon Race. The Sky Demon ancestor, although he had planned so many things, were all ruined by me. But he has yet to give a reaction. These days, I have been waiting for the counterattack from these demons and monsters, but Heaven Wasteland Domain have always remained calm and peaceful. Although I am confident in my own strength, I don’t think that the old monsters have disappeared because of their fear of me. It is obvious that they are planning an even more elaborate operation, are preparing to launch a thunderous blow. The Desert Brute Race is the last battle of my tour inspection, but today I suddenly received a letter from the Brute King Shi Potian. I found it strange. Even if the Desert Brute Race would eventually choose to surrender to the Snow Empire, they should not be so actively enthusiastic. The content of the letter seemed like they were afraid that I would not be going to the Desert Brute Race imperial court. I knew it was strange at the time, but when I came to the Long Life State, and saw the magnificent hidden underground city, and then faced the Nine Serenities Palace, I realiaed that there was nothing more appropriate for those monsters to do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Xiaohan looked at Ye Qingyu, not knowing what to say for a good while, “You... indeed are as clever as ever, but it is a pity that you walked in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu no longer pursued this issue, and asked, “Desert Brute King Shi Baotian, is he still alive or not?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alive or not, it does it matter.” Jiang Xiaohan smiled. “Do you think you can save him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu, upon seeing this, no longer question further. “Since we were childhood acquaintances, I'll give you a chance. You leave here now and all the things that had happened, I won't pursue any further. Go back to Deer City and reunite with your parents.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Xiaohan was surprised for a moment, before an unprecedented anger came over her matched beautiful face. This anger instantly turned into a wild laughter, “Haha, hahaha, my brother Qingyu, you are... Ha, are you kidding me? You are giving me a chance? Giving me what chance?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sharp laughter, in the end, sounded a bit like a broken voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expression that she looked at Ye Qingyu with was full of contempt and ridicule, and even tears of laughter overflowed her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And a powerful force, following the laughter, permeated out from her body, reaching the sixth step of the Heaven Ascension boundary in a flash. The flow of air fluctuated like a raging wave in the Nine Serenities Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was obvious that over the past year, Jiang Xiaohan's martial arts had improved at an unbelievable speed, and was much stronger than many old martial arts monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now tell me, what kind of chance are you going to give me?” She coldly grinned, looking at Ye Qingyu. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The chance to live.” Ye Qingyu did not have the slightest anger on his face, nor shock from the powerful strength that Jiang Xiaohan had revealed. Instead he asked again with an incomparably calm face. “I did not know you were involved in the Battle of the Light City, and I also do not know what happened to you later, but I still hope that you can turn back. Heaven Wasteland Domain is now very chaotic, why do you have to associate yourself with a group of old monsters who crawled out of the grave and bring chaos to the world?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But opposite him, the look of contempt and ridicule in Jiang Xiaohan's eyes was clearer and more intense than before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She suddenly lifted her chin and her slender swan-like neck, and sneered, “Haha, ridiculous. Ye Qingyu, do you really think that because I address you as brother Qingyu, and you can lecture me? Haha, you are still as before, conceited and ridiculous. That’s right, you have been patrolling the world these days, and are as invincible as the God of War, and even the Snow Ground Demon Court and White Mountain Black Waters Brute Race have been pressured to surrender from your strength. Do you think that such a deed has surpass what all others before you have done? Do you think that you are invincible, and those who obey you will thrive and those who oppose you will perish?”&nbsp;</span></p>

Unfortunately, you’ve had your opportunity, allowing you to move unhindered across Heaven Wasteland, but I also have my destiny, which far surpasses yours, allowing me to detach myself from Heaven Wasteland. The you now, do you know what you are like now?”&nbsp;</span></p>

You think Heaven Wasteland Domain is very big, but among the great wide world it is like a grain of sand, your efforts and achievements these days, in the eyes of the real important people, are just a joke.”</span></p>
