We saw that you were working hard and training in isolation. But don't be too strict on yourself and have such high requirements. A certain level of relaxation can challenge your state."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye Qingyu turned his gaze away from the distance. "I know everyone's good intentions. They seem like they are teasing me, but in truth they are helping me optimize my mood and state, to prevent me from feeling too much pressure... but, do you really think that I feel such great pressure?" Ye Qingyu smiled. "It is only a Chen Shaohua. If I can defeat him once, I can defeat him a second time. Even if the Greater One Sect gives a divine sect tool to him, this does not represent that they can win back the thing they need.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The sunlight shone from the door outside, landing on Ye Qingyu's face.</span></p>

He even had to face some of the alliance friends of the Greater One Sect, such as the Southern Palace family as well as the Sky Demon Palace. These were all top level powers. That's why he must make full preparations. There must not be any errors, because if there was a mistake at all, it not only would cause Yu Xiaoxing to fall into danger, it was even possible it would plunge the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain into chaos.</span></p>

It was originally quiet and serene, and the building that they belonged to was simple and minimalistic. Even some low level disciples of the Greater One Sect did not wish to stay here. But in these days, there were continuously people coming here, filling it up. They were all people of some small or infamous sects. The originally serene back peak was no longer quiet.</span></p>

But when that drop of Lightning Serum was ingested into his mouth, in an instant there were thousands of lightning arcs exploding throughout his entire body. The terrifying power of lightning that had not been tamed yet was wildly destroying and tormenting his fleshly body. It was like little blades running throughout his inner organs, cutting apart every inch of his body, or like tens of thousands of blood-thirsty ants devouring and biting apart his flesh. This type of pain really was difficult to endure unless one had great will and determination.</span></p>

He was cultivating in the [Ultimate Lightning Enlightenment], absorbing and transforming this droplet of Lightning Serum into power he could use. Especially the fragmented and scattered lightning laws contained within the Lightning Serum; this was the true essence of power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Lightning Serum was something that the Lightning Emperor had refined in the past. It contained the will and Dao of Lightning that the Lightning Emperor had comprehended in the past, and this was something that Ye Qingyu cared about extremely.</span></p>

There was a violet lightning curling around him. It formed a small lightning realm, three meters around his body.</span></p>

This further increased the effect of the body refinement.</span></p>

The previous lighting power that was as wild and as powerful as a dragon, had transformed into the gentleness and warmth of spring wind. It was like a warm stream, running throughout his limbs and bodies. It was as if every cell in his body contained the power of lightning.</span></p>

It would once again return to its fresh red colour. Then this would represent his mastery of the power of lightning reaching a high level. This was equal to the power of the Lightning Emperor before he had completely formed his path, before he had received the power of lighting from the heavens. In the aspect of giving information to Ye Qingyu, the Old Fish was extremely reliable. He told everything that he knew, without holding anything back to Ye Qingyu.</span></p>

It was like a thunderbolt solidifying the moment it exploded in the air, as if it was casually drawn from a child that did not even know how to write. It was a faint violet colour that was above the bones. It was extremely unclear, and if one did not closely examine himself, one would not be able to discover this at all. Looking at it, it seemed rough and simple. At this period in time, Ye Qingyu could not sense just what sort of use this lightning mark had.&nbsp;</span></p>

The only bones that had this faint lightning bolt mark appearing was only some main important bones in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; After finishing his inner vision, Ye Qingyu slowly opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He extended his hand, his five fingers spreading wide.</span></p>

It transformed into the shape of different tools, appearing extremely lifelike. It was like violet-coloured sprites that danced between Ye Qingyu’s fingers under his control. It seemed cute and obedient, as if it was a part of Ye Qingyu's own will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "My control over the power of lighting had increased multiple times compared to a few days ago."</span></p>

The violet colour became more and more concentrated, ultimately transforming into a throbbing purple flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; This violet flame followed along his palm and his arm, and spread around Ye Qingyu's entire body in the blink of an eye, like he was being burned up. His entire person was being surrounded by the violet-coloured light, and this power of electricity transformed into the appearance of armour. Although it was not exceedingly clear, but compared to the faint violet mist that was as thin as paper around his body in the battle against Chen Shaohua that day in the Enlightenment Tea Party, it was already many many times stronger.</span></p>

But even this half finished product is enough to easily receive the strike of the [White Lotus Sword Strike] from Chen Shaohua's White Lotus Sword."</span></p>
