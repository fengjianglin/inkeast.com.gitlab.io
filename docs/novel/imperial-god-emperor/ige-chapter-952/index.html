 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was already completely resigned to never seeing the [Divine Sword of the South] again. Unexpectedly, at the most impossible time, it would be the same benefactor who rescued him the last time to bring the [Divine Sword of the South] right up to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a bout of immense excitement and shock, he inhaled a deep breath and said, “Do you know what the [Divine Sword of the South] means?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was shocked to see that Ge Ming did not take hold of the sword immediately. He answered, “It’s a sword to me, but perhaps it means more to you. When I was in the ancient fiendgod city of the 18th district, I saw a Seven Fingers Race ancestor sitting cross-legged with this sword placed across his knees. I’d wanted to return this sword to you after leaving the 18th district but was unfortunately unable to find you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you really returning it to me just like that?” Ge Ming looked at Ye Qingyu with bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The latter nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know? With this sword in hand, I can slay a pinnacle Great Saint.” Ge Ming’s bright eyes seemed to be observing Ye Qingyu’s reaction. “This sword was also the reason why my race was massacred by an enemy. It’s said to conceal the secret of becoming a martial emperor… Now that you know these, are you still going to return this sword to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ge Ming gave a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief hesitation, he seemed to make a huge decision, saying, “The Seven Fingers Race has already become history and will never recover. I’m also already past my peak and probably won’t be able to take revenge in this life. Until now, I still don’t even know for sure who massacred my race. Since leaving the Black Demon Abyss, I’ve thought long and hard about this, and eventually decided to drop past grievances. I don’t want Shui Xiu to live a life of sword, blood, and constant anxiety, and would rather she have a peaceful life… If I was offered this sword a year ago, I would definitely receive it without hesitation, and might even have used all kinds of unscrupulous means to take it from you if you were unwilling to hand it over. But now… sigh, my heart has changed such that even a sharper sword would be as appealing as a blunt knife to me, and this sword would thus be wasted in my possession. Since Heaven has allowed it to fall into your hands, perhaps you should keep it. At least there’s a chance for it to regain its former glory this way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was astonished to hear this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had seen Ge Ming’s strength and knew that it was at the low-level Immortal Step realm, and even if it had skyrocketed recently, it could not have attained the Saint realm. Thus, for the latter to so confidently claim that he would be able to slay a pinnacle Great Saint with the [Divine Sword of the South] in hand was a clear indication of how terrifying the sword was, even if it should turn out to not actually contain the secret of becoming a martial emperor. It was certainly comparable to a sub-emperor weapon if not an emperor weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been a year since the sword fell into his hands. During this time, he had examined it but did not realize that it contained such power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nevertheless, this sword was the most valuable treasure of the Seven Fingers Race after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without exception, any such race treasure would have a blood relation to its race, and as a result, its full power most likely could not be exerted when it was in his hands. For instance, the [Dragonblood Halberd] of the Dragonblood Dynasty, too, needed to be worked up using the lineage force of the Dragon Human Race for its full power to be brought into play. As such, it was a significant waste of its power for it to remain in his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, he was slightly touched during the moment when Ge Ming offered to let him keep the sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, by the next moment, he had thought through everything clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, of course, was the fact that he had made a promise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, he quickly refused the offer and shook his head firmly, saying, “The sword should go to its rightful owner. When I was in the 18th district, I promised that ancestor to hand this sword to the descendants of the Seven Fingers Race. You can give it to Shui Xiu if you don’t want it. She should be allowed to decide for herself the kind of life she wants. Besides, I believe that it would be impossible for you to conceal your identity forever, given that you’re perpetually wanted by the Alliance of Domains.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ge Ming was stumped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at Ye Qingyu with unprecedented astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silence ensued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No wonder you would become the third deputy of the Human Race.” After a long period of silence, Ge Ming seemed to have gained some inspiration, and said with a serious countenance, “Hoho, I suddenly feel that the countless blows and defeats I’ve suffered over many years of fighting has somewhat dampened my lofty sentiments and aspirations of old, causing me to become despondent… Alright, the Seven Fingers Race hereby owes you a tremendous favor. I shall keep the [Divine Sword of the South] and will never forget your acts of kindness. Should a female emperor called Shui Xiu ever rise up in the future, my race will definitely lend a hand to the Human Race.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, he took hold of the [Divine Sword of the South].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After paying Ye Qingyu a respectful salute, his figure flashed and vanished on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ge Ming’s sudden outpouring of heroic spirit revealed that he intended to use the [Divine Sword of the South] to train Shui Xiu to become a female emperor. Although such will was certainly a good thing, it was not so easy to groom a martial emperor even if the sword indeed contained a secret technique of becoming one. Every martial emperor, past and present, was a generational being on whom was gathered the luck of the universe, and who possessed the willpower and mind to go through millions of ordeals before becoming able to bear the mandate of Heaven. A true martial emperor was not someone who could be groomed just by using a sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Ye Qingyu had seen Shui Xiu’s talents and endowments, and knew that they were absolutely of the highest order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps, there’ll be a female expert called Shui Xiu from the Seven Fingers Race among the experts of the Vast Thousand Domains one day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu turned and left the South Facing Inn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that Ge Ming would not be back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He also felt it unnecessary to go find Shui Xiu, whom he would probably only see again after a very long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he did not expect that the rise of the Seven Fingers Race would be a lot faster than he anticipated.</span></p>
