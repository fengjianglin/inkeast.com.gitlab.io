 <p>A face that was extremely handsome.</p>
 <p>This was the first evaluation Qiu Fenghan made towards Ye Qingyu. On this face that had a smile, there was a brightness and intimateness that made one easily have good impression about. In this faint smile, there was a sense of the sunlight in it, clean and bright, without any impurity.</p>
 <p>[War God]?</p>
 <p>Qiu Fenghan could be sure she had never heard of this name before.</p>
 <p>She looked at the surrounding environment that was still enshrouded by the silver mist. Thinking for a bit, her expression suddenly became tense, "Zhao Yun? Where are the others?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu took a deep breath in. "Are you talking about the young officer following beside you? He was unfortunate. To save you, he was struck from the fifth floor of the restaurant. By the time we discovered this, he already could not be saved...”</p>
 <p>As Ye Qingyu spoke, he took back some of the silver mist covering them.</p>
 <p>Qiu Fenghan could see the air clearing up in front of her. Carefully examining the scene, she discovered she was on a high speed formation flying carriage. All the lights from all sorts of architecture flitted past her, and the stars in the sky twinkled. They were no longer within the restaurant...</p>
 <p>Apart from the handsome youth who referred to himself as [War God] on the flying formation carriage, there were also tens of other young men that had excited expressions discussing something.</p>
 <p>The fellow that was as muscular as a gorilla was namely the genius deputy commander of the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] army. This fellow seemed even stronger than when she had last seen him as he departed from the army. His expression was also extremely rich, as if he had just returned from a great victory in the battlefield. His great laughter as his saliva flew everywhere, such an expression was something that Qiu Fenghan was deeply familiar with!</p>
 <p>"Head Qiu, are you alright?" Zhang Lei turned around to see Qiu Fenghan who was wearing a male style robe. Delighted, his voice was like rumbling thunder, filled with care and happiness.</p>
 <p>This brute still had such a loud voice and his brain was still filled with muscles.</p>
 <p>Qiu Fenghan bit her teeth.</p>
 <p>Hearing the shout of [Avalanche], the heads of all the young experts turned around.</p>
 <p>Although she was a female expert amidst the army, she was wearing the robe of a strange man and she was near naked below the robe. it caused Qiu Fenghan to feel deeply uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>But at this time, she could be sure, she had been saved.</p>
 <p>Without the need for Qiu Fenghan to ask, Zhang Lei and his comrades largely recounted everything that had happened today. Especially the scene where Ye Qingyu fought the [Purple Eye] Du Heng alone, the tone of these young experts could not help but grow excited, and had admiration and worship towards Ye Qingyu as they told the tale.</p>
 <p>Qiu Fenghan gave a glance at Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>The Ye Qingyu right now had long changed into a new white-coloured robe. Although one was not able to see any trace of blood, but Qiu Fenghan could still faintly sense the stench of blood. It was unknown whether this was just her mistaken sensation.</p>
 <p>Thinking that this youth, in such a desperate situation, did not retreat and directly defeated [Purple Eye] Du Heng who was ranked 99th in the [Heavenly Officer List] saved her from a bloody asura hell, and that she had injured him as repayment...</p>
 <p>Such a battle record for someone so young. No wonder he was so proud, to call himself [War God]. He definitely had the requirements to be proud.</p>
 <p>The fame and status of [Purple Eye] Du Heng, was something that Qiu Fenghan clearly knew. These days, the reason why she was so apprehensive was not because she was afraid of Young Master Du. it was because of the brother behind Young Master Du, who was really terrifying.</p>
 <p>But Qiu Fenghan did not know, that the so called [War God] was an interim title given by the military department. It was not of Ye Qingyu's choosing.</p>
 <p>But she knew that tonight, without the so called [War God] defeating that person, without the crowd of young experts and Zhang Lei acting honourably and not retreating, she would definitely have been defiled by Young Master Du. She could also have been something to blackmail the entire [Whip of the Thunder Deity] with, causing the entire army to be humiliated.</p>
 <p>If it was like so, then her life was not worth living.</p>
 <p>"Thank you."</p>
 <p>Qiu Fenghan clasped her hands as she expressed her thanks to the young experts.</p>
 <p>Ordering her thoughts, she demonstrated the toughness and training as a female officer. She turned her head towards Ye Qingyu. "To think I have accidentally caused you injury. I am deeply sorry for this, please forgive me."</p>
 <p>"This is a minor matter." Ye Qingyu smiled.</p>
 <p>As someone also originating from the military, Ye Qingyu also had good will towards this flower of the army. From his perspective, this Qiu Fenghan who came from a military background, was far more excellent than the female disciples of the sects like Nan Hua. He was able to see a sense of responsibility in this female expert towards her own country and race.</p>
 <p>"No matter what, I, Qiu Fenghan, will remember this debt." The female head officer stubbornly expressed her gratitude. "I will definitely report everything that had happened today to my army and the military department. If there are any consequences, I will definitely bear anything and I will definitely repay the debt you have done for me. Right now, I urgently need to return to the camp of the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] within the capital, to prevent my superior from being worried. As for the corpse of military officer Zhao, I hope I will be able to bring it back... if it is convenient, could you stop at the next sentry post?"</p>
 <p>Qiu Fenghan was an extremely intelligent girl.</p>
 <p>She instantly realized that the matter tonight was not just the trap Young Master Du had set for her because he desired her beauty. This was a matter that possibility had something to do with the hidden conflicts of several large hidden forces of the Empire, even the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] army might be dragged into it. Therefore, the first thing she had to do was to return to the residence of the army in the capital, and carefully plan out her next actions</p>
 <p>The gazes of everyone turned towards Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Without knowing when, Ye Qingyu had evidently become the leader of all the young experts</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked at the fair faced female officer with a trace of heroic spirit that was rarely seen within a woman. Nodding his head, "Of course you can. Officer Zhao was originally someone belonging to the [Whipof the Thunder Deity] army, so you can of course bring his body away. But for your safety... [Avalanche], accompany head officer Qiu back, I will ask for a leave of absence from the instructor."</p>
 <p>"Yes."</p>
 <p>[Avalanche] accepted very crisply.</p>
 <p>Qiu Fenghan did not have any objections to such an arrangement.</p>
 <p>After all, [Avalanche] Zhang Lei had once been someone belonging to the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] army, and they were familiar with each other. They did not have to be wary of anything.</p>
 <p>The flying formation carriage very quickly halted at the next post in front of them.</p>
 <p>After Qiu Fenghan and the others left, the young experts continued on their way.</p>
 <p>After an hour, they returned to the great building of the military department.</p>
 <p>they originally wanted to experience the wealth and glory of the capital after the meal. But since such a matter happened, they did not have such a mood anymore.</p>
 <p>Under the night sky, the building of the military department towered high up alone.</p>
 <p>As expected, Bao Shinu as well as the battle technique instructor rushed out instantly. Seeing the figures of the young experts, they charged towards them.</p>
 <p>"You bunch of people, why have you went out drinking and caused such a huge disturbance... how is it? is everyone alright? En? Seventeen people? We're still missing one... [Avalanche]? There was concern and worry on Bao Shinu's face. "Where is he?"</p>
 <p>"Nothing could have happened to [Avalanche], right? The tone of the battle technique instructor changed, "There are so many people, he should be fine..."</p>
 <p>Very evidently, the two instructors had already received some sort of information. From their actions, it seemed that they had been rushing about everywhere trying to find the youths.</p>
 <p>The tone of the two instructors held an unconcealed concern, as well as a faint hint of reproach. However this reproach did not make the young experts feel lectured, but instead made them feel thankful.</p>
 <p>After all, the two instructors had only met briefly with the youths for thirty days. They were only following orders, and they had no private dealings with them. But the expressions and concern demonstrated by these two made the young experts feel warmth in their hearts.</p>
 <p>There was someone that went and largely recounted everything that had happened tonight.</p>
 <p>Hearing that everyone was fine, that [Avalanche] had only gone to accompany Qiu Fenghan, the two instructors finally rest assured. And after hearing of the battle during the night, that the [War God] was able to defeat [Purple Eye], the two instructors had disbelief and shock as they looked towards Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"First, go back. Originally, you had three days of relaxation. But after the battle tonight, half the capital will have been moved by your actions. You must hide within the military department for a while to evade the storm." Bao Shinu said with a smile as he escorted the youths back into the great building.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry. No matter how big the waves get from this matter, the Crown Prince will be able to bear it for you." The battle technique instructor slapped his chest and guaranteed. "Furthermore, this matter concerns the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] army. This is a good thing, it will help you share the pressure of the backlash."</p>
 <p>The young experts did not reply.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, they returned to the training camp on the fifty fifth floor.</p>
 <p>"Three days later, your new appointment will come." Bao Shinu looked at the young experts who were still in a state of excitement, adding, "It's not certain that everyone will be able to remain in the capital. But the Crown Prince will definitely compete to obtain the best position for you, that will be compatible with your wishes. Rest well for these few days."</p>
 <p>After arranging matters for them, the two instructors rose to leave.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu suddenly opened his mouth: "Do we have to remain in the training camp in the next three days? Is this an order, or advice?"</p>
 <p>Bao Shinu was taken aback, then smiled. "This is of course, our suggestion. If you have some matters you must attend to, then you can of course leave. But you had best prepare before leaving or have someone accompany you, to prevent any accidents.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded. "Fine, I know now. Thank you instructor."</p>
 <p>Bao Shinu and the battle technique instructor gave a meaningful glance at Ye Qingyu, then left quickly. It seemed like they had some matter they had to do urgently.</p>
 <p>The young experts returned to their own dormitories</p>
 <p>That night, there were still people that insisted on training and there were some people that went to sleep early. It was as if time had once again returned to that mad time a month ago.</p>
 <p>On the next day, Ye Qingyu left the great building of the military department early.</p>
 <p>At the entrance, Lin Baiyi welcomed Ye Qingyu. After a brief exchange of words, the two left together.</p>
 <p>For Ye Qingyu, within the capital, there were still many important things for him to do.</p>
