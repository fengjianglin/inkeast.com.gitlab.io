 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Shi thought to herself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, there were already burst of cheers in Matchless Blade City. All of the disciples of Matchless Blade City were trembling excitedly, the entire city had sunk into a crazy atmosphere. The people living in Matchless Blade City all saw the city as home and Qin Zhishui as God, and thus his powerful counterattack had ignited the blood of every citizen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Zhishui saluted the cheering crowd with a cupped fist, then turned into a stream of light, returning to Matchless Blade City residence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, brother Ye Qingyu,” Qin Zhishui said, and was about to give his thanks by bowing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu grasped his arm with a smile, “You and I are brothers, why say thank you, there is no need to be so polite. Let alone this is what I should do. It is because I came so late that brother Qin Zhishui got wounded and many martial artists of Heaven Wasteland Domain had died. If my guess is right, then Wen Fusheng's reason of doing this is because of me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The higher-ups of Matchless Blade City also came over to express their thanks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Shi also bowed respectfully, “Thank you for lending a hand, Matchless Blade City will not forget your kindness.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sister-in-law is too polite.” Ye Qingyu returned the bow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Zhishui and him were like-minded, addressed each others as brothers, and Qin Zhishui was a few years older than Ye Qingyu, so it was right that he called her sister-in-law. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when the experts of Matchless Blade City looked at Huang Shi again, the expression in their eyes had changed again. Previously when Qin Zhishui was seriously wounded, Matchless Blade City felt that once Qin Zhishui had died, logically speaking the Supreme Elder should be the one who would take over the city until Huang Shi gives birth to the child, and then that child would succeed to the throne. But Huang Shi was born from an ordinary background, not a martial arts family, nor an official family. She was just a girl from a small remote mountain village, but Qin Zhishui fell in love with the peasant woman and willfully married to her. Once Qin Zhishui had died, his prestige scattered. Then Huang Shi’s ending, although it would be better than that of Qin Hui of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, in that her life would not be in danger, but the position of City Lord would not fall onto Huang Shi's child.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now, since Ye Qingyu had called her sister-in-law, in the future even if Qin Zhishui really died, then nobody in Matchless Blade City would dare to do anything to Huang Shi and her child. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Heaven Wasteland Domain, within the empire, how many could make the invincible Palace Lord Ye Qingyu bow?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every word and action of an important person was mysterious. If anyone naively thought this was just a polite way to address her, then their brain had really rusted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, the experts, who came to watch the battle also came to Matchless Blade City residence to see Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although these people did not turn things around in the battle, it was undeniable that they were the tower of strength of the martial arts world of Heaven Wasteland Domain, the backbone of its martial arts, and famous experts who had made a name for themselves long ago. They all had a great influence in the martial arts world of Heaven Wasteland Domain, thus Matchless Blade City also dared not treat them with disrespect, and then came to ask Ye Qingyu if he wanted to see these people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course, the martial artists who could appear in Matchless Blade City today are all heroes of Heaven Wasteland Domain.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was suddenly a burst of cheers outside Matchless Blade City residence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What an honour would it be for martial artists of Heaven Wasteland Domain to meet the Lord of the Light Palace in person and have a glass of wine together?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They did not expect to have this opportunity today. Everyone was incredibly excited, even the venerable elders who rarely smiled or spoke were as excited as a child. While the young and vigorous young martial artists could not help but start dreaming that the Palace Lord may see potential in them and take them in as disciples.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The efficiency of Matchless Blade City was very high.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In less than an hour, the banquet was already arranged.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because there were far too many guests, the location of the banquet had to be outdoors. The guests were served food as they arrived. From the main hall of Matchless Blade City residence to the main street outside there was estimated to be tens of thousands of experts attending this banquet. Matchless Blade City welcomed everybody.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wine and food on the table were all delicacies. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young disciples of Matchless Blade City moved back and forth between the tables, serving up century-old spirit wine that even the core disciples of Matchless Blade City rarely drank a few sips of in one month. The dishes that were served were also cooked by the best chefs in the residence and prepared with the best ingredients, or were directly ordered from the most famous restaurants of Matchless Blade City, and delivered over at the fastest speed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past few years, Matchless Blade City had become the leader of the Heaven Wasteland martial world, incomparably bustling, and was second only to Snow capital. Therefore, the major restaurants in the city could also be said to be renowned in the empire. Ordinary martial artists that did not have a certain power and wealth would not eat or drink at these major restaurants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was no exaggeration to say that this time, Matchless Blade City really showed absolute sincerity, and had spent a large amount of money.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, in addition to the officials of Heaven Wasteland Domain, only Matchless Blade City could support such a grand banquet in such a short period of time. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This clearly showed that the power and wealth of Matchless Blade City had increased dramatically in these three or four years of time. Moreover, this time it was the strongest and most respected Lord of the Light Palace who borrowed the place to hold a banquet and more than three quarters of the martial artists of Heaven Wasteland Domain were in attendance. Thus Matchless Blade City naturally was incredibly generous. This scale was comparable to a Heaven Wasteland Domain martial arts meeting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And the core of this banquet was undoubtedly Ye Qingyu and Qin Zhishui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ye Qingyu appeared, all of the people at the banquet were stirred up. First there were cheers and cries of joy at the small square in front of the main hall, and then like a wave, the cheers spread far to the inside of the Matchless Blade City residence. The martial artists who could not see Ye Qingyu also knew what was happening, and were all stirred up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And Ye Qingyu also did not break his promise, carrying a barrel of wine in one hand and a glass in the other, he, accompanied by Qin Zhishui and other people, toasted everyone starting from the small square outside the main hall to the streets outside. Regardless of strength, there was no difference in treatment. Such a gesture made the already excited martial artists completely plunged into high spirits. The atmosphere outside and inside was incredibly joyous and the mood was buoyant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The martial artists of Heaven Wasteland Domain came to know a Ye Qingyu who was not the same as they had thought, and who was not the same as rumoured. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was said to be like a divine dragon from the Ninth Heaven, incomparably imposing and majestic. For many martial artists of Heaven Wasteland Domain he was a mysterious deity-like existence, but tonight the Ye Qingyu who appeared before them, although extraordinary handsome and graceful, there wasn't that distant majesty. On the contrary, he was like a hero of Jianghu, gulping down large bowls of wine and taking large bites of food. He seemed like an old friend, which instantly closed the distance between them. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“From tomorrow, I will be in Matchless Blade City, speaking about martial arts for three days, and then I will build an incomparable arsenal, where I will leave behind some ancient books and manuals. Any person who has contributed to Heaven Wasteland Domain can enter the arsenal to have a look through, regardless of race or age!” Ye Qingyu said towards the end of the banquet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The martial artists were all shaken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strongest person was going to speak about martial arts. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and there was going to be an arsenal of manuals. Given the strength of Palace Lord Ye Qingyu, the ancient books and manuals he had must be extraordinary. Moreover, anybody who had contributed to Heaven Wasteland Domain was allowed to have a look. This, for many experts without a strong enough foundation or had not received cultivation from a sect, was simply as good as a meat pie falling from the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was night and the entire Matchless Blade City was having a joyous time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, everything that had happened in Matchless Blade City spread out at a terrifying speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The banquet came to an end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu stayed at Matchless Blade City residence that night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Zhishui reminisced with Ye Qingyu until dawn. During the day Ye Qingyu had treated Qin Zhishui's internal wound, and completely restored his former cultivation base. While they were chatting Ye Qingyu chose a cultivation manual called [The Sword Will from the Heavenly Deities] from the hundreds of cultivation manuals in the [Infinite Arsenal] for Qin Zhishui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This cultivation technique was particularly suitable for those who practiced the sword, and once one reached the peak one would achieve the Great Saint realm. Among the hundreds of cultivation manuals in the [Infinite Arsenal] it was a superior cultivation technique and complemented well with the blade methods and skills of Matchless Blade City. Ye Qingyu had long prepared this for Qin Zhishui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, with this cultivation technique I can soar to the sky and in the future may have the opportunity to fight alongside brother Ye Qingyu,” Qin Zhishui exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking to back then, his strength was comparable to Ye Qingyu, and he had fought alongside Ye Qingyu in the suspected palace of the Formation Emperor Luosu and coordinated well with him in the Battle of Light City. Although Qin Zhishui had not said this out loud, he had set his goal to be able to fight alongside Ye Qingyu. Thus, over the past few years he had been cultivating painstakingly to achieve the strength he had today. In Heaven Wasteland Domain, he was considered as one of the top existences, but after fighting against Wen Fusheng he came to realize that the difference in strength between Ye Qingyu and him was already too great.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This feeling was very difficult to bear for Qin Zhishui. He hoped that he could help Ye Qingyu, rather than always letting Ye Qingyu help him.</span></p>
