They would wait till the Demon Race drained him of his yuan qi, vigor and spirit to a certain extent before they would step in and attack him in his weakened state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crowd immediately parted unanimously.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The many experts of the Demon Race's headquarters appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's sword radiance pointed toward the Demon Race expert who was at the front of the group.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Kill!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Demon Race expert shouted loudly as his demonic power burst forth. Five or six rays of splendor swirled around his body and he simultaneously activated six or seven Saint weapons. He held a relatively high position at the Demon Race headquarters and had come prepared today. The Saint weapons exuded an incredibly powerful force and he attacked with resolve and determination. He detonated two of those weapons, then quickly retreated. He didn't dare to face Ye Qingyu's attack head-on.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a flash of sword light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demon Race expert's head flew up into the air and the frightening sword will instantly destroyed all signs of life within his body.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his head rose up in the air, the final scene that his eyes reflected was of Ye Qingyu emerging from the destructive and fiery explosion. He had passed through this explosion like a gust of wind and this explosive force that was enough to immediately kill four to five Great Saints didn't even touch a strand of his hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could this be...</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He thought resentfully before he completely lost consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he got his first kill, he continued to charge forward mercilessly. His sword light swept across the crowd like a milky way from the Nine Heavens and instantly, the sky was filled with icy radiances that enveloped the remaining hundred or so Demon Race experts within.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Puff! Puff! Puff!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood light splattered everywhere.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, another three Demon Race experts were sent flying while blood gushed out of their mouths. Their bodies had been sliced into two by the terrifying sword will and it also destroyed their life force at once, so they were as good as dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Retreat!"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Damn! The formation, form the formation!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We have to go all out to kill him."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demon Race experts bellowed madly and they were suddenly thrown into disarray. All of them were influential characters who would attract attention the moment they stepped into Heaven Connect City and despite the numbers that were gathered, they were all unable to withstand Ye Qingyu's frenzied attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They used all kinds of divine and precious weapons.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They exerted all kinds of divine skills and mysterious techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demon qi rolled over in waves.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demonic qi shot everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, abundant demonic power that seemed to take on a solid state filled the entire mourning hall. The entire mourning hall would have collapsed at that moment without the protection of the ice formation.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rest of the experts from the various races continued to retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, no one wanted to be swept into this battle.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Ou Wuji and Wei Wubing immediately retreated at the first instance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the moment that they had been waiting for. They wanted Ye Qingyu and the Demon Race to have a fierce battle and hoped that both parties would battle so intensely that they would sustain injuries. Then, the rest of them would be able to benefit without having to do anything. As long as Ye Qingyu thoroughly became the enemy of the Demon Race, even if he killed all the Demon Race experts who were present today, he would definitely become an enemy of the entire Demon Race in the future and the Demon Race would not rest until he was dead. Then, he wouldn't be appointed as the spokesperson of the Human Race —— It was impossible for someone who had such deep enmity with the Demon Race to become the leader of the Human Race. Otherwise, this could mean war between the two races.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A barely perceptible smile danced on Wei Wubing's lips as he fanned his red-feathered fan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ou Wuji seemed extremely anxious and would occasionally pretend to throw in a word of warning but in reality, he was extremely excited.</span></p>

The Demon Race had assumed that by sending out such large numbers, it would be enough to handle Ye Qingyu. After all, it wasn't just the Demon Race headquarters who wanted to kill him today. Those who were present at the mourning hall were all also his enemies. However, they didn't expect that this would be the outcome of the battle. If Ye Qingyu had been at the losing end or if both sides had been evenly matched at the start of the battle, the other races and forces would have definitely joined the battle. Now... it was likely that none of the other races would attack rashly before the Demon Race forced Ye Qingyu to reveal all his trump cards since Ye Qingyu had shown that he was far too powerful. They had to consider the consequences.</span></p>

A Great Saint would be reduced to a shriveled up corpse if he completely activated a single Emperor weapon and it wasn't easy to control either. Second, the Emperor weapon would affect the fate of a race and it was so risky that no one could afford any mistakes.

However, let me leave you with a warning, this is your last chance... You should be well aware of your current predicament by this time, right?"</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was indeed clear that the Demon Race was at the losing end.</span></p>

He had heard clearly the words that this young man had said earlier and said contemptuously, "Come on, I'll give you the chance to attack so that you'll die without regrets... I don't give a damn about your background, or who is shielding you. The insulting comments you've made about Mister Ren Puyang earlier has sealed your death today."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sir, please stop," A guard who stood beside the young man stepped up worriedly and his peak Great Saint qi activity swirled around him as he shouted, "You shouldn't attack our Young Lord. He is a Human Race expert too and divine blood runs through his veins. He is of noble status, so you can't afford to offend him. Please retreat immediately."</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining guards hastily surrounded the young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had witnessed the earlier battle and saw how effortlessly Ye Qingyu had destroyed the fake Emperor formation of the Demon Race. They were now well aware of how powerful and cruel he could be and knew that he truly lived up to his title of the [Ice Sword Killing God], so they didn't think that the young man would be able to defeat him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Get lost. Do you think I'd fear him?" The young man reacted like a provoked lion as he said, "I possess an Emperor weapon that could crush him many times over. Ha ha, how dare garbage like you be so arrogant in front of me? I'm going to make him regret being born... Get lost, all of you. My master instructed you guys to protect me, not to defy my orders... Get lost!"</span></p>
