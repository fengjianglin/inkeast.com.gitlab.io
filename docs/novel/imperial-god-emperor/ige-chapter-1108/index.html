 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu did not pay much attention to the nameless Quasi-emperor’s later words. Instead, he focused his attention squarely on and was utterly astonished by the three mentioned names.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“[Drifting Cloud Emperor], [Sea Sand Emperor]… They also...” He looked at the Quasi-emperor with a terribly shocked expression. The [Longevity Emperor] alone had deeply astonished him, yet it turned out that two other Martial Emperors had nourished the tree too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, of these two Martial Emperors, one was part of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, while the other was a legendary, supreme Emperor of the Demon Race. Both were certainly beings who had amazed many generations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Look below the tree.” The Quasi-emperor directed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing this, Ye Qingyu understood what to do and operated the [Eyes of the Void] to look into the ground below the Quasi-emperor. Those purple eyes saw through the ground surface and spotted an energy layer, beneath which was a most astonishing sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Submerged in the soil beneath the ground was a giant human who was sitting cross-legged. His body was even bigger than that of the nameless Quasi-emperor, such that he brought to mind the legendary primeval giants. His skin had already turned into stone, and it was only his figure which could be vaguely made out. However, Ye Qingyu was absolutely certain that this was not a stone or elemental formation but the body of a supreme being.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Martial Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A real Martial Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was more shocking was that there were three similar giant bodies beside the stone-hardened body of this Martial Emperor. They, too, appeared to have turned into stone and were incomparable in size, such that they reached several thousand kilometers below the ground. Although they seemed to be three Fiendgod statues which had been buried beneath the ground, Ye Qingyu was able to sense a heart-palpitating and most terrifying aura emanating from each of their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They’re each the body of a Martial Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This should be the three pinnacle beings, namely the [Longevity Emperor], the [Drifting Cloud Emperor], and the [Sea Sand Emperor], mentioned by the nameless Quasi-emperor, I guess. The roots of the World Tree are visibly growing in their petrified bodies, while white-colored roots and branches have perforated their bodies and thus grow both in and out...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene was shocking like no other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon seeing it, Ye Qingyu completely believed the Quasi-emperor’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was because the evidence was right in his face, and the bodies of Martial Emperors were impossible to fake, after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had never imagined that the members of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors who were said to have perished or disappeared, as well as the peerlessly distinguished emperor of the Demon Race, would actually be here and had ended up like that. This was simply too terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why? Why did they do what they did?” he could not refrain from asking loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An invincible Quasi-emperor and three Martial Emperors who each had ruled an age had chosen to sacrifice themselves. Is the legendary power of darkness really so frightening that an alliance of three Martial Emperors cannot withstand it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because, they fully understood the truth about this world and knew how frightening the power of darkness is. Moreover, they’d lost too much in campaigns against the power of darkness and were unable to defeat it. As they understood the secret of the reincarnation of civilizations, they chose to sacrifice themselves in order to save the runic martial world of this epoch. They thus used their own flesh, blood, and foundation to nourish this World Tree.” The Quasi-emperor gave a long sigh and spoke in a tone of helplessness yet anticipation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu remained silent for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was, without a doubt, an absolutely terrible piece of news to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had thought that his present battle strength was sufficient for him to walk within the Dark Realm and solve many problems. However, it now appeared that he had been looking at the sky from the bottom of a well. He was certainly some way off from solving problems which even the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were unable to solve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How about them?” He pointed at the phantoms of the eight supreme Heaven’s pridelings standing at the periphery of the canopy. “Why did they come here? And how did they end up like that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These eight Heaven’s pridelings were vehement warriors who had resided in the [Guanlan Mountain Manor] before and thus understood a few secrets. They voluntarily killed themselves and entered a state of neither life nor death in order to protect this Netherworld plane. They also sacrificed their egos.” The Quasi-emperor sighed. “They were all heroes of great will and aspirations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu somewhat understood this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor of the Dragon Human Race once said that the Dragon Human Old Emperor and several preceding Dragon Human Emperors had killed themselves in order to slay the Ancient Dragon Human Emperor, and they thus entered a state of neither life nor death. Because their strength increased greatly as a result, they ultimately succeeded in one stroke to destroy the weapon used by the Ancient Dragon Human Emperor in the Dragon Human Race’s mausoleum. The eight supreme Heaven’s pridelings appeared to have used a similar secret technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They also chose to sacrifice themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their spirits remained in this Netherworld plane, serving as rangers who controlled the area. Only their bodies were left behind for their relatives in the physical world, but because they were spiritless, they appeared as though they had gone mad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When imparting the secret technique to them, I couldn’t refrain from preserving a wisp of spirit in their bodies so that they might have a chance of resurrection when the Netherworld plane has been developed to its fullest in the future.” The Quasi-emperor lamented compassionately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu appeared to be absorbed in thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Anyone who comes to this plane was fated to do so, and certainly possesses the necessary strength, luck, and style. You included,” the Quasi-emperor commented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Understanding something, Ye Qingyu looked at the Quasi-emperor and asked, “You don’t look in good shape. How much longer can you endure for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not too long,” the latter answered frankly. “I’ll soon enter a state of dead sleep just like the three Martial Emperors, and won’t be able to provide any more nourishment for this World Tree.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And so… it’ll be my turn, right?” Ye Qingyu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He believed that there was a reason why he came here and felt that he must have been secretly chosen. Like the Quasi-emperor had said, those who came here had to possess a certain competence, which was perhaps the competence of becoming nourishment for the World Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s possible that the Quasi-emperor had long taken notice of me in the [Guanlan Mountain Manor] and has been secretly observing me, and after confirming that I’m able to become the successor for this noble task, he opened up that densely-fogged channel and brought me here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor laughed upon hearing Ye Qingyu's words. “If I allow you to succeed me, you’ll have to use your body to nourish the World Tree, letting it implant its roots in your body and providing it with your own essence, blood, yuan qi, and origin power. Are you willing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m willing.” Ye Qingyu answered without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was no longer an issue of his level of personal awareness or the morality of self-sacrifice. Of course, Ye Qingyu did not wish to die like that – just like nobody else would. However, in everyone’s heart were certainly the people they wanted to protect and could not leave behind. It was for these people that he had to undertake this task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But not now.” He added. “I have a couple more things to resolve in the Vast Thousand Domains. You’ll have to wait for me to sever these worldly attachments if you want me to use my body to nourish the tree.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I believe you.” The Quasi-emperor laughed and nodded before adding, “However, you’re wrong. I brought you here not to replace me in nourishing the tree, but for some other matter instead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Some other matter?” Ye Qingyu was puzzled. “Please tell me what the matter is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor explained, “The World Tree has already reached its final nirvana. After absorbing the origin power of three Martial Emperors and myself, it has evolved countless times and mastered the most perfect method of evolution, such that it has grown to the point where it can change the war situation. Therefore, it no longer needs to be nourished, and will subsequently undergo a regrowth. This will be a highly primeval state of growth which is in accordance with the rhythm and method of the final evolution. It’ll take root and germinate just like an ordinary tree, and after it has regrown, any one of its leaves would naturally be able to inhibit the power of darkness. As for how to use the World Tree to defeat the darkness, you’ll find out in time… I hope that you can take over control of the Netherworld plane from now onward and protect the World Tree until it has regrown.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Protect the World Tree?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was a little dazed for some time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor’s expression became solemn as he looked at Ye Qingyu and continued, “The World Tree and the Netherworld plane complement each other. They’re the final hope for the runic martial epoch to defeat the darkness. The plan conceived by the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, as well as the most highly respected members of the myriad races, shall soon rest upon you. Make no mistake, you’re the chosen one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing this, Ye Qingyu immediately recalled what happened in the suspicious palace of the Formation Emperor Luoso. At that time, he was also called the chosen one. He thus wondered why the Quasi-emperor had also called him the same name on this day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I saw that you’re fateless, and besides, you’ve been cultivating the mental technique conceived by the most outstanding being of all time. Don’t worry, there’s no way I could’ve misjudged on this matter.” The Quasi-emperor smiled as he looked at Ye Qingyu's doubt-filled face. “You’ll naturally understand in time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something strange happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The giant World Tree suddenly swayed gently and gave off a strange burst of energy. Subsequently, as if incinerated by an invisible flame, it disappeared piecemeal among the void. In less than a few dozen breaths’ worth of time, this enormous tree had dissipated, as though it had been an illusion all along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sprinklings of brilliance gathered onto the body of the Quasi-emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tree roots which had ingrained in his body also disappeared, leaving behind a heavily perforated and broken body which was already fossilized and fused with the ground for the most part.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the brilliance gathered into a fist-sized spot of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor opened his mouth and puffed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the brilliance scattered, the spot of light became a plain and simple seed which contained immense vitality and resembled a wheat seed. A strange power circulated in two double-petaled embryos which seemed to contain a world within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor ordered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strange seed instantly turned into flowing light and entered Ye Qingyu's body before he could react.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The latter had been caught off guard this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ancestor...” he uttered in great shock.</span></p>
