 <p>269 - The number ten pavilion</p>
 <p>The cool breeze arrived made the water ripple slightly.</p>
 <p>Under the illumination of the golden morning sun, the bright moon lake at the centre of the Proud sky centre, seemed like it was golden liquid. There was a broken beauty about it.</p>
 <p>Within the large Proud sky centre, figures were already colliding against each other due to how people there were.</p>
 <p>There was still an hour left till the Proud sky centre was truly opened. When the appointed time came, and all those who invited came, then the Proud sky centre would become closed off. The army would send their elite to guard the surroundings of the Proud sky centre, so that those who were unrelated to this matter had no way of entering. This would ensure that this Martial meeting could continue properly.</p>
 <p>The locations of the large sects and financial organisation had already been set.</p>
 <p>In the most central part of the Bright Moon Lake, a water areana was erected. Tens of metres tall, it was made from formation metal. It flickered with a golden light. One could see the patterns of the metal along with the flickering of this light. The arena was in the shape of an octagon, without any railings whatsoever at the edges. The surface was so smooth that it was like a gigantic copper mirror, but it did not relfect the light. It really was incomparably strange.</p>
 <p>Surrounding the Bright Moon Lake, were the locations of all the top sects. They were all pavilions with excellents views. There were also the flying ship dock of the army, where formation flying ships could stay. Other than this, there were the seats of some smaller sects, financial organisation or other forces. The hierarchy of the seating positions was clear and distinct. At one glance, one could discern just who would sat at which position.</p>
 <p>At the most southern part of the Bright Moon Lake, it was the main seating area of the Martial Alliance that could accommodate a hundred or so people.</p>
 <p>There was the light of a formation array that emitted from this area. There were floating platforms that hovered twenty or so metres above the ground, white mist swirling about them. From far away, it seemed like a divine mist was shrouding them, emitting a feeling filled with mysteriousness and power. This was the seating area of those truly important people. Anyone who was able to seat in this area, respresetned a powerful martial power and an exceptional status. There were exceptional powers enough to make one shiver behind such figures.</p>
 <p>Time flowed by.</p>
 <p>The seating area of the surroundings of the Bright Moon Lake were already filled with people. There were also people who stood, waiting outside the seating area.</p>
 <p>Xiu!</p>
 <p>A ray of light shot through the area, landing in the number six Xian Pavilion at the main southern seating area.</p>
 <p>"It's the people from the Violet Seven stars sect." There were some people by the lake that let out a gasp: "Do you see, that white hair muscular old man, is the seventh elder of the Violet Seven stars sect, Zhang Buliang. The young man behind him is the young leader of the three Schools and Three sects, the [One Whip], Jing Qiming. “</p>
 <p>The shadow of a tree, the fame of a person.</p>
 <p>Many matters and people of the Jianghu, were not a secret to the public. Especially for exceptional martial experts that had already become famous, most people would know of their appearance. Largely, one would be able to recognise them if they met face to face. Furthermore, even if they did not recognise them, as long as they demonstrated some of their techniques, those with insight would definitely be able to tell just what sect they originated from.</p>
 <p>For people like the seventh elder Zhang Buliang and Jing Qiming, their status in Jianghu was akin to the status of Lu Zhaoge in the army. The vast majority of Jianghu people would be able to recognise them with one glance.</p>
 <p>The people of the Violet Seven stars sect arrived first.</p>
 <p>These two were situated in the number six Xian Pavilion.</p>
 <p>Everyone started talking amongst themselves.</p>
 <p>There were many young disciples that were incomparably excited, as if they had just seen their idol.</p>
 <p>In a world where martial power was everything, everyone admired powerful experts. This was a madness that came from their very bones, none was immune to it.</p>
 <p>Xiu!Xiu!Xiu!</p>
 <p>Another several rays of light broke through the air.</p>
 <p>These lights settled, landing in different Xian Pavilions and transforming into the figures of several people.</p>
 <p>"Quickly look, the person in the number seven Xian Pavilion, is the head of the disciplinary hall of the Setting sun and great river sect. His fist techniques are said to be invincible, Quan Jiulong. And the young man next to him wearing coarse clothing, is his eldest son. He is the most prodigious disciple of the younger generation of the Setting sun and great river sect....“</p>
 <p>"The Fourth Xian Pavilion holds the Tiger Saint child, Zhao Shanhe, as well is the Dragon saint child Zhao Woyun. Eh? It seems The Dragon tiger sect did not send any elders to accompany them, it looks like they have full confidence in the Dragon and Tiger Saint children."</p>
 <p>"According to the rumours, the relationship between the Dragon child and the Tiger child is not good. Look at the two, the distances between their seats are so great....."“</p>
 <p>“This Tiger child is really like the rumours, impulsive and unruly. In such an important meeting, to bring his two concubines to sit in the Xian Pavilion....."</p>
 <p>"There's only one person in the number eight Xian Pavilion?"</p>
 <p>"Who is it? It seems like he really young and handsome."</p>
 <p>"En, he should be the [Matchless Blade King] of the new generation, from the Matchless blade city, Qin Zhishui."</p>
 <p>There were all sorts of discussion occurring from all sorts of parties.</p>
 <p>According to the agreement with the army, there would not be anyone from the army appearing apart from those who were invited. However, the army controlled everything outside the Proud sky centre. Due to this reason, the majoirty of those that appeared here today were disciples from Jianghu. Seeing such scenes, they were all inexplicably moved.</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo and her father Song Jiannan, were also situated next to the Bright Moon Lake.</p>
 <p>Their position, was the seating area of the Hundred Herb.</p>
 <p>As one of the providers of the venue for this Martial Meeting, the seating area of the Hundred Herb hall was one of the best apart from the seating areas of the top forces. It could not be said to be cramped. Dugu Dixiu, the noble young master, also next to them. Their field of view was great, able to see the figures at the Xian pavilions clearly.</p>
 <p>In Song Jiannan's heart, he was inexplicably moved.</p>
 <p>He originally thought that the Song family was at the end of their road, but who would have thought there would be sudden light at the end.</p>
 <p>Even when the Song family was at it's peak, they would not have been able to appear at such an event. They would not be able to see so many legendary martial figures.....in that instant, Song Jiannan felt an unprecedented uplift in morale. He felt that their previous sufferings were trials that Heaven had sent in order to test them. The opportunity of the Song family, had finally arrived.</p>
 <p>Of course, Song Jiannan realised just how all this had come about.</p>
 <p>In his arms, he was holding onto that item.</p>
 <p>Just how should he use this item, just who should he present it to.....Song Jiannan was hesitant.</p>
 <p>The Song Qingluo next to him, stared nervously all around.</p>
 <p>If it were previous day, Song Qingluo would definitely be as excited as the people around her at being able to see the appearances of these great figures in the Xian Pavilion. But her brain right now was completely occupied with the matters that had occurred last evening. White Horse tower had been completely crushed by that gigantic foot in an instant. At that moment, Song Qingluo's heart became utterly worried.</p>
 <p>Her heart did not have even the slightest hint of excitement at arriving in the Proud sky centre. She was only hoping she would be able to see the figure of that white clothed youth.</p>
 <p>And even until this moment, Song Qingluo was not able to see that person.</p>
 <p>Seeing her anxiousness, Dugu Dixiu smiled slightly at her: "Is Miss Song worrying about the matters of Marquis Ye?"</p>
 <p>Dugu Dixiu was a famous noble young master. He came from a powerful family, and his manner was elegant and polite. He was extremely good looking, and could be counted as an experienced person with the ladies. He was skilled in reading others expression, especially the thoughts of women. He had long guessed what Song Qingluo's worries were, so he asked such a question.</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo let out a sigh, somewhat panicky but she still nodded her head reservedly.</p>
 <p>"Just what kind of person is the Marquis. He will naturally be fine, he should arrive very soon. Please rest assured Miss Song." Dugu Dixiu said in a very certain tone.</p>
 <p>"Truly?" The dark clouds on Song Qingluo's face disappeared, her entire person becoming more lively.</p>
 <p>There was a flicker of surprise that flashed by in Dugu Dixiu's eyes. He had seen many beautiful girls, but the girl who came from a small merchant company in front of him, had a special beauty that was hard to describe using words. It caused his heart to involuntary skip a beat, but Dugu Dixiu naturally would not have any thoughts about Song Qingluo. Because he knew very clearly, any girl that had anything to do with Ye Qingyu, was not something he could touch.</p>
 <p>"Please rest assured Miss Song." Dugu Dixiu nodded his head. "Yesterday, Marquis Ye was with my grandfather discussing the Dao and sipping tea."</p>
 <p>Song Qingluo heart could finally rest.</p>
 <p>The bright and beautiful sunlight landed on this young girl whose mood had finally improved. There was a golden glimmer that appeared on her smooth and white skin, emitting a radiance that moved one's heart. Dugu Dixiu was once again surprised, not daring to look again, diverting his eyes to somewhere else.</p>
 <p>Xiu!Xiu!Xiu!</p>
 <p>There was more rays of light flickering through the sky.</p>
 <p>The appointed time was about to come.</p>
 <p>The main seating area, the Xian Pavilions, nearly all had figures seating in it.</p>
 <p>The Wang Yifeng of the Deer cauldron sect, the Li Qiushui of the Crepe Myrtle, the Dugu Tianxin of the Dugu financial organisation.....</p>
 <p>All those important figures, had all appeared.</p>
 <p>Dugu Dixiu loved to enjoy himself. He did not have a strong ambition. Therefore he naturally did not have a chance to sit with his grandfather in the Xian Pavilion. Dugu Tianxin was mature for his age, and did matters competently. Naturally, he was raised with the intention of making him the next head of family. At this time, Dugu Quan naturally had to give his grandson some chance to show his face.</p>
 <p>Dong---!</p>
 <p>The bell sounded.</p>
 <p>The time had arrived.</p>
 <p>The martial meeting officially began.</p>
 <p>Everyone looked towards the direction of the Xian Pavilions. Without knowing when, there were already figures at the number one Xian Pavilion. A figure that was completely enshrouded by silver mist sat at the number one Xian Pavilion, along with three other people.</p>
 <p>A middle aged lean scholar.</p>
 <p>A scholar's boy with a clear and fair face looking to be around fourteen or fifteen.</p>
 <p>A young military officer wearing full armour. He had a serious face, his hands clasped behind his back in respect as he stood next to the person shrouded with silver mist.</p>
 <p>Only the number ten pavilion was completely empty, with no figure to be seen.</p>
 <p>"This is the Xian Pavilion prepared for [The Leaf of Youyan], Ye Qingyu."</p>
 <p>"Why is there no one?"</p>
 <p>"Haha, could it be that the giant foot that descended from the heavens, really killed [The Leaf of Youyan]?"</p>
 <p>All of the people from the Jianghu looked towards the number ten Xian Pavilion.</p>
 <p>The people of the Jianghu naturally had an entirely different opinion of Ye Qingyu compared to the soldiers of Youyan army as well as the civilians of Youyan Pass. The news that Ye Qingyu had used such forceful methods to supress the people of the Jianhu had long spread throughout the sects. They naturally would not have any goodwill towards such a tyrannical person from the military. Ye Qingyu was able to destroy the powerful Xuan sect with just a thought, who could be certain that they would not be the next target he killed?</p>
 <p>From the perspective of the Jianghu people, if Ye Qingyu perished, than this would one less threat to them, one less monster they had to deal with.</p>
 <p>When the giant foot descended from the heavens, and crushed the White Horse tower into powder, it was unknown just how many people from the sects were dancing in joy.</p>
 <p>Today, seeing that Ye Qingyu still had not appeared yet, they grew even more excited.</p>
 <p>Dong!Dong!</p>
 <p>Dong!Dong!</p>
 <p>The bell rang out three times, vibrating throughout.</p>
 <p>The number ten Xian Pavilion was still empty.</p>
 <p>In the number two Xian Pavilion, the elder of the Crepe Myrtle sect next to Li Qiushui stood up.</p>
 <p>Ding Li was well known hundreds of years ago. He was one of the greats of Crepe Myrtle sect, his strength deep and unfathomable. His status was extremely high amongst the sects, he was an elder like existence. Before the meeting began, all parties had nominated him to be the conductor of this great meeting. This was because no matter in strength or status, he could convince the masses.</p>
 <p>Ding Li smiled, clasping his hands to the surroundings. He was about to speak.</p>
 <p>"Wait."</p>
 <p>A voice, suddenly sounded out from the number one Xian Pavilion.</p>
