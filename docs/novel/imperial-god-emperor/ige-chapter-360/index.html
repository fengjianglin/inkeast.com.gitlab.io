 <p>360 - Who wants to fight again?</p>
 <p>This time, the person to jump onto the arena was [Flowing Light].</p>
 <p>He was the lazy handsome youth with long pale yellow hair.</p>
 <p>Ten days ago, the strength of [Flowing Light] could be compared to [Shadow]. But after the battle [Shadow] had with Ye Qingyu, not only did he erase the problem of falling into demonic fire, [Shadow's] strength had also entered into the next level. Ever since then, [Flowing Light] no longer had any method of fighting against [Shadow] on the [Dragon Tiger List] and had been forced into number three.</p>
 <p>Seeing that [Avalanche] had also broken through his bottleneck after fighting with [War God], how could he not feel impatient?</p>
 <p>[Flowing Light] was clear in his heart that although he had fought and killed countless times in the army, he had long reached his limits. He no longer had any way of raising his strength by killing and fighting with the army. Only fighting against true experts could he activate his potential and go on to the next level.</p>
 <p>But to activate his hidden potential, he had to fight a top level expert. Where would he find one so easily?</p>
 <p>The [War God] in front of him was unquestionably the most suitable person.</p>
 <p>Therefore, after [Avalanche] left the arena, he instantly let out his challenge.</p>
 <p>His figure flickering, [Flowing Light] landed on the arena.</p>
 <p>"Please."</p>
 <p>"Please.”</p>
 <p>The two bowed to each other and the battle began at the next instant.</p>
 <p>The martial style of [Flowing Light] was the same as his name. His greatest strength was in his speed. The instant he acted, his figure was like flowing light with multiple figures, and no way of discerning which was his true figure. It caused one to be unable to see what moves he used, and they had no way of figuring out just where he was.</p>
 <p>With Ye Qingyu's vision, even he could only faintly see some shadows that flickered around him. He had no way of capturing his true body.</p>
 <p>"No wonder he is called [Flowing Light]. His speed is definitely at its extreme. Although his cultivation state is only half a step into the Bitter Sea stage, but his speed is so quick that even a Bitter Sea stream stage expert would have no way of comparing to him. This person's speed has already reached its extreme.“</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu held the [Beheading Wind] sword, not moving in the slightest.</p>
 <p>This time, the young experts the crown prince had chosen all had similar strength, but every one of them had an incomparable speciality. For example, [Shadow] was of the shadow attribute, [Avalanche] had divine strength and [Flowing Light] had the quickest speed. Others such as [Storm] and [Long River] must also have their specialities.</p>
 <p>Since his eyes could not capture him, Ye Qingyu closed his eyes.</p>
 <p>His consciousness spread out like the tide, encompassing everything in the arena, wanting to capture [Flowing Light]'s figure.</p>
 <p>Xiu!</p>
 <p>Accompanied by a sharp sound of something piercing through the air, a sharp feeling had already reached his face.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu struck out with his sword, blocking it.</p>
 <p>But [Beheading Wind] met with nothing.</p>
 <p>After [Flowing Light] had calculated his strike would have no way of achieving his aim, he rapidly retreated. He struck then retreated in one smooth move, not leaving even a shadow behind. Ye Qingyu's block had no way of touching the [Heavenly Projectile] in his hands.</p>
 <p>As his sword pierced air, Ye Qingyu's body once again stayed still.</p>
 <p>[Flowing Light]'s figure, became even faster.</p>
 <p>One was still while one was moving rapidly. This comparison was too acute.</p>
 <p>For many of the young experts below the arena, the majority of them could only see [War God] standing there like a sculpture. A faint yellow gust enveloped around him, and there would occasionally be a silver projectile that pierced through the air. Only then would Ye Qingyu move his sword, but everytime his sword moved, it had no way of touching [Flowing Light's] true body.</p>
 <p>"I really hate the method at which this person does battle. Soft and gentle, there's no way of striking him. Everytime I strike out, it is like hitting cotton floss or the air, this is enough to make me spit out blood!" [Avalanche] complained.</p>
 <p>The other young experts also had a similar feeling.</p>
 <p>In these past twenty days, there had been people who had sparred with [Flowing Light] so they understood.</p>
 <p>The reason that [Shadow] was able to defeat [Flowing Light] was because [Shadow] was also of the speed attribute. Furthermore, [Shadow's] cultivation techniques were was substituting for histrue body, causing his true body to be unable to be discerned. This counteracted [Flowing Light's] extreme speed of doing battle.</p>
 <p>At this time, many young experts focused their attention on the arena.</p>
 <p>Everyone wanted to know if the [War God], who would unquestionably remain number one on the [Dragon Tiger List] no matter what the time, just whether he would be able to break through the extreme speed of [Flowing Light].</p>
 <p>An hour very quickly passed just like that.</p>
 <p>Under the surveillance of everyone, Ye Qingyu maintained his still form. His sword would strike out one by one, but he had never touched [Flowing Light]. Even the [Heavenly Projectile] in his hands, he had not been able to touch.</p>
 <p>But the eyes of the two instructors and the other young experts grew brighter and brighter.</p>
 <p>Because everyone could see that [Flowing Light]'s speed had evidently lowered</p>
 <p>Such a lowering of speed did not mean that he lacked for stamina.</p>
 <p>It was because there was a strange field that appeared on the arena some unknown time ago. It caused [Flowing Light] to be stuck like he was in quicksand, his movements began to be restricted.</p>
 <p>At the same time when the [War God] struck out, the originally normal sword aura seemed to cause a strange sensation to be born in others. The sword that seemed to strike out without any guidance or movement seemed to have a profoundness of the Dao that was hard to describe using words.</p>
 <p>Finally.</p>
 <p>Ding!</p>
 <p>A light sound.</p>
 <p>The [Beheading Wind] sword finally touched the [Heavenly Projectile].</p>
 <p>[Flowing Light's] weapon finally could not retreat at the first instance. The great sword in Ye Qingyu's hand finally made contact with it.</p>
 <p>This was the first metallic clash that emitted since the battle begun.</p>
 <p>It was weak.</p>
 <p>But in the ears of everyone, it was even louder and more piercing than heavenly thunder.</p>
 <p>The next instant, Ye Qingyu, who had closed his eyes and used his consciousness to capture [Flowing Light], finally opened his eyes. The [Beheading Wind] sword in his hand that was only used for blocking, suddenly struck explosively. In the time of a spark, it cut towards empty space by the side.</p>
 <p>The instant the sword cut down, a faint figure appeared there.</p>
 <p>"What?”</p>
 <p>"He's been hit!"</p>
 <p>"[War God] has already seen through the secrets behind the body technique of [Flowing Light]. He has struck with his sword prematurely through the trajectory that [Flowing Light] will definitely pass though, so it seemed like [Flowing Light] went and struck the greatsword of his own initiative.“</p>
 <p>"The rhythm of [Flowing Light] has been disrupted."</p>
 <p>"[War God] really is unbeatable. To think he would use such a method to defeat [Flowing Light's] speed."</p>
 <p>"In truth, I feel that the true terrifying aspect of [War God] is not as such. In this entire hour, look at his movements. In truth, he has completely suppressed [Flowing Light's] speed. Every sword that Ye Qingyu struck out with, [Flowing Light] must make a response to. In truth, the person that was truly forced to respond was [Flowing Light]. Was there anyone who even saw [Flowing Light] even able to enter into a one inch area of [War God] after fighting for an entire hour?“</p>
 <p>The young experts discussed the fight in low voices.</p>
 <p>Compared to twenty days ago, everyone had become much more familiar with each other. They were all people with extraordinary talent, and their vision and judgment was extremely high. This series of discussions had penetrating insight.</p>
 <p>As they spoke, everything on the arena had already changed.</p>
 <p>The Ye Qingyu who was silent and did not move finally acted of his own initiative. His footsteps were slow, but every step he took, every sword strike he made, had an indescribableness about it. It was as if it had the power of foresight, that would strike the path that [Flowing Light] would definitely take.</p>
 <p>An even quicker speed would not be faster than foresight.</p>
 <p>This was an irrefutable truth.</p>
 <p>The complexion of [Flowing Light] greatly changed.</p>
 <p>The situation suddenly turned difficult.</p>
 <p>He originally felt that he was an extremely nimble fish, swimming freely in the ocean. But the surrounding ocean had turned into sand. His advantage had disappeared.</p>
 <p>[War God] struck sword after sword at him. The sword was not fast nor quick, but caused him to feel extremely pressed. His speed had no way of activating.</p>
 <p>"Why is it like this?"</p>
 <p>It seemed as if there was really flowing light in the brain of [Flowing Light]. He suddenly realized that the extreme speed that he had always pursued, when it reached a relative peak and he could not break through any further was not because this was the pinnacle of speed. It was because the meaning that he imposed on speed had always been too narrow and lacking from the beginning.</p>
 <p>"I understand."</p>
 <p>He loudly shouted, then retreated, suddenly stopping.</p>
 <p>There was mad delight on his face, the two [Heavenly Projectile]-like silver sprites jumping and leaping naturally around in his palm. There was a mad joy in his eyes as he looked at Ye Qingyu, "I understand, hahahaha, I understand. Thank you, [War God]. I will definitely repay the favour today, wahahaha..."</p>
 <p>Before he had finished.</p>
 <p>He disappeared, returning to the dormitory to comprehend such a flash of insight.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stood on the arena, still wanting to go further.</p>
 <p>With the [Beheading Wind] great sword in his hands, he had only begun to comprehend some of the mysteries behind the [Human King Sword Mantra]. He had used his most instinctive method to use the sword, to fight. It was only that the speed of [Flowing Light] had given him far too much pressure. Counterattacking under such pressure seemed to have really caused Ye Qingyu to have a flash of insight, interacting with a trace of meaning of the [Human King Sword Mantra].</p>
 <p>It was a pity that [Flowing Light] had already admitted his loss and left the arena.</p>
 <p>But a new opponent quickly came.</p>
 <p>"[Storm], please."</p>
 <p>The somewhat silent young man did not have a figure like [Avalanche], but he was also abnormally muscular. His muscles and skin were like boulders, filled with an explosive power that made one fear.</p>
 <p>The battle begun once again.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu once again immersed himself in comprehending the [Human King Sword Mantra].</p>
 <p>Storm had exhibited his strongest power. The reason he was called [Storm] was because there was the bloodline of ancient berserks running through his body. He could go berserk in battle, instantly causing his offensive and defensive power to multiply, and losing the ability to feel pain. He lost all fear and hesitation and turned into an intricate machine to do battle.</p>
 <p>But after an hour, he jumped off the arena of his own volition.</p>
 <p>Coming out of the berserk state, [Storm] was fatigued, but his eyes burned like the stars.</p>
 <p>This was the first time that he had forcefully been ejected from his berserk state before his time was up. This was the first time he could sense pressure and fear in his berserk state, and recovered a shred of his consciousness.</p>
 <p>From the information that he received from his ancient blood, this was a very good sign. This represented an increase in the explosive power of his bloodline.</p>
 <p>In reality, after [War God] battled with [Shadow], [Avalanche], [Flowing Light] and also [Storm], they all obtained a result they wanted.</p>
 <p>Such a result caused other young experts to not be able to bear it any longer. They all challenged Ye Qingyu one by one.</p>
 <p>Every young expert hoped to be able to break past their bottleneck from fighting [War God], to take the next step forward. This was even more attractive when all the cultivation techniques and resources were provided by the military department and Imperial family.</p>
