Perhaps something went his way today, and that's why he's in a good mood." Ye Qingyu casually remarked while roughly understanding what the white-robed divine guard meant. He could not help revealing a smile when he recalled Ren Puyang's self-disrespecting look in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's not because something went his way." Xiao Lin shook his head and looked at Ye Qingyu with a somewhat meaningful expression. After a brief pause, he stopped beating around the bush and got straight to the point, "I think he's happy because of you, brother Qingyu. Don't you know, Mr. Ren Puyang has an elegant nickname called [Ironface] in Heaven Connect City. He smiles very little, and would only feel in a better mood when meeting young human talents. Still, he has never smiled as many times as he did today when meeting you. He has to attend to myriad issues every day and is always up to his eyes in work, such that he would not spend more than thirty minutes even when receiving other powerful figures. Only you can stay for such a long time in his office."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Lin's intent was very obvious. This was an ingenious way of flattering Ye Qingyu and pointing out Ren Puyang's great regard for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu was somewhat astounded and shocked when he heard this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had earlier discerned Ren Puyang's regard for him - Ren Puyang himself had even mentioned training him and having high expectations. However, the guard's words gave him a point of comparison, allowing Ye Qingyu to find out that Mr. Ren Puyang's expectations of him were a lot higher than he had initially thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Perhaps he just happened to have some free time today." He laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hoho, His Excellency never has free time. I've served him for a hundred years and have never seen him been free for a moment. If not for his painstaking efforts to prop things up in Heaven Connect City, the place of the Human Race in many domains would've gone rotten by now." The guard sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being Ren Puyang's confidant, he had seen too many people and things while following beside Ren Puyang all these years, and was fully aware of Ren Puyang's pains. As he spoke, he betrayed his own heartache and distress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu looked rather surprisedly at Xiao Lin, who he had just gained a much better impression of. After a brief pause, he quipped, "As they say, severe illnesses have to be treated using strong remedies. One should have the heart of a bodhisattva and act like an asura. If something is rotten from its roots, then the roots have to be pulled out."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The latter's eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he had heard the ideas and aspirations of several other human talents he met and could tell that every one of them had great ambitions, none of them were in accord with Mr. Ren Puyang. Only Ye Qingyu's ideas were very similar to those of Mr. Ren Puyang in recent years, which were formed over several hundred years of watching the Human Race, experiencing hope and disappointment, and conducting reflection, investigation, and experimentation. Instead, at such a young age, Ye Qingyu already had agreeable ideas. No wonder Mr. Ren Puyang would permit himself to spend so much time with him and smiled so much more than usual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"These are fine words, Lord Ye Qingyu. It's just that having the heart of a bodhisattva while acting like an asura may result in too much killing, which would eventually incur some disapproval," he could not refrain from adding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll not be fazed even if opposed by ten million people." Ye Qingyu laughed faintly and spoke no more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Xiao Lin saw Ye Qingyu's expression, he knew that the latter was not joking and probably had his own plans already. Therefore, he too laughed and said nothing else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had already said what had to be said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Any more would be unnecessary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Xiao Lin dared not claim to have a complete read on Ren Puyang's thoughts, yet being the most capable bodyguard of this powerful juggernaut, he nevertheless could clearly spot the changes in the expression and tone of the latter, who had all along cherished talents greatly, after this emerging talent of the Human Race named Ye Qingyu appeared in the congress divine temple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was why he displayed a very polite attitude toward Ye Qingyu and Yu Xiaoxing and provided them with many reminders while guiding them in participating in the domain grading.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After traversing the path, the two arrived in front of the silver spatial formation splendor at the depths of the portal divine temple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Please enter, brother Qingyu."</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing in the doorway of the side hall's back door, Ye Qingyu paused momentarily and swept a cursory glance across, noticing that the side hall remained as bustling and boisterous as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the side hall, there were approximately more than three hundred half-partitioned seats, on every one of which sat a representative from one of various races and domains among the Vast Thousand Domains. Like the most crowded and popular restaurants in Heaven Connect City, this place never had an empty seat, and demand always outstripped supply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon close inspection, Ye Qingyu could see that some old faces had left while many new faces had arrived. For instance, the human sect master who made insulting remarks toward Qin Hui was nowhere in sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Evidently, during the time when Ye Qingyu was away, people were continually brought into the core divine temple from the side hall, while more representatives and leaders from various races entered the congress divine temple and were sent here to wait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he observed the bustling crowd of representatives who were awaiting the judgment of their destinies, he, for some unknown reason, suddenly had a very weird feeling - that although the people who can come here are each an extraordinary being of the Vast Thousand Domains, they ultimately can never be freed from the cage...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Accompanied by Xiao Lin, he entered the side hall and walked toward his earlier seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While passing by some seats, there would occasionally be a few human compatriots and representatives from friendly foreign races nodding a greeting at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quickly spotted the seats of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps.</span></p>

The smile on her face indicated that the empress was in a pretty good mood and vigorous vitality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smile involuntarily formed at the corner of his mouth as he walked over.</span></p>

A brilliance flickered in her eyes at once, and her voice could barely conceal her excitement. Evidently, she had received quite a number of good news when settling the handover procedures earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nodding, Ye Qingyu was about to say something to Yu Xiaoxing when he saw that Qin Hui and her son, both of whom were also seated, wore rather strange expressions on their faces. They cuddled together with their bodies drawn back, as if they wanted to hide behind the one-meter-tall partition, and revealed a hard-to-disguise look of fear and awe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu was taken aback.</span></p>
