 <p>As she finished her words, the voice of Aunt Han utterly disappeared.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu attempted to make contact several times more, but there was no reply.</p>
 <p>"She must have done it deliberately. She left out something at the end, to intentionally invoke my curiosity..."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was speechless.</p>
 <p>This Aunt Han, really seemed to like playing pranks.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu could clearly sense the good will of this Aunt Han.</p>
 <p>Without knowing why, in his subconscious, he trusted this white-clothed woman that he had only seen just once very much.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>On the way.</p>
 <p>The ship received layer after layer of inspection. After approximately one hour, they left the outer area of the ancestral land. This trip to the Temple of the Imperial family could be said to have temporarily ended.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu hurried to return to the great building of the military department. Because the promised three days had already passed, the new missions entrusted to the eighteen young experts by the military department should already have been distributed.</p>
 <p>It was unknown what sort of news Xing'er heard from the mouths of the golden armoured soldiers, but when she came out from the cabin of the airship, she seemed somewhat down, as if she was grumpy about something. She did not seem to want to speak, and Ye Qingyu, seeing this, did not go and incite this spoiled princess.</p>
 <p>Thankfully Xing'er did not forget the matter of sending Ye Qingyu back. The ship turned towards the direction of the military building, taking special care to give Ye Qingyu a lift.</p>
 <p>As they watched the military department building appear from far away, the ship found a sentry post nearby to stop at. Ye Qingyu jumped down, and waved towards Xing'er in farewell.</p>
 <p>"I'll find you later." The mysterious ship shot towards the sky. In the blink of an eye, it disappeared in the blue sky. At this moment, the impulsiveness of the Imperial family was demonstrated fully. If it was other formation airships flying at such height and speed, it would have instantly been destroyed by the formation cannons on the ground.</p>
 <p>"The great building of the military department, I've finally returned!“</p>
 <p>There was a familiarness in Ye Qingyu's heart.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu took quick, fast steps towards the direction of the great building of the military department.</p>
 <p>There were many people rushing about to and fro there. As the heart of the military of the empire, there were countless numbers of military orders being sent out everyday. In the tens of provinces of the empire, even a little military order, had the power to affect the lives of several hundred if not thousands of people. It was even a place where it could decide the fate of a well known military noble.</p>
 <p>This place was the pride of the people of the empire.</p>
 <p>For any soldier of the empire, the great building of the military department was a sacred and authoritative place.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu jumped up the stairs, his gaze scanning at the people he passed.</p>
 <p>His footsteps were hurried because he was rushing to find out what the missions assigned to the eighteen young experts were.</p>
 <p>But when he had just finshed ascending the stairs and was about to push and enter, Ye Qingyu frowned. His footsteps stopped.</p>
 <p>A figure attracted Ye Qingyu's attention.</p>
 <p>It was a normal man. He did not have anything that anyone would pay particular attention to. No matter whether it was appearance or his figure, he was someone that people would not be able to find once he was lost in the crowd. But compared to the people rushing in and out of the great building wearing military uniform, this person was in casual green clothing stood out. His movements were leisurely and unhurried, as if he was strolling the streets. He did not fit in at all with the surrounding environment.</p>
 <p>When Ye Qingyu's gaze looked towards the green-clothed man, his gaze also shot towards Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"En?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was faintly taken aback.</p>
 <p>Because in the gaze of this man, there was a shred of enmity, as well as some sort of mockery and disdain.</p>
 <p>Under Ye Qingyu's watch, the right hand of the green-clothed man that had always been hidden by his sleeve, suddenly waved about.</p>
 <p>Then he turned and left.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's complexion greatly changed.</p>
 <p>Because he could clearly see, there was an item like a white belt held in the hands of the green-clothed young man. No matter whether it was material or style, it was something Ye Qingyu was very family with-----This was part of the clothing of one of the eighteen young experts that he had trained with on the fifty-fifth floor of the great building of the military department.</p>
 <p>"[Avalanche's] sleeve!"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu could instantly recognize it.</p>
 <p>Because on the sleeve was the special red mark of [Avalanche].</p>
 <p>The miltiary uniform of the eighteen young experts were largely similar. But the only minute difference was that it all had their own marking relating to their title. For example, for [Avalanche's] title, his marking was a miniature meteor hammer.</p>
 <p>Apart fro this, there was a series of startling characters written with fresh blood on half of the sleeve----</p>
 <p>"If you want to save him, then follow me along alone!"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's complexion changed. He was about to open his mouth and speak, but the person did not give him the chance. In an instant, he had turned around and left with his head lowered.</p>
 <p>"Ever since [Avalanche] accompanied Qiu Fenghan back during the night, he has not returned... could it be..."</p>
 <p>There was a misfortunate feeling rising in Ye Qingyu's heart.</p>
 <p>With a thought, he followed after the man with gritted teeth.</p>
 <p>The footsteps of that person were neither fast or slow. After leaving the courtyard of the building of the military department, he burrowed under a series of little streets between a series of tweets. His footsteps were slow, but his speed was rapid. Evidently his strength was not low. When he turned his head back to look, he let out a sinister smile and continued on. Clearly he was waiting for Ye Qingyu to catch up intentionally.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu quickly continued after.</p>
 <p>Under the lead of this person, the two gradually left the luxurious and bustling streets and passed through a series of interconnected and interweaving alleyways.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu evaluated this person's strength and whether he should act now.</p>
 <p>If [Avalanche] was really in their hands, then he could not strike now. Since they had sent someone to find him, they must have made their preparation. Even if he acted and captured this person, he would not be able to save [Avalanche]. It was best not to disturb the snake in the bushes, but observe and see what will happen.</p>
 <p>As he thought about this, Ye Qingyu suppressed the urge to act.</p>
 <p>"Xiu, xiu, xiu..."</p>
 <p>There seemed to be no limit to the area covered by the capital.</p>
 <p>It was not that everywhere there were streets and constructed buildings. Within the Capital, there were many interweaving mountains as well as clustered forests.</p>
 <p>After approximately fifteen minutes later, that person finally left an alleyway.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu took two quick strides forward. After chasing him away from the alleyway, the scenery around quickly changed. The number of buildings became less and less, and the greenery as well as trees became more and more.</p>
 <p>Without realizing, Ye Qingyu had already followed this person to near a swathe of towering mountains.</p>
 <p>After reaching the wilderness, the speed of this person suddenly became extremely quick. Like an arrow leaving the bow, he stuck to the ground as he covered ground like lightning, heading towards the vast forests on the foot of the mountains.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had confidence due to his skills. Furthermore, he had a card up his own sleeve that enabled him to escape as he wished so he was not fearful. Closely following behind the green-clothed man, he did not give any opportunity for the opposing party to shake him off.</p>
 <p>Xiu Xiu!</p>
 <p>The figure of the two, streaked past the land three or four meers above the ground like arrows. Their speed was quick, and there was the sound of sharp explosive air being pierced. Everywhere their figures passed, the grass would suddenly shorten, as if invisible blades had cut it. Rocks would split apart and wood would turn into powder.</p>
 <p>From high up above, it was as if some terrifying power was cutting apart two clear and distinct trails.</p>
 <p>After approximately fifteen minutes had passes.</p>
 <p>The figure of the green-clothed man suddenly halted.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s figure flew like an eagle, landing on a boulder twenty meters away.</p>
 <p>"Where is he?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's gaze was like lightning as he stared at this person. An invisible frosty aura had already began emanating from Ye Qingyu’s body.</p>
 <p>"Tut tut tut tut..." There was an icy sinister laughter coming out from the mouth of this green-clothed man. The expression on his face was extremely peculiar, as his figure took one or two step backwards. Then like a bubble, he disappeared, his entire person completely gone from the air.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was startled. His figure shot forward like a bolt of lightning instantly, but he was already late by a step.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, there was the fierce sounds of crows sounding.</p>
 <p>The surrounding scenery should be within a mountain valley. Everywhere around them was clustered forests. And within the forests, there were humongous ancient trees that were about as wide as five people wrapping around it. It shot from the earth towards the sky, shrouding the heavens so much that not a gap could be seen. It gave off an extremely suppressive sensation.</p>
 <p>The place they were in right now was a little depression in the valley.</p>
 <p>It was different from the surrounding clustered forests. There was not the slightest hint of any greenery, and strange shaped boulders were all around.</p>
 <p>Deep within the depression, there seemed to be some derelict old buddhist temples appearing within the darkness. When wind blew past, there would be the painful moaning and creaking of the boards. The walls had fallen over and tiles were scattered over. It was like an old man about to die with half his body in the soil.</p>
 <p>There were several strange shaped ancient trees growing in front of the old buddhist temple. It had long withered away. From far away, it seemed like sinister demons trying to crawl out from the midst of hell.</p>
 <p>"Wu wu wu...."“</p>
 <p>Exactly at this moment, a chill wind blew out from the depths of the depression .It was like the curses of viciosu ghosts roaring at the them. Landing on a person, it could not help but cause the person to shiver all over.</p>
 <p>"It's already dark....”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu lifted his head. Looking at the sky, the sun let out the last shred of sunlight before being swallowed in the dark clouds in the air.</p>
 <p>The layers upon layers of dark clouds did not allow any sunlight to past. Suppressing everything in the heavens, it let out a killing aura.</p>
 <p>This was the so called dark night with high winds, perfect for killing someone.</p>
 <p>Within the depression, Ye Qingyu could clearly sense that strange fluctuation of the qi of heaven and earth. Evidently there was a hidden formation within here. The reason the green-clothed man suddenly disappeared, was not because of the fact that his strength exceeded Ye Qingyu's expectations. It was only that he had long borrowed the formation array hidden here to hide traces of his departure.</p>
 <p>It seemed like the opposing party was prepared before they came.</p>
 <p>They wanted to use a formation array to surround and kill him?</p>
 <p>There was a shred of a smile exposed on Ye Qingyu's lips.</p>
 <p>Such a thought, was perhaps too simple.</p>
 <p>Suddenly---</p>
 <p>"Kacha!"</p>
 <p>A bolt of lightning, shot across the skies nearing.</p>
 <p>That bolt of lighting brightened the entire land for a brief moment, before it once again returned to the bizarre state of endless darkness gradually</p>
 <p>The alarm and caution within Ye Qingyu's heart was fully aroused. His gaze evaluated his surroundings, as he looked around, fully prepared. In a loud voice, "Such a cowardly fellow. To lure me here, but not dare show yourself. Is [Avalanche] in your hands? How is he? If you have guts, then show yourself!"</p>
