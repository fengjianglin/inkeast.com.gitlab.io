 <p>254 - You are a genius</p>
 <p>The white figure retreated in panic.</p>
 <p>Run!</p>
 <p>He was able to sense the threat of death, not daring to stay any longer, immediately deciding to flee.</p>
 <p>As long as he wanted to leave, then he would definitely be able to depart.</p>
 <p>This was the self confidence he had as an assassin.</p>
 <p>Within the white ghost formation, there was nothing that could stop him.</p>
 <p>But at this time, suddenly ---</p>
 <p>Pang!</p>
 <p>There was suddenly a sound of an explosion within his body.</p>
 <p>As if something had exploded.</p>
 <p>He lowered his head in both despair and shock.</p>
 <p>A surge of hidden cold qi that he did not notice before, exploded from within his chest, crushing his lungs.</p>
 <p>The extreme cold qi held within his wounds emanated to his four limbs, numbing him and slowing down his reactions as well as lowering his speed.</p>
 <p>Che!Che!Che!</p>
 <p>Snowflakes flew past.</p>
 <p>Blood spurted.</p>
 <p>In this beautiful dance of snowflakes, the white figure turned into pieces.</p>
 <p>Killed.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu gestured with his hand.</p>
 <p>The snowflakes swirled about in the air, constantly striking against each other. It finally transformed into a whole piece, turning into a snowball the size of hand that landed in Ye Qingyu's palm. It instantly dissolved, turning into pure inner yuan and the [Supreme ice flame] returned within his body.</p>
 <p>Along with the death of the white figure, the surrounding formation array gradually disappeared.</p>
 <p>It was as if the surroundings was mist on a ink painting. The little alleyway was gradually revealed.</p>
 <p>There wasn’t any traces of blood or corpses on the ground. As if nothing had happened whatsoever.</p>
 <p>In this little alleyway that had nothing special at all about it, a terrifying assassin [Faceless King] that had once made the whole Jianghu quiver at the mention of his name, had died in the illusionary formation array. HIs corpse did not exist anymore.</p>
 <p>After Ye Qingyu recovered and regulated his breathing, he turned to depart.</p>
 <p>The assassination seemed to come out of the blue, but on deeper thought, this was to be expected.</p>
 <p>If Ye Qingyu had not reacted in the first instance, and used the [Flowing Shadow Kill] to avoid the first strike, then today would really have been dangerous for him. The first strike of an assassination was the most fatal. At the very least, it would heavily injure the opponent.....</p>
 <p>This faceless white figure, had too much confidence in his assassination techniques.</p>
 <p>Therefore it had committed such an error.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, in these days Ye Qingyu had always prepared to teach Jin Ling'er the [Flowing Shadow Kill] techniques, so he had delved into it and practiced a little bit. But this technique, when used in the hands of Ye Qingyu, contained frost qi and the [Supreme ice flame], causing it to be different from its true form.</p>
 <p>This [Flowing Shadow Kill] was definitely a top level assassination technique used to kill people. However, it seemed more suitable be used to act against assassins instead.</p>
 <p>Because he had cultivated in this technique before, Ye Qingyu's assassination arts had increased. It was only through this that he had managed to avoid the first deadly strike of the faceless ghost.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu turned to leave.</p>
 <p>The identity of the person who had hired this killer to kill him was no longer important.</p>
 <p>It was definitely someone from the sects.</p>
 <p>More importantly, this matter made Ye Qingyu aware, that some people of the sects were already backed into a corner. They dared to stage an assassination against a nobility of the Empire.</p>
 <p>To destroy someone, one must first make it crazy.</p>
 <p>Only when they were crazy, would they show their incriminating evidence.</p>
 <p>Although there did not seem to have been any change on the surface of Youyan Pass, but Lu Zhaoge injuries were already on the way to recovery. This was enough to change the entire situation. The Youyan pass that was once impenetrable had already started to return. Those people who failed to discern this would definitely have a tragic end.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's back disappeared in a street far off.</p>
 <p>The little alleyway was deserted.</p>
 <p>In the air, there were suddenly ripples.</p>
 <p>Two figures walked out from the ripples, appearing from thin air.</p>
 <p>"I've coincidentally passed by, but I got to see such a good show. Who would have thought that Ye Qingyu would be skilled in the assassination arts, and these arts could be called divine. For his techniques to confuse what is real and what is fake, this is really terrifying. The [Faceless King] was a first class killer belonging to the [Killer Pavilion]. He was careless to be killed instead by Ye Qingyu"</p>
 <p>The silhouette that had a draconic air surrounding him sighed.</p>
 <p>The other silhouette, had a golden coloured light surrounding him like a barrier protecting him. One could not discern his true appearance at all. He nodded his head. "What Ye Qingyu used was a top level assassination skill belonging to the shadow attribute. It is extremely skilled and it at least belongs to the Divine Class. The [Faceless King] died justifiably."</p>
 <p>"The title [The Leaf of Youyan] is well deserved it seems. We may have underestimated him."</p>
 <p>"En, for a martial artist that originated from an academy and with no relation to any sects, just how is it possible for him to possess so many miraculous techniques?" The person with the draconic aura surrounding him said in a low voice. "The emotionless gongzi, White browed Yu, both died in his eyes, under different techniques. These evidently are are signs that he originates from the sects. Something is strange about this.”</p>
 <p>"Could it be that he is a successor to some sect of the Upper ancient age?" The person with light covering him suddenly had a thought. "Brother Zhao should have already received some news. The slumbering great sects of the upper ancient age, are about to awaken."</p>
 <p>"If this is really true, then this Ye Qingyu must not be underestimated. To infiltrate into the army, and be given a title of Marquis, his ambitions are not little." The draconic aura man said in a low voice.</p>
 <p>"No matter his background or history, his cultivation is still at its early stages. Could it be that he can suppress us?" The light aura figure said confidently. "The grounds of those ancient sects are about to become cemeteries. Their inheritance has already been broken, and they want to borrow a corpse for them to possess and revive themselves. Haha, right now, it is the world of the Three schools and Three sects. If they don't know death and come to cause trouble, then we'll just exterminate them."</p>
 <p>"Then about Ye Qingyu?"</p>
 <p>"At the Martial alliance meeting, I will personally test his depths. At that time, I hope he will not make me disappointed."</p>
 <p>"“Since senior brother is acting personally, then everything will be solved."</p>
 <p>The two spoke for a bit longer, then once again stepped into the ripples in the air, their figures disappearing.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>At the time Ye Qingyu arrived in Hundred herb hall, Shopkeeper Sui was already waiting at the door.</p>
 <p>Respectfully ushering Ye Qingyu inside, he ordered the workers to not disturb them no matter what happened. Shopkeeper Sui followed Ye Qingyu to the third floor, once again arriving at the chamber from before.</p>
 <p>"En?"</p>
 <p>His gaze piercing through the cloth of his garments, Ye Qingyu could see that apart from the Lin Qingyi from that day, there was another person.</p>
 <p>An old man.</p>
 <p>An old man that had long hair and a young face, his hair as white as desolate snow.</p>
 <p>When Ye Qingyu was evaluating this old man, this old man that had his eyes close and was resting, suddenly opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>It was as if two bolts of lightning shot out from his ancient eyes, piercing towards Ye Qingyu. His gaze was discerning to the extreme, as if it could see through all of the illusions of the world.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu acted instantly. [Supreme ice flame] spurted out from his mouth. Like smoke, it encircled around his face.</p>
 <p>"Eh?"</p>
 <p>There was a trace of surprise on the face of the old man, then he suddenly stood up.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu showed no traces of surprise, but the inner yuan within his body had already secretly acted. Yuan qi was roiling around his entire body.</p>
 <p>In this old man with a youthful face, there was a powerful pressure that emanated from him. He was a extreme level martial artist and could not be underestimated.</p>
 <p>"Hahaha, good, good. No wonder you are the genius that created the [Mysterious Heaven pellet]. For me to not be able to see your true appearance, amazing. " The old man let out a guileless laugh. "My name is Dugu Quan, I wonder what I can call little brother?"</p>
 <p>Dugu Quan?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu seemed to have never heard of this name before.</p>
 <p>There was caution in Ye Qingyu's heart as he replied blandly. "My name is Yuqing Ye. I give my respects to elder."</p>
 <p>"My master is the leading pill master of the Imperial Court, he is known as [Pill God of Snow country]." Lin Qingyi could not help himself volunteering such information after seeing Ye Qingyu's expressionless and motionless reaction to his master's name. He instantly realised, that this person had never heard of his master’s name before.</p>
 <p>As these words were said, Ye Qingyu was really shocked.</p>
 <p>The leading Pill master of the Imperial group of masters?</p>
 <p>Heavens!</p>
 <p>This really was an important person.</p>
 <p>Anyone that belonged to the Empire's Imperial organisation of masters, was definitely an existence that was at its pinnacle in its respective field. To be able to become the leading Pill master of the Imperial court, his position was not any less than that of the War God of Youyan, Lu Zhaoge. Furthermore, the profession of Pill Master was greatly respected. Even in front of the Emperor, there was no needed to bow down. He was definitely a powerful existence that stood at the top of the pyramid.</p>
 <p>No wonder this old man exerted such a tremendous presence.</p>
 <p>"Hahaha, the position of the leading Pill Master is but in name. In front of the creator of the [Mysterious Heaven pellet], this is not even worth mentioning. " Dugu Quan face broke into a wide grin. "I guess that little brother you must not be older than twenty years of age. For you to be able to create an [Sub Spirit Pill], heroes really do emerge from the young. I am humbled."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was startled, enquiring guiltily "How did elder know that I was less than twenty?"</p>
 <p>" Hahahaha," The old man began laughing. "My eyes can not only discern between all the divine herbs in this world, and classify Pills into different grades, I can also recognise people. Even though you have used your secret technique to hide your true face, but a person's aura and body already reveals a lot of information. I can be sure that you are definitely under twenty......En, you should be around sixteen."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was greatly started and piqued.</p>
 <p>No wonder he was the [Pill God of Snow country], he definitely deserved his title.</p>
 <p>"Although I don't know why you must hide your true face, but I believe it must be to do with the [Mysterious Heaven pellet]? Dugu Quan smiled as he gestured for Ye Qingyu to sit, his face amiable and sincere as he said: "Then it must be that even Yuqing Ye is a fake name right?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu sat down then smiled: "I had no other choice."</p>
 <p>"The value of the [Mysterious Heaven pellet] is definitely precious. Especially for the entire Snow Empire, it's hold significant meaning. But it is still an object in the end. In my eyes, its values is far beneath little brother you. At such a young age, for you to be able to create a [Sub Spirit Pill], your future cannot be measured." The old man smiled. "So you do not need to fear, I will handle everything for you. Even if your true identity is leaked, no one will dare to act against you. The position as the creator of the [Mysterious Heaven pellet] will definitely belong to you."</p>
 <p>"Elder compliments me too much. The [Mysterious Heaven pellet] was not pioneered by me. I only discovered a pill formula that came from the Upper ancient ages, and I luckily managed to replicate it. I do not deserve such heavy compliments." Ye Qingyu obviously would not use the [Mysterious Heaven pellet] to fool others, quickly explaining himself.</p>
 <p>"I've already thought of this point before." Dugu Quan smiled as he said. "I've already held and examined this [Mysterious Heaven pellet] for two days and two nights. I can naturally see that the nature of the Pill holds some of the techniques that belongs to the God and Devil age, it should be an ancient Pill formula. But the way you refined it, is far too exquisite. It seems to hold Heaven's way itself, using an ice flame to refine a pill is something I have rarely seen in my life. What makes me shocked, was not only the Pill formula. Little brother, without any exaggeration at all, you are a genius of the Pill path. You do not need to be modest."</p>
 <p>After Ye Qingyu heard this, he wholeheartedly admired the skill that this old man had in Pill making.</p>
 <p>From a single pill, he was able to discern so much. No wonder he was the Pill God of Snow country.</p>
 <p>Then it seemed there was no longer a need to hide himself.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu took off the hat shrouding his head.</p>
