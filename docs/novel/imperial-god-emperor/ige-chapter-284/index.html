 <p><span style>0284 - Everything has been settled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop it, you brat!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A voice of unquestionable authority suddenly sounded from beyond the Proud Sky Center. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the midst of empty space, thousands of meters high, there was a bizarre shaft of golden brilliance. In the middle of it, a silver vortex swirling like the eye of the ocean could be seen, from which a towering green giant hand stretched out. Its five fingers were curling and wrapping around each other within a cloud of mist. Thunder rumbled and lightning flashed, the dense formations flickering as the giant palm that contained the power to destroy the earth directly headed down towards Proud Sky Center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rays of the Cold Moon Frost sword were instantly shattered by the huge hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A brat of the younger generation, how dare you be so arrogant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice resonated again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That big hand pressed down at Ye Qingyu with a blast of cold air. It was as though the entire blue sky had collapsed, and the space above Bright Moon Lake was also completely blocked off. With Ye Qingyu’s current power and cultivation realm, there was no way he could have stopped this tremendous force. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was too powerful! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shishuzu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qiushui, in his despair, suddenly saw a ray of hope. He immediately determined where this big hand had originated from. His face lit up with joy as he excitedly yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Embarrassing, to be defeated by a little soldier from the army. Return with me and cultivate for another ten years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice appeared to come from tens of thousands of miles away, containing an unquestionable majesty. But every single word that was uttered sounded like the rage of heavens, whipping up strong gusts of wind. Everybody thought the sound waves were like a drum, the vibration inducing numbness all over the body. The power contained inside was inconceivable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it the old ancestor of Crepe Myrtle Sect?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a true Power within the martial arts world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But——</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, Elder Cao is really good at making jokes. Since Marquis Ye has already represented the Empire in making a decision, I think it’s best if Li Qiushui stay behind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another voice echoed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mysterious scholar in white who sat quietly in the first Xian Pavilion suddenly opened her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was in a comfortable position, lazily leaning back on a huge chair. Then she raised her head slightly, and on her white and delicate face was a faint smile, as if speaking about something irrelevant to her. She seemed to not have the slightest intention of acting. Her body also seemed frail, like an ordinary person who had not cultivated at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the giant hand that was in the midst of stirring up storm and thunder suddenly paused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When a child has made a mistake, we should give him a chance to correct himself,” the old ancestor of Crepe Myrtle Sect spoke with a slight waver in his voice, no longer as powerful as before. There was a tone of negotiation in his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in the first Xian Pavilion, the mysterious scholar in white did not say anything. She simply sat quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silence for a long while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old ancestor of Crepe Myrtle Sect let out a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The momentum of the chaotic storm the giant hand invoked dissipated. Its power faded, slowly shrinking back into the vortex in space and eventually disappearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had agreed in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Marquis Ye, the road of Jianghu is long. Even the strongest people cannot always be in the upper hand, there is still a long way ahead. Those that were first in the limelight, perhaps the next moment they will become a pile of bones in the wilderness. Crepe Myrtle Sect will take a step back today, we shall meet again someday. I hope you take good care of yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The final voice of old ancestor of Crepe Myrtle Sect echoed from within the vortex.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, even the silver vortex like the eye of the ocean, completely vanished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone could discern the naked threat present within the words of the old ancestor of Crepe Myrtle Sect in this last exchange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, this martial arts authority who could, with one stamp of his foot, make the entire Jianghu tremble, retreated. Because of the words of some unknown scholar, he had hesitated for a long moment and in the end really gave up on the young martial leader Li Qiushui that the Crepe Myrtle Sect had spent decades of painstaking effort to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From all this, it was evident that the old ancestor was deathly wary of the scholar in white.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The words that he left before he disappeared were evidently full of anger, and it was all directed at Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The road of Jianghu was long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One could imagine that one day, the Crepe Myrtle Sect will definitely pay back [The Leaf of Youyan].</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingyu smiled an indifferent smile, showing no appreciation to this threat at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling his body beginning to decline in strength and inner yuan, Ye Qingyu knew that the power of the ‘Three Limits’ of the [Limitless Divine Way] had begun to fade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He drew a deep breath, looking down. His eyes were cold and his voice uncompromising when he uttered, “Li Qiushui, since you are a martial genius the Empire has rarely seen in the last 30 years, I can save your face and leave you with a whole intact corpse. You decide, do not force me to take the last trace of dignity from you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Qiushui had a look of despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not think that he could not be saved even when the old ancestor had acted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That mysterious scholar in white, just who was she? How could she be so terrifying?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Qingyu, don’t look so smug. Since you embarked on this path, sooner or later you will have a similar fate to me. On the road to the land of the dead, I, Li Qiushui, will quietly wait for your arrival.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, he is a genius of the generation, one of the most influential figures of the Jianghu in the recent decades. In his last moments, he eventually calmed down. A bleak smile was on his face, not as panicky and ungraceful as before. He looked at Ye Qingyu, his eyes sinister and full of resentment. After leaving behind a short sentence, suddenly the veins in his whole body ruptured. A barrage of blood arrows was unleashed from his meridians as his life drained away from his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Li!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several disciples of the Crepe Myrtle Sect rushed out, helping to support the toppling body of Li Qiushui. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The fox is sad at the death of a hare. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this scene, the people of Jianghu by Bright Moon Lake could not help but feel a sorrowful hesitation. Li Qiushui, an important person like the emperor of Jianghu, finally perished in such a tragic way. He could not even save his own life. This scene made the arrogant people of Jianghu who had always thought highly of themselves think carefully about the positions they should take in the Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Qingyu, my Crepe Myrtle Sect will remember this blood feud. Although I am only a lower no-name disciple, but I will not forget the shame we experienced today. Someday in the future, I will definitely repay you,” a young disciple of Crape Myrtle Sect couldn’t refrain from yelling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemed not even twenty years old. He was trembling as he supported the body of Li Qiushui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This young disciple of Crepe Myrtle Sect was evidently a crazy admirer of Li Qiushui. Tears welled in his eyes, and there was hatred flickering in his pupils. He growled with gritted teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several other young disciples of Crepe Myrtle Sect also glared at Ye Qingyu hatefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Jianghu, lifelong debts and hatreds were common.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many lifetime blood feuds had started in such a way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just who would remember who was in the right and who was in the wrong at the beginning?</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many people by the shore of the Bright Moon Lake that were beginning to get worried for these fearless Disciples of the Crepe Myrtle Sect. Ye Qingyu’s ruthless heart made people tremble with fear. Any who dared to be impudent and insulting in front of him were mercilessly killed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Ye Qingyu only nodded solemnly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine. I will await for your arrival no matter the time. I just hope that your vengeance can come open and honourably. If it is malicious and vicious and involves innocent people, then my sword will not mind being stained with blood again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The several young disciples of Crepe Myrtle Sect fell silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With their eyes red from crying, they carefully and gently cleaned up the body of Li Qiushui, wrapping him in plain white cloth. They respectfully carried him on their shoulders and turned away with gritted teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This martial arts meeting had already ended from the perspective of the Crepe Myrtle Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The situation of the Dragon Tiger Sect was even worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The [Tiger Saint Child], Zhao Shanhe, had been killed in a flash. His bones and corpse did not exist anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the fourth Xian Pavilion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sacred Dragon child of the Dragon Faction in the Dragon Tiger Sect was quietly standing in front of the pavilion railing. He was shrouded in a light layer of mist, his expression hidden. It was unknown whether he was happy or sad from the results of the event.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that [Desolate Tooth of the Tiger Saint] is only a replica. No wonder it could be broken so easily... It seems Zhao Shanhe did not really receive the recognition of the Tiger Faction. The Tiger Faction often acts mysteriously and slyly; it is safe to assume that they have a back-up plan. The [Tiger Saint Child] of this generation might just be a cover for the true [Tiger Saint Child] hiding within the sect.” The Sacred Dragon Child thought pensively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to the high-profile and arrogant [Tiger Saint Child] Zhao Shanhe, the Dragon Faction [Sacred Dragon Child] was known to be mysterious. He was secretive in his movement and hard to trace like a Dragon. Although he was powerful, but he would largely not participate in the fights of Jianghu. The fact that he came to participate in the Proud Sky Center martial arts meeting this time had already surprised many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned around to take a glance at the two concubines trembling behind him. Having lost the protection of Zhao Shanhe, the two women could no longer stay in Dragon Tiger Sect. There was a gleam of pity coming from the eyes of the [Dragon Saint Child]. He more or less knew about the story of these two women - they were pitiful people. You could not always do as you wish in Jianghu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The [Dragon Saint Child] activated the formation array. Landing to the ground, he brought the two girls away from the Proud Sky Center. A silver aura seeped out from his body, like mist, covering the figures of the two girls. He disappeared very quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dragon Tiger Sect will definitely give Marquis Ye a satisfactory answer on what happened in Youyan Pass.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice of [Dragon Saint Child] echoed in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingyu nodded. He did not pursue the matter further from other disciples of the Dragon Tiger Sect. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Youyan army and Wen Wan had investigated [Dragon Saint Child] before. The final evaluation was rather positive - compared to the cruel and treacherous [Tiger Saint Child] Zhao Shanhe, the mysterious [Dragon Saint Child] was regarded as a positive character. He was seldom involved in the disputes of Jianghu and had his own principles. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Tiger Sect was so powerful that it had divided into the Dragon Faction and the Tiger Faction hundreds of years ago. Although the two factions were one on the surface, but they secretly fought internally countless times. As a result, the Dragon Saint Child and Zhao Shanhe were not harmonious. It was said that the actions of Zhao Shanhe in Youyan Pass basically had nothing to do with the Dragon Faction, and there was nothing the [Dragon Saint Child] could do to restrain him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So Ye Qingyu did not want to provoke this mysterious [Dragon Saint Child].</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the [Dragon Saint Child] had uttered such words, the Dragon Tiger Sect would most certainly give an explanation to the Youyan Army about this matter. That was enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was rumoured that [Dragon Saint Child] always kept his promise. Most likely, when he returns to the sect, the two factions of the Dragon Tiger sect would break into a bloody fight between themselves. Perhaps the Dragon Faction had long been waiting for a suitable opportunity to suppress the Tiger Faction and unify the Dragon Tiger Sect, but these were not Ye Qingyu’s concerns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that the situation has developed to such an extent, the events of the martial arts meeting of Proud Sky Center was already completely settled.</span></p>
