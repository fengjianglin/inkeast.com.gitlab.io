 <p>Chapter 352 - The Dragon Fist Secret Technique</p>
 <p>There were people that dared to attack and kill the young experts selected by the empire, are they trying to throw the empire into disorder?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu remembered that along his way here, he saw those deserted and chaotic small towns. The empire’s law was being trampled on, poor people’s lives becoming increasingly challenging, the aristocracy expanding, martial artists willingly killing, bandits everywhere, large tracts of abandoned farmland, and people of the sect not respecting the law...</p>
 <p>Currently, the Snow Country, on the surface, still looks extremely bright. It seemed as if they were an empire that occupied a dominant position in the Heaven Wasteland Domain, flourishing as before, and attracted the envy of the Demon Race and the other races, but in reality?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu felt that, after the almost one hundred years of peacefulness since the founding of the empire, many parts of the empire have begun to decay, but many people had not yet realized it.</p>
 <p>After announcing the absence of the last two places, the training camp was about to officially begin.</p>
 <p>After a boring night, in the early morning of the second day, before breakfast, several important figures of the military have come to the training camp. After the first two days, Ye Qingyu had come to know one or two of them. There were a first grade Marquis, Wang Yu, a first grade military Marquis, Zheng Yunfei, a second grade Marquis, Xia Lei, as well as a hereditary Marquis, Fang Cun.</p>
 <p>These were the most illustrious existences of the empire. In addition to being in charge of the military department, they were also responsible for the ordinary affairs of the military, especially the Marquis with a long sword hanging at his waist, Fang Cun. It is said that he was born in an aristocratic family, which is related to the Imperial family. There is royal blood flowing in his body, and he had fought across the empire at a young age, earned many military achievements and was now the head of the military staff department. Although he inherited the noble title and was not earned through military achievements, he still had a very high prestige in the military.</p>
 <p>And these three military Marquis evidently was headed by Fang Cun.</p>
 <p>The talk from these few big shots was very simple, having the special characteristics and unique style of a military-born commander, concise and sharp. But the content of the lecture was somewhat flat, and only roughly stated that both the military and the royal family were very optimistic about these young experts and in the following one month, the empire will invest a lot of financial and material resources to cultivate them...</p>
 <p>As for one month later, what paths the 18 people would take were not mentioned.</p>
 <p>Then they were introduced to a few instructors.</p>
 <p>The one assuming the responsibility of chief military instructor was obviously Fang Cun, but the other important figures were also incredibly busy, and of course would not really guide them. The real guides to the 18 young people were real military masters picked out from the army. A total of four people, each one of them was a military expert that had already entered the Bitter Sea stage.</p>
 <p>After his observation, Ye Qingyu was sure that these four military Marquis were of the first stage of the Bitter Sea stage, roughly the same level as himself, at the creek of the Bitter Sea, but their degree of body refining was also far below him. Everyone had a grave and stern look on their face, like cast iron, serious in speech and manner, and from their face there was not the slightest emotion or colour, like a statue.</p>
 <p>Although Ye Qingyu had great respect for the experts of the army, he did not think that these four soldiers were strong enough to teach him.</p>
 <p>The only place that this camp was attractive to him was the supply of meals high in yuan qi and Origin crystals every day, and the opportunity to learn about the operation and state of the empire.</p>
 <p>Having figured this out, Ye Qingyu did not hold too much expectations for the training sessions.</p>
 <p>After the few military figures had left, the training officially began.</p>
 <p>The first class was taught by one of the four instructors, a burly, ape-like middle-aged man.</p>
 <p>“Your strength and military accomplishment, the military has a record. I also know very clearly, so the following training is a program that twenty-one senior staffs of the military spent one month to develop and drawn up. For this training, the Empire had used a large number of precious cultivation resources, spent countless people’s painstaking efforts, therefore you must succeed without fail. So I hope that you will be able to strictly follow these training programs as a soldier.”</p>
 <p>“My name is Bao Shinu, if you have any problem wait until the training is over, and then report to me,” the ape like-aged man shouted angrily.</p>
 <p>Training began.</p>
 <p>Bao Shinu’s voice fell, when a white brilliance emerged from his hand, and penetrated into the training camp lapis lazuli wall.</p>
 <p>The light flashed and the energy surged.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu suddenly felt his body sinking, the strength of his body suddenly increasing, the air instantly become sticky, and the formation around him flickering. The strength of the rune formation was multiplying rapidly, and every young expert felt as though their body was being tied up, their movements becoming difficult.</p>
 <p>“The secret technique that I’m about to teach you is known as the empire’s most mysterious skill of refining the body, the [Dragon Fist]. It is extremely effective in refining the body of a Bitter Sea expert. Back then, only a noble that is a second grade Marquis and above, and had achieved notable military merits was allowed to cultivate [Dragon Fist]. This time, the empire allowing you to practice this technique is a gift from the heavens, you must grasp this opportunity.”</p>
 <p>Bao Shinu bellowed, his voice like thunder.</p>
 <p>As he spoke, he began to show the gesture and motion of the nine-move [Dragon Fist].</p>
 <p>The Human Race of the Heaven Wasteland Domain, revered the number nine. The dragon is the symbol of royalty, so [Dragon Fist] had nine moves.</p>
 <p>The expressions of the young experts that were originally full of disdain, at this time, also turned serious.</p>
 <p>Even Ye Qingyu was looking earnestly at Bao Shinu’s demonstration.</p>
 <p>About the prestige of the [Dragon Fist], Ye Qingyu had once read about in the White Deer Academy library. It is said that this secret technique is one of the lost knowledge of the empire’s royal family and was created by the founder of the Snow Empire, the Snow Emperor. It had its amazing moment for a period of time, known as the first secret technique of refining the body for the experts of the Bitter Sea stage of Heaven Wasteland Domain, and had brought about countless valiant military generals. Only noble Marquis that had achieved notable achievements were qualified to cultivate this technique.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu also extremely looked forward to learning this fist technique.</p>
 <p>But because of his low background, it was impossible for him to obtain the profound meaning of refining the body, so he could only think about it.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly today, in this place, he had the opportunity to learn the [Dragon Fist]. This was really an unexpected surprise.</p>
 <p>Not only Ye Qingyu, the other 17 young experts were also shocked, greatly surprised.</p>
 <p>This group of 18 young experts had two common characteristics——</p>
 <p>Firstly, they were all young and famous.</p>
 <p>Secondly, they were all of ordinary birth, not descendants of nobles.</p>
 <p>Almost everyone relied on their own efforts and talent, progressing steadily. They had fought in many battles to accumulate a little bit of fame and title, and to achieve the status that they had today.</p>
 <p>Of the 18 people, the oldest was just 30 years old.</p>
 <p>Judging by the phases of age of a strong martial artist, they all belonged to the juvenile stage.</p>
 <p>Perhaps in the border army, they had a prominent reputation.</p>
 <p>But at the empire capital, Snow Capital, everything will have to begin anew.</p>
 <p>The tiny titles of nobility they had, within the great hall of the military headquarters were not even worth mentioning. As for their martial cultivation they were so proud of, they could not even enter into the [Divine Dragon List], nor even the [Hidden Dragon List].</p>
 <p>To be able to have the opportunity to practice [Dragon Fist] with their status and position, every young expert was shocked and extremely excited.</p>
 <p>Only that every one of them had experienced too much, they were too mature, to exclaim aloud in public or sigh over and over again, like an ordinary person.</p>
 <p>Every one of them took control of their own shock and state of mind, concentrating all their attention on instructor Bao Shinu’s demonstration of the nine moves of [Dragon Fist].</p>
 <p>Bai Shinu’s demonstration was very quick, staying in the same place his figure was like an illusion, one into two, two into three, three into nine... Finally nine life-like illusionary images emerged, showing the motion and gesture of the nine moves. The scene displayed a rhythmic movement and pace. The nine images then constantly grew dimmer and dimmer, disappearing like bubbles, and finally only the real body remained.</p>
 <p>“The first move.”</p>
 <p>After Bao Shinu’s demonstration, he did not stop. He continued to demonstrate the second move.</p>
 <p>He demonstrated three times in a row, before he stopped.</p>
 <p>At this time, the 18 young experts were quietly standing in their original place. Someone’s eyes gleamed with light, some people stood with their eyes closed in thought, some people moved slightly in accordance with the instructions, as if they had already learnt the [Dragon Fist].</p>
 <p>Bao Shinu nodded satisfiedly.</p>
 <p>These 18 people can be absolutely regarded as the most exceptional non noble-born military experts of the empire. They were the martial geniuses that had been picked with the power of the Empire, and every one of them had monstrous talent. Although they had already seen the complex [Dragon Fist] three times, they had already begun to understand it.</p>
 <p>The [Dragon Fist] secret technique must be coordinated with special breathing technique methods in order to achieve the most perfect effect, but solely the motion and gesture of these nine moves were already extremely difficult to understand. These 18 youngsters, every one of them was vastly terrifying.</p>
 <p>“It’s a pity, those two youngsters died on the their way here,” Bao Shinu said regretfully.</p>
 <p>The fall of such young geniuses was a great loss for the empire.</p>
 <p>He was in deep thought, while his gaze wandered around, sweeping past every youngster’s face and finally falling on Ye Qingyu, when he was slightly taken aback, because Bao Shinu noticed that all the other youngster have begun to imitate the nine-move [Dragon Fist], yet Ye Qingyu was still standing quietly, a calm expression on his face, no joy, no sadness, and not the slightest of action.</p>
 <p>Bao Shinu recognized Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>In fact, he knew every single one of the young experts.</p>
 <p>And not only recognize, but was very familiar with the level of strength of each individual, their real military strength, the weapons and skills that they were adept in, as well as personality, age, temper and martial arts talent etc. Bao Shinu knew the information about the youngster so well that he could almost recite it backwards.</p>
