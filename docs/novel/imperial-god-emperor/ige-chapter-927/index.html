 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the second day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sun had just risen into the sky, giving off a fine shine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing on the central square of Matchless Blade City, Ye Qingyu began to talk about martial arts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without even mentioning his present Saint cultivation and Great Saint battle strength, his path of cultivation alone was full of diverse learnings. Furthermore, he had experienced things which nobody from the Heaven Wasteland Domain had ever seen before, and had fought against experts from other domains in countless battles of various scales without being defeated even once. As a result, his horizons and knowledge, as well as his understanding of the martial path, could be said to surpass those of an entire martial generation of the Heaven Wasteland Domain, and therefore, as he began to talk, he was able to explain profound ideas in simple language without end. In the ears of many martialists, his words sounded like the music of the Great Dao, enlightening them almost at once and making them feel like they were becoming Immortals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice diffused throughout the entire square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, more and more people gathered on the square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">News of Lord Ye Qingyu’s martial arts lecture had spread since the previous night, such that by early morning on this day, many people knew of it and, without exception, immediately flocked to Matchless Blade City while quietly regretting only that they did not come sooner, or otherwise they could have made full use of this opportunity rather than missing out on a portion of it as they did by arriving only at this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had no intention of waiting for latecomers. He lectured until noon, when he announced a temporary break and turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people on the square remained as if inebriated by what they had listened to, while even more people went into a meditative trance akin to a state of enlightenment in which they became oblivious to everything around them, completely immersed in an introspection of their own martial path and learnings...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four hours later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu reappeared and resumed his martial lecture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When dusk arrived, he stood up and left once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the moonlight, countless figures continued to sit quietly on the square, motionless. Although some were truly gaining enlightenment, others whose enlightenments were shallow simply did not dare to move for fear that they would not be able to get back a seat on the square in the next few days if they stood up and left. By this time, the square had become so overcrowded that there was not even a gap to stick a needle in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve got it, haha, I’ve got it.” A young man in his twenties suddenly exclaimed wildly in pleasant surprise. After listening to sutras for a day, he had completely smashed through the martial path shackles which had troubled him for a long time. Silently, he had broken through to the pinnacle of the Heaven Ascension realm, and only now realized this. For some time, he could not control his emotions, and danced wildly in deviation from his usual self.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Silence!” a supreme martial expert berated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an inexplicable majesty in his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given that a significant number of people on the square had gained a breakthrough after listening to the sutras, there would be absolute chaos if every one of them danced unbridledly in joy, while lifelong hatreds would form if they disturbed the enlightenment states of others. Hence, they had to restrain themselves if they did not want to become public enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man froze for a moment before he hurriedly restrained himself and dared not say anything further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was also a person of understanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Similar events happened on similar-sized squares in many different places.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu’s comprehension of the martial path was so deep that the saintly lectures he gave could be said to be historic in the Heaven Wasteland Domain. The content of his lectures was applicable to all, whether one was a Spirit Spring stage warrior or an Immortal Step realm ace. Even the Heaven Wasteland’s martial veterans benefited greatly, while those warriors who had been doubtful of this Heaven Wasteland martial champion swiftly realized that Ye Qingyu’s martial cultivation and comprehension surpassed theirs completely, to the extent that they would never ever be able to catch up with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The number of people on the square increased with every passing moment, and eventually, there was absolutely no more sitting space. Many people were thus forced to sit on the surrounding stone walls and constructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even mid-air was sat full of people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many experts who arrived late and did not get to listen to the first day of lectures were steeped in regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;“Sigh, why didn’t Lord Ye Qingyu delay his lectures by a few days?” A travel-worn warrior said with a little regret, “After all, there are still many people who aren’t able to get here soon enough. Wouldn’t it have been better if he gave a notice three days before he began his lectures, so that more warriors could get here and listen to them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was rebuked disdainfully as soon as he spoke, “Lord Ye Qingyu’s lectures are meant to repay those good men who strove to save Matchless Blade City from danger, not folks like you who rushed here upon hearing of this opportunity. You’re just basking in reflected glory, yet you aren’t content enough to have such an incredible opportunity to listen to his lectures. How dare you be judgmental of him, you must really know no shame!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. I’ve never seen such a shameless person before,” someone added.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The warrior who had been grumbling became red-faced at once. He wanted to justify himself a bit, but when he saw the angry expressions on the faces looking at him, he dared not say anything else and hurriedly lowered his head in search of a place to sit down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the time when he was not giving a lecture, Ye Qingyu was not idling either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over a past period of time, there were an extremely large number of Heaven Wasteland warriors who had been injured at Wen Fusheng’s hands. Using the power of the Matchless Blade Office, Ye Qingyu located these people and personally treated their injuries. Wen Fusheng’s martial techniques belonged to a foreign sect, and thus there were very few people who could treat those he injured. In fact, many warriors had no chance of recovery throughout their lifetimes, and were even at risk of dying in torment. Ye Qingyu certainly would not allow these warm-blooded martial artists who had defended the glory of the Heaven Wasteland Domain to suffer such a miserable end. Therefore, while treating their injuries one after another, he also helped them to advance their cultivation as a form of repayment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his view, these injured people were the truly respectable martial forces of the Heaven Wasteland Domain and were truly warm-blooded men, and that was why they deserved the most generous rewards. The people who came to Matchless Blade City but did not take any action were secondary in his considerations, while those who dared not even come were the last of his considerations. Hence, his primary purpose for staying in Matchless Blade City over these few days was for the sake of these injured people, while his lectures and the establishment of Matchless Arsenal were but spur-of-the-moment ideas. Ultimately, his actions were intended to beef up the martial strength of the Heaven Wasteland Domain to the greatest extent he could manage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three days later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">News arrived from the imperial city that Empress Yu Xiaoxing had left the pass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he concluded his final lecture, Ye Qingyu left behind in Matchless Blade City a few medicines and herbs to be used for the subsequent treatment of the injured people. He then designated a ten-story stone building prepared by Qin Zhishui as the base of Matchless Arsenal, for which he personally set up a few arrays and picked a few martial path secret books to be stored within to serve as its foundational heritage. He also entrusted the secret key for activating the arrays to Qin Zhishui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he did all this, he stood up and took his leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The square on which he gave his lectures remained packed full of people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Greatly enlightened by the lectures, many people remained sitting still for several years and even centuries. In what could be called a miracle, they gained Dao and their strength grew by leaps and bounds as soon as they regained consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result of Ye Qingyu’s lectures here, this square would forever be remembered by posterity, becoming a holy ground for successive generations of Heaven Wasteland martialists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also, because of the battle that took place here, Matchless Blade City’s fame skyrocketed among the Heaven Wasteland Domain, such that it became the undisputed number one sect of the domain. Allegedly, Wu Shanglong, the Tiger Saint child of the Dragon Tiger Sect, was infinitely moved after the fact. “From this day onward, the Heaven Wasteland Domain’s Three Sects and Three Schools are history. We’ve officially entered an age in which one city reigns supreme. It will never again be possible for any sect or school to surpass Matchless Blade City...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Snow capital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Governance Hall of the imperial palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu met Yu Xiaoxing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having cultivated in self-isolation, her countenance was clearly a lot ruddier than before. Complemented by her empress robes and crown, her originally-already delicate and beautiful looks became even more peerlessly charming, with a few added touches of heroic spirit. At first glance, she resembled a legendary goddess who caused one’s heart to palpitate and also rendered one unable to refrain from submitting and worshipping her.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu laughed, “The martial world is different from an imperial palace. When I’m entertaining important officials from an empire, just a few drinks would do. However, when associating with martial artists, I have to drink heavily and talk about a broad range of things so as to truly fit in. The matter of Wen Fusheng has reminded us that, now that the Domain Gate has been fully opened, not only will the empire face a huge test but all forces within the domain may also be reshuffled as a result. In particular, the Heaven Wasteland martial world will soon face considerable challenge and pressure from foreign martial artists. The martial path is upheld within the Vast Thousand Domains, while according to the laws of the jungle, the strong reigns supreme. The development of the empire’s military strength naturally cannot slacken, yet support and guidance for the Heaven Wasteland martial world remains an urgent priority.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After she finished listening, Yu Xiaoxing grinned and responded, “Cousin, I’ll take your word for it. I’ll get Lin Zheng to assign people to get started on this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was not a single trace of an empress’ stateliness and decisiveness in her tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu did not know whether to laugh or cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew about her affection for him. Normally, in front of outsiders, she would act peerlessly dignified and carry an imperial vigor, such that when the old ministers such as Lin Zheng were facing her, they would tremble with fear and not dare to be shabby in any way. Throughout the entire dynasty, everyone held her in awe and veneration. It was only in front of him that she would drop her empress vigor and become akin to an innocent and unaffected young girl. To this, he did not know whether to shake his head or to laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, from a different perspective, this was a good thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless of her present status and the responsibilities she bore on her shoulders, she was after all still a young girl who was at her most brilliant age. It was a good thing that there was someone who could allow her to take off the mask she wore regularly and relax for a bit. At the moment, he was clearly the most suitable person for this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, he did not bring up any more political matters with her - in reality, he was never really interested in these things anyway. After chatting for an hour or so, Yu Xiaoxing suddenly sprang up and led him to the back garden.</span></p>
