 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's persona now was completely in line with his reputation as a "God of Death" and "Insane Devil".</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Murderous energy circled around his body as if it had a real essence. It looked like a vortex was spiraling around him, distorting all the light nearby. He was completely void of sympathy as he stepped on the [Demon Sage], causing his body to burst into a gory mess again. The [Demon Sage]'s blood stained the gates of Blue Cloud Manor red, along with the streets of Wuqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Aah..." Purple Night roared in agony.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was currently being humiliated as badly... no, much more badly than Fang Bule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Bule was human after all, and it was still somewhat reasonable for him to kneel and bow down before Ye Qingyu, who was the Third Deputy of the Human Race. The [Demon Sage], however, was from the Demon Race, and his body had been trampled upon and made to explode multiple times by Ye Qingyu in front of the White-robed Divine Guards, Black Guards of the Demon Race, and thousands of martial artists from Wuqing street. This was much more humiliating than someone forcing his head down onto the ground to kowtow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fish airships hovering in the air opened fire suddenly.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Twenty green energy beams, each ten meters wide, shot out of the huge cannons from the bows of the airships toward Ye Qingyu. It looked as though twenty light swords from the divine had come slashing at him after he was condemned to death. They tore the sky apart and came crashing down at Ye Qingyu with alarming speed, and a huge, destructive power was contained in them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such types of artillery were the culmination of all forms of artifact creation with formations known to civilization, and they were real beasts of war. The Black Fish airship of the Black Guards was one of the most famous warships in the Alliance of Domains, and even in the Vast Thousand Domains. Its cannons contained the essence and best formations; even a Great Saint would be severely wounded if they did not defend themselves against these twenty energy beams.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, there had been no warning signs before the big guns blazed away. It was a complete sneak attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Despicable..." Huang Tianfang and the others roared angrily and anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It did not help matters, however. They could not even react in time to help Ye Qingyu, and just as they began to hear the sounds of the cannons firing, the twenty energy beams had smashed into him without any hesitation. A green glow of destruction surged forth and engulfed the entire area quickly, along with Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lord Ye Qingyu..." Huang Tianfang shouted as he dashed into the fray, wanting to rescue the Third Deputy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Ye Qingyu ended up seriously wounded by the attack, the Black Guards, [Demon Sage], Fang Bule, and the others would definitely take the opportunity to swarm him. Huang Tianfang was determined to rescue Ye Qingyu no matter what he had to sacrifice. Even if he were to end up bloodied or crippled, or if the entire Blue Cloud Manor would end up in ruins, he was bent on saving his friend today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In any case, he went all in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to tell the world that there were still tough, resilient people among the Human Race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, however, a powerful and clear voice rang out, "Don't be hasty."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Ye Qingyu's voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Tianfang was stunned and stood rooted to the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned to look at the green energy beams that were fired from the huge cannons. They should have engulfed and destroyed most of Wuqing street by now, but instead, they were no longer as intense and powerful as before. Amazingly, they had died down a little, like an angry beast that had met an animal trainer, and they were slowly congregating in one spot. Eventually, all of that light and energy condensed into a green, glowing ball about the size of a fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It landed on someone's palm, which looked white and pristine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It belonged to Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The turbulence died down and the dust settled. Ye Qingyu, who had been blasted by those twenty energy beams from the giant cannons of the Black Fish airships, reappeared in front of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only did his body bear no signs of wounds, but even his clothes seemed to be completely untouched. It was as if he had not been struck by the main cannon of the airships, but by twenty water guns instead. Ye Qingyu lowered his head to look at the green ball of light on his palm, and his expression was extremely chilling. "Very well, it seems like the headquarters of the Demon Race really wants a war... Haha, I shall grant you your wish then," he said casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before his voice had died down—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The green ball of light began to give off a dazzling brilliant glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Twenty piercing beams of light shot out from the ball, streaking through the sky like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No..." [Demon Sage's] expression changed drastically, but he could do nothing to stop Ye Qingyu now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The twenty Black Fish airships hovering in the air above Blue Cloud Manor were directly hit by the energy bolts, and they exploded into twenty huge balls of flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sparks flew and carcasses were scattered into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Fish airships were ranked first among the medium-sized warships of the Demon Race, but now they looked as weak as balloons. Flames and smoke enveloped the entire sky, adding brilliance and beauty to the scenery in the sky above Wuqing street as night drew near, as if a display of fireworks was in progress. The dazzling light illuminated several districts nearby and alarmed many people in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a pity that this amazing and beautiful display of light also came with screams of agony and blazing flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It caused that beautiful sight to be a little imperfect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instant the airships blew up, nearly one hundred Black Guards of the Demon Race were instantly engulfed by the flames and burned to ash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining Black Guards, who amounted to about four hundred, managed to escape somehow but were covered with wounds and sprinted around frantically like mad dogs. They had probably not expected, even in their wildest dreams, that Ye Qingyu would really dare to attack the airships belonging to the Demon Race, so they had not even activated the defensive shields of the ships. In an instant, nearly all of the fleet had been wiped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purple Night was ashen-faced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt his heart turn cold and he became extremely afraid as he watched the remnants of the airships dropping down from the sky along with the light from the flames, which was still glowing brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All twenty Black Fish airships had been destroyed in an instant, and it was no small loss even to the Demon Race of the Alliance of Domains, who possessed a great number of assets. It would have been hard to account for the loss even if Purple Night had managed to capture Ye Qingyu, Huang Tianfang, or the White-robed Divine Guards who had escaped and taken them back to headquarters. But he had even failed to achieve this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang Tianfang and the White-robed Divine Guards in Blue Cloud Manor were stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Twenty Black Fish airships... They had never expected that Ye Qingyu could destroy all of them in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was worthy of the title [Ice Sword Killing God] and he really was Insane Devil Ye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Bule, who had just stood up, immediately knelt down again after witnessing the spectacle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fear lingered in his heart, and for the first time in his life, he felt that he was extremely lucky to be a member of the Human Race. If he was not, he was sure that he would have already been beaten into a pulp by this insane devil. After all, he was a leader of this mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hundreds of White-robed Divine Guards who surrounded Blue Cloud Manor were all staring wide-eyed with their mouths agape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each race had set up headquarters in the divine temple of the Alliance of Domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the headquarters of the Demon Race, that of the humans had always been in a disadvantageous situation. In the past, the demons dared not to overstep their boundaries as the humans were led by the powerful and ruthless Ren Puyang. Less than a month after he died, the status of the Human Race's headquarters diminished considerably, and the demons, along with other races, began to taunt and humiliate the humans. Under the strict orders of the First Deputy, the White-robed Divine Guards had to bear the taunts and give in to the other races; their superiors believed that it was for the greater good of their kind. That said, it was hard for them to not bear any grudges. After all, they were martial arts experts who were young and energetic. How could they control their temper that well?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had kept their anger in check for about a month now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, they received orders to capture and kill their old comrades, and even though they had to follow the orders from above, their feelings were extremely conflicted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was no exaggeration to say that most of the loyal and just White-robed Divine Guards found what they had gone through these past few days hard to accept, but they were powerless to change things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, however, most of the Divine Guards could feel an indescribable feeling of uninhibited joy and redemption as they watched the airships explode, the Black Guards fleeing, and the [Demon Sage] Purple Night curling up like a kitten, his arrogance totally gone. Even though they knew that they were basically Ye Qingyu's opponents now, they were still humans after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Humans should not be bullied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people had used the same words before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, however, as they came from Insane Devil Ye's mouth, the phrase stirred their emotions and all of them could identify with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was convincing enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many others had talked the talk but could not walk the walk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the First Deputy, who was the highest ranking officer and overall controller in the Human Race headquarters, did not seem to have done anything that lived up to the proclamation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had proved himself capable enough now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If someone like this took over the reins at headquarters, perhaps we would no longer need to put up with all this nonsense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, this thought flashed into the minds of nearly all the White-robed Divine Guards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black lights flashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hundreds of demonic Black Guards appeared behind Purple Night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In contrast to their overpowering presence when they first made an appearance, they were trembling in fright now and did not dare to speak. Even though they might secretly be enraged or feeling vengeful, they did not dare to express those feelings on their faces. It was not because they were spineless, but rather, they had been shocked into submission by Ye Qingyu's reputation and methods. He had even destroyed all of their airships in the blink of an eye, and it was not impossible for him to slay all of them now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few other Black Guards transformed into flowing light and streaked in the direction of the divine temple of the Alliance of Domains, a great distance away from Blue Cloud Manor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, they planned to report this incident to headquarters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu placed his hands behind his back. His white robes were pristine and spotless, and his expression was calm now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He walked slowly toward Purple Night and the others. The experts of the Demon Race lowered their heads as he swept his gaze across them, none of them daring to look him in the eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Take this as a lesson for you. Those twenty airships are the price your race has to pay for interfering in our internal affairs on your own accord. Don't think that no one can handle you people during this time of peace in the universe. Remember that the Human Race is still surviving, and we are still formidable... Haha, if your headquarters is still not convinced, your superiors can look for me in the Heaven Wasteland Building. I'll welcome them anytime."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu pointed at the [Demon Sage] and said firmly, "You, stay. From now on, you have to sweep the floors of the Heaven Wasteland Building for a decade as payment for insulting and rebutting the Third Deputy of the Human Race. The other Black Guards should scram now. From today on, no Black Guard is to step within a thousand-meter radius of Blue Cloud Manor; otherwise, I'll kill them, regardless if they come from underground or the sky... Purple Night, do you accept these terms?"&nbsp;</span></p>
