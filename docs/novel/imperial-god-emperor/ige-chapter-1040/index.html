 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1040, The end of a Quasi-emperor</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperor Mushan was a man of great luck, who received the inheritance of a severed force of the God and Demon Age. Moreover his constitution was special. While trapped in a secret environment, he had achieved the Quasi-emperor realm after countless years of cultivation, and was considered a genius of the world. However, he had not been on this world for too long, thus his reputation was not particularly special. Adding to this, his cultivation base was achieved through self-cultivation, and although he had trained in the land of formations of the severed force, his actual combat experience was too little, his heart had not been through the hammering of battles and thus was not stable. This was Quasi-emperor Mushan’s biggest flaw in his martial arts. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, after Quasi-emperor Mushan came out of training, he came to the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor and went after the advantages. Due to his grudges with Ye Qingyu, he finally joined hands with the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect without distinguishing right from wrong, and had planted great evil karma. Even if he was a Quasi-emperor existence, the moment he was involved, it was absolutely difficult to detach from the battle. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are you?” Quasi-emperor Mushan stared at the old man with a puzzled gaze. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man smiled, “if you retreat, you will be safe, otherwise, in the midst of this heaven and earth calamity, you will not escape.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It's hard to quit when you're in it.” Quasi-emperor Mushan shook his head, making another move. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he lacked hammering and polishing, he was after all a Quasi-emperor. He also could feel the flow of the fate of heaven and earth, and had chosen to be involved in it, he chose his stance and it was too late to retreat. At this moment he did not have the slightest hesitation. Since there was no way forward, might as well step forward in large strides. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sigh, hundreds of years of cultivation will come to nothing.” The Quasi-emperor old man let out a long sigh, Emperor qi flowing all around him as he joined the battle. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His silver hair erupted in a blaze of light. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strands of hair and beard, suddenly as though they had turned alive, transformed into a number of silver dragons. Their silver scales were flashing like stars in the sky, and the clutch of the dragon claw seemed able to break celestial bodies. The dragons were breathing out silvery light that contained majestic Quasi-emperor power, engulfing the world and Quasi-emperor Mushan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A great battle had broken out. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The situation had turned into three against two. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the battle of life and death among the five great Quasi-emperors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was a little more relaxed, but his brows were furrowed tightly. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The injuries that [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] had sustained were too severe to the point that the others thought that he might collapse and die at any moment. Moreover he did not have an Emperor weapon in his hands, was fighting against two, and although he still occupied the upper hand, Ye Qingyu still did not have a very good feeling. He had always felt that a battle that involved the fate of various races would never be so simple. The arrival of the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor was like a fuse. The extent of the intensity of the explosion it triggered was unpredictable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The aftermath of the Quasi-emperor battle in the Void was becoming more and more oppressive. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spectating figures drew back again and again. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu activated the [Cloud Top Cauldron], protecting him and Lu Wei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arrogant youngster's face flashed a confident glow. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He glanced at Ye Qingyu, then at the divine battle among the five great Quasi-emperors in the distance, as if mumbling to himself but also seemed to be talking to Ye Qingyu, he said, “My grandpa is invincible, he will certainly win... in this world, there is no mountain that my grandpa can't climb past.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu did not respond. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strength of Lu Wei was ordinary, that is the pinnacle of the Saint realmm and not quite the Great Saint. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he was very young, two years younger than Ye Qingyu. This was his real age, rather than the transformation in physical state after martial arts success. He addressed the old man Quasi-emperor as grandpa, but the age seemed to not match, because the old man was at least tens of thousands of years old. However there must be a reason for this. It could be seen that the old man doted on his only grandson, and had spent a lot of effort to let Lu Wei achieve the cultivation base of the Saint realmm at such a young age. His foundation of martial arts was very solid and stable, and not like the younger brother of Quasi-emperor Mushan, leaving behind countless flaws because of rapid success. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even so, without the power of the old man, given Lu Wei’s strength, it would have been impossible for him to make it here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man Quasi-emperor brought Lu Wei here in the hopes that his grandson would see the most powerful forces in the world. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when Lu Wei said such a thing, Ye Qingyu immediately realized that the arrogant youngster had begun to worry about his grandpa. Only when one is not confident, the more one would say such self-deceptive words. After all, the opponents that his grandfather was facing were not Saint experts or Great Saints, but Quasi-emperors who had really stepped on the pinnacle of martial arts. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a blink of an eye, changes occurred again on the battlefield. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah...” a tragic scream came. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quasi-emperor Mushan's tremendous body was severed into two at the waist, suffering serious injuries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man Quasi-emperor looked like a deity had descended onto the world, his hair and beard had transformed into numerous silver dragons, breaking Quasi-emperor Mushan's dharma body, and like thousands of silver ropes, twisted around the broken body of Quasi-emperor Mushan, gnawing frantically. The scene was extremely shocking and terrifying. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandpa's going to win,” Lu Wei breathed a sigh of relief and cheered. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu also heaved a sigh of relief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The situation was smoother than he had thought. The strength of the old man Quasi-emperor was extremely terrifying, and Quasi-emperor Mushan was no match for him at all. &nbsp;</span></p>
