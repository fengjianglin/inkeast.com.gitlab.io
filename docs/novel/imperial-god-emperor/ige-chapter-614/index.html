 <p>Chapter 614, The third sword (2)</p>
 <p>The scarlet brilliance of the Blood Bone blade expanded, taking the form of a huge blade-shaped halo of light next to the bone blade, blazing fiercely. The surrounding space began to constantly distort under the blood-coloured flames.</p>
 <p>There was an incessant ruptured noise ringing in the ear, and after the distortion of space, the density of yuan qi in the space changed abruptly, triggering a small explosion caused by the ignition of the scarlet flame.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The next moment, the Ruthless Prince Mofeng swung his sword with a backhand motion into the air. The blood-coloured blade-shaped halo soared into the air, leaving a blade-shaped scarlet flame that blotted out the sky as it went whizzing toward Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>The blood-coloured blade-shaped flame engulfed the sky.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, the night sky seemed to have been incinerated by the red flame.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Where the flame passed by, all spaces turned to vacuum. There was not the slightest fluctuation of yuan qi or aura. The space was twisted, and blood-red flames adhered to the cracks in space. It was incredibly strange, like a will o’ wisp of the netherworld!</p>
 <p>Opposite.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu, under such an offense, like a small boat in a sea of blood, seemed extremely small and fragile.</p>
 <p>The scarlet flame almost engulfed Ye Qingyu in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But at this critical moment, Ye Qingyu acted.</p>
 <p>A force that was not considered strong was suddenly injected into the [Blood Drinker Sword].&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Buzz buzz.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Strange sword cries were heard.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The silent dark red markings on the [Blood Drinker Sword] all of a sudden came alive, like flowing lava, moving along the lines of the sword and gradually presenting a dazzling crimson red colour. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the crimson lines gradually lit up the whole sword body, the [Blood Drinker Sword], like a dormant ancient beast being awakened, its imposing manner abruptly soared. As the crimson markings covered the entire sword, a strong attractive force broke out from the sword blade. Countless cyclones visible to the naked eye formed around the [Blood Drinker Sword], rotating silently</p>
 <p>Something unbelievable followed——&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The corpses of the thirty Demon Spider experts who Ye Qingyu had killed were scattered disorderly across the ground. But during the moment of the formation of the countless cyclones around the [Blood Drinker Sword], dense and strange beads of red blood began to surface from these Demon Spider experts’ bodies, flying into the air to where the [Blood Drinker Sword] was</p>
 <p>Those beads of red blood were formed from the essence and blood of the Demon Spider experts!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The pure blood, qi, and energy formed into beads of blood were like raindrops flowing backward, and like a swallow returning to its nest, gathering towards the [Blood Drinker Sword].&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, beads of blood covered the sky like a rain of blood.</p>
 <p>The only difference was that the blood rain was assembling towards the [Blood Drinker Sword] in Ye Qingyu hand’s, flowing back toward the sky.</p>
 <p>The scene was both enchanting and bizarre.</p>
 <p>Everything happened at lightning speed, in less than the blink of the eye. The blood rain that filled the sky had all been absorbed by the [Blood Drinker Sword]!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Like an evil spirit, after feasting on the blood, the red lines on the body of [Blood Drinker Sword] were even more dazzling than before.</p>
 <p>Upon a closer look, those patterns seemed to have become deeper and clearer, and some of the originally blank areas on the sword body were developing with some new markings!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu cried into the air, drawing a deep breath.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was able to clearly feel the surging power of the [Blood Drinker Sword]. He satisfiedly activated the [Blood Drinker Sword], drawing up the purest life force.</p>
 <p>The majestic and pure life force passed from the [Blood Drinker Sword] and into Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>The numerous bone-deep wounds on his body began to shift, pink-coloured flesh was growing at a speed visible to the naked eye, a faint glowing colour shining in those wounds. But in the blink of an eye, Ye Qingyu’s whole body of wounds had been healed. There was not a trace of injury remaining.</p>
 <p>The fractured bones of his body were, under the supply of pure life force, also re-growing, springing up like spring bamboo after the rain, and becoming more sturdy and solid.</p>
 <p>In a brief moment, he had reached his peak state once again.</p>
 <p>The pure life force drawn from the [Blood Drinker Sword] was constantly cleansing Ye Qingyu’s body. For Ye Qingyu, it was as though it nourishing his meridians after a period of long drought. An indescribable joy could be felt from the depths of his soul.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Ye Qingyu whose clothes were stained with blood suddenly seemed like an immortal, remaining aloof from the world.</p>
 <p>He was seen gently raising his hand in a seemingly slow movement, but vaguely there was an ethereal feel.</p>
 <p>The [Blood Drinker Sword] was lifted high with his hand gesture, the sword tip pointing to the sky.</p>
 <p>Invisible sword qi silently spread out from the sword, leaving a clear ripple-like pattern in the air.</p>
 <p>The mysterious lines and markings on the body of [Blood Drinker Sword] flashed a lava-like bright luster, and between the flashes of light were sharp killing intent breaking out from the air.</p>
 <p>The blood-red bone blade had in the blink of an eye closed in on Ye Qingyu, but he swiftly swung the [Blood Drinker Sword] down at the oncoming monstrous flame in the direction of the Ruthless Prince Mofeng.</p>
 <p>With the wave of his sword, Ye Qingyu and the [Blood Drinker Sword] merged into one, transforming into a stream of red flowing light that shot out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The flowing light was like a huge red lightning that struck without the slightest warning, streaking across the horizon with a blinding red light.</p>
 <p>Boom! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>In that split second of the red lightning colliding with the light of the blood-red bone blade, an earth-shaking explosive sound ripped apart the vault of heaven.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The surging blood-coloured flame was like a thin piece of muslin in front of the scarlet lightning. The blade effortlessly cut a huge incision through it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everything happened at lightning speed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not leave any time to counter-attack or defend for the Ruthless Prince Mofeng</p>
 <p>The scarlet lightning, after the tearing of the veil-like blood light, did not show the slightest hesitation or pause, and struck in the direction of the Ruthless Prince Mofeng with a thunderous force!</p>
 <p>A fierce and blood-coloured gorge had almost split the Ruthless Prince Mofeng into two halves.</p>
 <p>The Ruthless Prince’s complexion wildly changed, eyes filled with disbelief, looking down at the huge [Blood Drinker Sword]. He still couldn’t believe that his body would be severed in one move.</p>
 <p>The man who was dying had wounded him?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pain!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bone-piercing pain!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Ruthless Prince Mofeng only felt that the pain that made him feel despair had drowned all his consciousness.</p>
 <p>A shudder from the depths of his soul was raging in the Ruthless Prince Mofeng’s heart.</p>
 <p>More to his despair, he was shocked to find that the blood red light of the ferocious gully was surging, but there was not a drop of blood. All the blood were accumulating toward the [Blood Drinker Sword].&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Ruthless Prince Mofeng could distinctly feel that the blood, qi, and life force of his body were madly being drained away at a terrifying speed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This is...”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A lightning flashed through his mind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Ruthless Prince Mofeng suddenly remembered that the [Blood Drinker Sword] had drank the blood of Luo Xie entirely, and at that moment, the blood of more than thirty experts had been cleanly absorbed by this huge strange sword.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This huge sword was bizarre, it was a demonic weapon.</p>
 <p>Buzz buzz.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As though it had felt the vigorous energy of the Ruthless Prince Mofeng, which belonged to the power of an Immortal Step expert, the [Blood Drinker Sword] automatically began to vibrate. Like a ferocious beast that had caught sight of a fat lamb. it was impatiently attempting to absorb the Ruthless Prince Mofeng’s blood, qi, and strength.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ah... Get lost!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Ruthless Prince was both terrified and furious, boundless fear and madness were erupting from his eyes.</p>
 <p>The next moment he began to struggle wildly.</p>
 <p>Discarding the blood-coloured bone blade to one side, Mofeng thundered, his left hand clenched into a fist, demon flames raged and wrapped the fist, and all his power was gathered in this one fist. With a loud roar, the power of destruction fiercely launched at Ye Qingyu who was still holding the stance of when he brought the sword down at Mofeng.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This punch was without any fancy gestures or showy moves.</p>
 <p>But it gathered all the power of which an Immortal Step Demon Spider Prince had in his lifetime, and was thrown at Ye Qingyu’s face in the most direct and primitive way.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu sneered.</p>
 <p>“Haha, it is too late to retreat now, feel the power of [Blood Drinker Sword].”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this time, he would never give the Demon Spider Prince any chance to open up the distance between them</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s right hand that was clasping the sword did not move a single jot, and at the same time he was operating the True Will of the Sky Dragon in his mind. His left arm flashed a silver brilliance, transforming into a huge dragon claw. At the very moment that his left arm was fully covered in dragon scales, the Ruthless Prince Mofeng’s huge fist was firmly wrapped in the dragon claw.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The powerful strength of the giant fist had only made Ye Qingyu’s dragon claw vibrate ever so slightly, and did not give the Ruthless Prince Mofeng any chance of escaping.</p>
 <p>Witnessing the punch that had concentrated the majority of his lifetime of skill and power being counteracted with no difficulty, the Ruthless Prince Mofeng, who could already feel the threat of death, was both fearful and furious, almost losing his mind. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ah ah ah, I’ll kill you!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He exhausted all his remaining yuan qi and energy to fight back.</p>
 <p>His limbs were wildly waving about, trying to break free. The tremendous force in the air was unstably roaming about, leaving countless space cracks in the void. And within a radius of hundreds of meters, there was an abnormal fluctuation of yuan qi, masses of black demonic clouds tumbling in the air, and there was a sudden howling of wind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Watching the fiercely struggling Ruthless Prince Mofeng, Ye Qingyu merely gave a cold smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Beast, I said I will kill you today. Accept your death.” As Ye Qingyu roared, he frantically operated the True Will of the Sky Dragon, sending a majestic and overwhelming qi exploding in the air.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The next moment, a terrifying scene appeared.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s lower body had unexpectedly, in the midst of the flash of silver light, transformed into a dragon shape.</p>
 <p>The huge dragon tail was covered with silver scales, full of an endless visual impact, like a tremendous silver rope. The silver dragon tail gently moved and had already tightly bound the body of the Ruthless Prince Mofeng.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>How terrifying was the power of the Sky Dragon.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Ruthless Prince Mofeng felt as though he was a fish that was desperately resisting, tangled up in a fishing net and could not break free no matter what.</p>
 <p>With just physical strength alone, Ye Qingyu could effortlessly trap the struggling body of the Ruthless Prince Mofeng in the dragon’s tail.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The [Blood Drinker Sword] was still inserted in his body.</p>
 <p>As time passed by, the Ruthless Prince was shocked to find that the strange giant sword had already swallowed nearly half of his power! ————</p>
