He ran rampant throughout White Mountain Black Water, without anyone being in his opponent, sitting firmly in his position within the [Berserk Horned army]. In these hundreds of years, he was one of the greatest martial talent that had the possibility of becoming Saint Mage of the White Mountain Black Water Brute Race.&nbsp;</span></p>

There are countless experts, and there are some existences that are never seen or heard of that have the power to suppress a race. They cannot be underestimated. Although we have gained the upper hand in the situation, but if the Human Race really made their determination to fight to the last breath, the victor or loser is not yet decided. Therefore, do not be too overboard in these days, understand?"&nbsp;</span></p>

Their limbs were cold. It would need the work of three or four days at least, before they could force the coldness out from their bodies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "We are the descendants of the Saint Mage of White Mountain Black Water. We bitterly struggle to live in the poor and barren land of the Brute Race, and have subsisted on nothing for many years. It is all done for today! It is absolutely impossible for us to kill all humans. As long as we are able to win the wealthy lands of the three great provinces in the North East, then we will have gained the ability to flourish and reproduce. In another fifty years’ time, the descendants of our Saint Mage will run rampant over Heaven Wasteland Domain. At that time, it will truly be the moment to rule over all..." There was a self-confident smile that appeared on Jin San, "The current human Snow Emperor, is only a fatty that has fallen into a trap, surrounded by all sides .This time, we will only cut off his flesh for us to eat but not kill him. We cannot force this fatty with strength still left to desperate measures. Listen to my orders, we will act more on the periphery these days.”</span></p>

His face was deathly pale, like a dead corpse with all it's blood gone. The previously powerful-like-a-dragon little giant could not even stand up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The ice sword Order of Light slowly floated up from his hands.

The Brute Race, under the aid of his comrades, was finally able to recover. Deeply breathing in, he could only feel there were like thousands of icy needles travelling throughout his veins and arteries, causing him extreme pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Lord..."

Like plucking flower with his fingers, he lightly flickered. A small faint gold kindling flew out, then flew back towards the Brute, towards the location of the injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "Bring Officer Jin Zheng away. After resting for ten days, he will recover." Jin San waited his mouth, "This matter is to teach you people a lesson. In the future, do not be so arrogant and don't cause trouble for me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Brute Race all promised their obedience and left their comrade who was injured outside the great tent.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; He slowly sat up from the bone chair, slowly taking steps forward. He came floating before the little ice sword. Smiling, he suddenly lifted his right hand. Without knowing when, his right hand had already transformed into a fiercely burning flame that firmly pressed towards the little ice sword flickering with ice qi light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly, within the great tent, the cold qi exploded yet again.</span></p>

It began fiercely quaking, as a hard to describe cold qi exploded. In an instant, nearly three of the fingers of Jin San's right hand was frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; On the four sides of the tent, there was the light of brute magic formations emitting. It was like many little blood-coloured little snakes, emitting a strange energy, that began to restrict the cold qi in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a scarlet red, that flashed by on Jin San's face, the fury in his eyes evident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, the Order of Light ice sword let out a noise and began cracking. It turned into a silver radiance that disappeared in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; Jin San's expression was extremely serious. Only after a while did it return to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; "It seems like I've underestimated him.”</span></p>

His martial strength should not be low. If I was to fight him on the arena, I must be careful. However, it seems this person is just brash, his view of the entire situation is too low. It will be hard for him to become someone important. Unless a person's strength reaches the extreme, it is difficult for them to affect the final outcome. If in the battle of two armies, on a battlefield with tens of thousands of soldiers, it is as easy as taking an item from my own pocket to kill this man.”</span></p>
