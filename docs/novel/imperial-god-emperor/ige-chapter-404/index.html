 <p>Chapter 404 - The Daughter of Lu Zhaoge</p>
 <p>Seeing that Ye Qingyu had finished the wine, the smile on the lips of the woman in white immediately widened, like a child who had just made a prank, laughing like blossoming plants swaying in the breeze.</p>
 <p>Yu Xiaoxing and Aunt Heng threw each other a glance.</p>
 <p>The former’s eyes were filled with astonishment and confusion.</p>
 <p>The latter’s eyes were equally astonished, shaking her head slightly.</p>
 <p>It was obvious that at this moment, Aunt Han was definitely not the person that they were familiar with. Today she was indeed a bit abnormal.</p>
 <p>In the past, let alone an ordinary little noble like Ye Qingyu, even if it was the Snow Empire’s Snow Emperor, as long as Aunt Han disagreed, it was impossible for them to enter this bamboo forest. Unexpectedly, today, for the first time, she let Ye Qingyu drink the [Drunken Immortal Wine] that she personally brewed, and also drink a whole jar.</p>
 <p>It should be said that [Drunken Immortal Wine] was really comparable to origin crystal, in that there is no market price and the materials used were all spiritual medicines and herbal ingredients collected from this ancestral land.</p>
 <p>This ancestral land was once a herbal medicine field of a top sect in the era of sects, and later was unknowingly transformed into an ancestral land by a war god of Snow Empire, and its terrain was changed. Under the protection of formations for hundreds of years, the ancestral land still maintained its original style, there have not been picking and destruction, and the spiritual medicines and herbal ingredients remained in perfect condition. In the ancient times, even members of the imperial family may not be allowed to pick the herbal plants, but Aunt Han could pick them as she wished, like she was pulling out radishes, and brew them into wine following an ancient method. For martial artists, this wine was simply a priceless treasure.</p>
 <p>Although Aunt Han treats such fine wine as ordinary alcohol, she was not at all stingy to the people close to her. But to outsiders, she would speak bluntly and harshly.</p>
 <p>Once there was a relative of the imperial family, taking advantage of the fact that the blood of the imperial family runs in his body, intruded the bamboo forest, and was directly killed by Aunt Han’s zither sounds and turned to smithereens.</p>
 <p>So today, at first, Yu Xiaoxing was hesitant to take Ye Qingyu into the bamboo forest.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, this time Aunt Han herself wanted to see Ye Qingyu, an outsider.</p>
 <p>That would have been astonishing enough.</p>
 <p>But now she even let Ye Qingyu drink all the [Drunken Immortal Wine].</p>
 <p>She said she threw it in the wrong direction, but from the beginning it was obvious that she was clearly aiming it towards Ye Qingyu?</p>
 <p>Xing’er angrily thought to herself.</p>
 <p>While Ye Qingyu was already feeling dizzy and his vision blurred. He could only feel countless heat currents flowing around his body like horses running wild, all muscles, bones, flesh and blood were burning, but there was no pain, and instead felt warm and comfortable, as if he had returned to his mother’s womb.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s sight was a little blurred.</p>
 <p>When he opened his eyes, the figures in front were seen overlapping into several layers of images.</p>
 <p>Vaguely, he seemed to have seen the white-clothed beauty Aunt Han. She came towards him step by step, stretched out her hand, gently stroked his head. There seemed to be glistening teardrops that flashed into those clear as autumn spring eyes, and then Ye Qingyu was too drunk, immediately falling asleep...</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>It was unknown how much time had passed.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was waking up in a confused state.</p>
 <p>He was slightly frightened until he suddenly examined the surroundings, realizing that he was lying on his back on the deck of the ship, reeking of alcohol. His hands and feet felt weak, but his body was full of strength and he felt an unprecedented comfort throughout his body.</p>
 <p>The unruly Princess Yu Xiaoxing was sitting at the bow of the ship with her feet in the air.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu sprang up, touching his head.</p>
 <p>The memory in his mind was seemingly real, but somewhat vague.</p>
 <p>Drawing a deep breath, Ye Qingyu rested on his stomach at the side of the ship, overlooking below. There were temples one after another, deity statues and magnificent temples. The sounds of chanting and smell of incense filled the air. It seemed that they had come out from the Imperial Ancestral Land, and into the outside the temple area.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked over at Yu Xiaoxing, who looked bored with her hand under her chin, asking, “How long has it been?”</p>
 <p>“Not long.” Xing’er casted a very strange glance at Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu breathed a sigh of relief, “Oh, good, good.”</p>
 <p>Xing’er then added, “Only two days and two nights have past.”</p>
 <p>“What?” Ye Qingyu suddenly jumped up. “That isn’t long?”</p>
 <p>Xing’er stared at him with a gaze like she was looking at an idiot. “The people that get drunk from [Drunken Immortal Wine] sleep for three or four months while you only slept two days and two nights, is that very long?”</p>
 <p>“But...” Ye Qingyu’s face darkened. “I will miss the allotted time of the military report.”</p>
 <p>“Oh,” Xing’er nodded. “I see. It’s not that important, although the army said that military orders cannot be disobeyed, but just by missing the allotted time, they won’t kill you.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu, “...”</p>
 <p>Xing’er sniggered out loud, “Well, it’s not that serious, so don’t worry. I have already told people to tell my brother, the Crown Prince, you can go a day or two later.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu, “...”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu felt he was almost tricked to death by this unruly princess.</p>
 <p>“Hey, seriously, have you seen Aunt Han before?” Xing’er moved closer, her eyes wide and unblinkingly staring at Ye Qingyu, with an extremely curious and nosy gaze.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu said snappily, “What do you think?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t think you could have ever seen her,” Xing’er answered with a perplexed expression on her face. “But why do I feel like Aunt Han’s attitude to you is too strange. She has never been so nice to others before.”</p>
 <p>“Nice?” Ye Qingyu couldn’t help laughing. “You think that forcing me to get drunk the first time we meet is being nice to me?”</p>
 <p>“Tut-tut...” Xing’er curled her lips contemptuously. “Look at your face like you’ve been mistreated. You’ve gained an advantage but pretending otherwise. Did you know that the first time I went, I just drank three bowls of [Drunken Immortal Wine]? Did you know that my older brother Crown Prince wants to drink this [Drunken Immortal Wine] but he can’t? Did you know...”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu proudly smiled.</p>
 <p>That wine really was something good.</p>
 <p>“Do you know that when you were asleep, Aunt Han was very concerned about you? She told Aunt Heng to take you to the Bamboo House of [Snow Peak Platform], even my father had not set foot there before, you know my father is Aunt Han’s older brother...” Xing’er blurted out.</p>
 <p>“What?” Ye Qingyu exclaimed in shock. “That Aunt Han is your father’s younger sister?”</p>
 <p>“I call her aunt, she is obviously my father’s generation of people, what’s so strange?” Xing’er looked at Ye Qingyu with disdain.</p>
 <p>“But...” Ye Qingyu felt that there seems to be something wrong and asked again, “What about that Aunt Heng?”</p>
 <p>“Aunt Heng is my elder, but she is not of the Yu clan.” Xing’er hesitated for a moment, before continuing, “In fact, this Aunt Heng and you have a little relation.”</p>
 <p>“Me?” Ye Qingyu was dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>Xing’er nodded, “You know Aunt Heng’s father.”</p>
 <p>“Ah?” Ye Qingyu was at a total loss.</p>
 <p>Xing’er smiled, “Guess.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu had nothing to say, but to entertain Her Highness Princess Xing’er, he said one or two names. Xing’er finally just laughed, “[War God of Youyan Pass] Pass Lord Lu, is the father of Aunt Heng, you couldn’t guess right?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was so shocked his jaw dropped.</p>
 <p>That gentle woman is the daughter of Lu Zhaoge?</p>
 <p>Why would the daughter of Lu Zhaoge be in the Iimperial capital, be at the imperial family’s ancestral land?</p>
 <p>Is it not said that those without the blood of the Yu clan cannot enter the imperial family’s ancestral land?</p>
 <p>“Aunt Heng started out as a maid of Aunt Han and grew up with Aunt Han. They have always been very close, and later something happened. Aunt Heng was involved in a calamity, and almost died. Aunt Han was furious and personally killed tens of thousands of noble experts of the Empire, blood flowed for thousands of miles, and even the current Right Minister was almost killed in that battle.” Xing’er sighed. “I don’t know much about this matter, after all. I was still small at that time. There are many things I have not personally experienced, and don’t remember clearly... But since then, Aunt Heng left Youyan Pass, followed Aunt Han and has been living in the ancestral land.”</p>
 <p>There was such an incident.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded slightly.</p>
 <p>It sounded like another mystery of the higher-levels of the empire, outsiders won’t know too much.</p>
 <p>But since Aunt Heng is the daughter of Lu Zhaoge, how was she involved in a calamity and almost died?</p>
 <p>Within the empire, there were indeed some that dared to touch the daughter of Lu Zhaoge, but they could absolutely be counted with one’s fingers.</p>
 <p>And this mystery also involves the most powerful Right Minister of the Empire today?</p>
 <p>“The reason I came here today, besides to pay respect to my ancestors and visit Aunt Han, was to bring a letter to Aunt Heng from Pass Lord Lu,” Xing’er explained. “In fact, Aunt Heng and Aunt Han are people of cruel fate. They both have someone they love, but can’t be together with him, are forever separated, and most likely would never see each other again in this life... Why would fate be so cruel to such remarkable women?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was speechless.</p>
 <p>This trip to the Imperial Ancestral Land, for him, was like a dream.</p>
 <p>About this vague past that Xing’er had mentioned, Ye Qingyu did not understand too much, but for some reason, when he thought of the two women of unsurpassed beauty in the ancestral land, Ye Qingyu could not help but feeling a burst of compassion and bitterness for them.</p>
 <p>From what Xing’er had said, these two women of unsurpassed beauty have encountered the ups and downs of love.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu also couldn’t help thinking of Song Xiaojun.</p>
 <p>The girl who had lost her memory, where was she now?</p>
 <p>“Don’t know why, but Aunt Han seems to give you special preferential treatment, she not only let you drink the [Drunken Immortal Wine], but also let you onto the [Snowy Peak Platform]. If words get out, it would most likely cause a storm within the imperial family, it is far more shocking than you using the [Three Thousand Feet of White Hair]...” Yu Xiaoxing stared at Ye Qingyu, “Why is that?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu very seriously thought for a moment, then said, “Is it not because of you? Doesn’t she also think that I’m your little boyfriend?”</p>
