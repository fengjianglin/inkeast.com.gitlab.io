 <p>268 - The secret behind domains</p>
 <p>Hundred herb hall, top floor.</p>
 <p>Dugu Quan had a faint smile on his face as he regarded Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"Do you believe it now. I already said, the commotion you caused that day was too great. There are some old bastards that absolutely would not be able to resist acting out after seeing such a scene. On the surface, although everything seems calm, but between the Empire and the sects, there were already many of such incidents where they've tried to erase our young prodigious talents. The hidden blades in the shadows is enough to make one shiver. There are many geniuses in this world, but there are only a few that can truly grow up. You have already attracted the attention of some parties, so you had best be careful."</p>
 <p>Dugu Quan grinned as he said such words.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's expression was calm as he nodded his head: "It's only that, I did not imagine they would be so reckless. To dare incite the wrath of the Youyan army, can we discover just who did such a thing?"</p>
 <p>"Difficult." Dugu Quan shook his head. "Since they dared to act, they must have made complete preparations. They've disguised their identity really well, it will be extremely hard to pursue them. And even if we discover who they are, then so what? In the eyes of the common people, the Imperial Court dictates everything. But in reality, the power of the sects is much stronger than what peoples believes. Although they are wary of the power of Imperial Court of Snow Empire, and won't dare directly confront them, but they will not be afraid of the investigations of the Snow Empire. Since ancient times, martial power is needed to control and restrict martial experts. But for those true Extreme Level experts, just how would they even care about the power of the Empire."</p>
 <p>"Extreme Level experts?" Ye Qingyu's eyebrow perked up, saying with surprise: "According to what brother Dugu says, could it be that there exists Extreme Level experts within the sects?”</p>
 <p>Above top level experts, were Extreme Level experts.</p>
 <p>Extreme Level experts were existences that had surpassed the Bitter Sea stage. According to legends, after leaving behind the shackles of Houtian, your very actions could distort reality. A breath can create an endless storm, they can breathe in and dry the ocean. They possessed an endless lifespan, everyone of them possessing the power to change the very landscape. They could be called truly invincible.</p>
 <p>Those existences that stood at the peak, were not powers that the Imperial authority could restrict.</p>
 <p>If there were such experts existing in the sects, than it was most likely that the Snow Empire would long have been destroyed.</p>
 <p>Unless....</p>
 <p>Unless there were also such experts within the Imperial Court of Snow Empire.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was frightened by his own conjecture.</p>
 <p>Dugu Quan shook his head.</p>
 <p>"This is had to say. When the Snow Empire it was founded, battle was everywhere, with the fires of war raging in th skies. Not only did it need to conquer all the major forces around, it also had to fight many battles with the sects located in Heaven Wasteland domain. There were thousands of sects in Heaven Wasteland domain, and it was said the Three Sects and Three schools, were not the true leaders of the sects at that time. There were some vast sects that had near a million of disciples, leviathanic entities. That was an era that truly belonged to the sects.”</p>
 <p>Dugu Quan had a nostalgic expression as he had recounted the tale.</p>
 <p>He was accomplished in the Pill Dao, and his cultivation was at the Biter Sea stage. He possessed great longevity and had experienced the long passing of time. Thinking back to the past, he could not help but sigh.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu silently listened.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not know much about the situation before Snow Empire was founded. There were very few texts regarding this within the library of White Deer academy. There were also pitifully few tales regarding such indidents. Before this, Ye Qingyu had never really heard of such matters.</p>
 <p>This was because Snow Empire had intentionally restricted the spread of such information.</p>
 <p>"Did you know, that the Imperial family of Snow Empire, were not people originally from Heaven Wasteland domain. They came from other domains." Dugu Quan seemed to have thought of something, repressing his voice and speaking in a mysterious manner.</p>
 <p>"Ah?" Ye Qingyu was taken aback.</p>
 <p>It was his first time hearing of such a thing.</p>
 <p>Outside the domain?</p>
 <p>"En, they came from other domains. This is a legend that is hard to prove, but what one can be sure of is that, Snow Empire did not exist a hundred and fifty years ago. There was not even a sect called the Snow Sect or anything alike. The Snow empire seemed to be a force that descended from the heavens and suddenly became prominent, dominating everywhere. In sixty years of time, it had crush many sects, and destroyed hundreds of forces. Ultimately it was able to establish an Empire in the human territory of Heaven Wasteland domain.“</p>
 <p>Dugu Quan seeing that Ye Qingyu seemed to be really interested in history, began recounting such stories in detail.</p>
 <p>In this world, there were three thousand different domains. Everyone of them was a different world. Heaven Wasteland domain was a relatively young domain, and there was still a large area that was still shrouded by mist, completely unexplored.</p>
 <p>There would often be gates that linked domains together.</p>
 <p>True Extreme Level experts using the remarkable abilities they had, could travel between domains without going through a domain gate. However, there were also powerful forces that could borrow the power of Dao tools and the like, to open a passageway, conencting to different domains. For normal experts however, they could only rely on the domain gates to travel back and forth from other domains.</p>
 <p>There was an extremely limited number of domain gates in each domain. Most of such gates were held in the hands of the top factions, being treated as a precious resorce. This caused there to be little interaction between other domains, making it seem that the domain was completely isolated.</p>
 <p>The rarity of these domain gates, also led to difficulties in invading other domains. Adding to this, the instability of the laws of the world in some domains, would cause experts of the other domains who forcefully entered into a domain to lose their cultivation, their strength dropping. They might even incite the punishment of a heavenly tribulation. Therefore those at the true Extreme Level , would not dare enter with their true body.</p>
 <p>The greatest value in interaction between domains, was that they could exchange cultivation resources and commodities.</p>
 <p>Commonly seen herbs, commodities and resources in one domain, perhaps would be regarded as an absolute treasure in another domain. Through such transactions, both parties could obtain vast benefits.</p>
 <p>That was the reason all the forces wanted to control such rare domain gates into their own hands.</p>
 <p>The birth of a domain was said to be the result of the natural flow of the creation force and laws. It was a natural formation of the power of the world. For a new domain to be born, this would require the opportune moment in long aeons of time. In the vast thousand worlds, it needed billions if not trillions of years for the birth of a new domains to occur.</p>
 <p>The domains of the Vast Thousand Worlds, was like a lifeform. It would be born, grow up, mature, stabilise, deteriorate, destruct. Everything followed a process. And according to the concentration of Spirit qi, the size of the domain, the wealth of its resources, the age of the domain, one could classify a domain into different grades.</p>
 <p>As he spoke to here, Dugu Quan said: "Heaven Wasteland domain can be counted as a new domain that is curretnly growing up. The laws of the world is still not entirely stabilised, so the martial power compared to those mature domains cannot be comparied. So if there really was a force from a Higher Domain that came from some sort of channel to here, and wanted to rule Heaven Wasteland domain, this would not be too difficult a task.”</p>
 <p>A thought flash in Ye Qingyu's head, he said: "You mean....the Imperial court of Snow Empire, could possibly be a force from a higher domain?"</p>
 <p>"This is one explanation, but it has no evidence to back it up or to determine whether it is false. Those who descend from a Higher Domain will be restricted by the laws of Heaven Wasteland domain. This is especially so for those domains who are yet to stabilise and are still in the midst of growing up. The restrictions on such domains are especially powerful, so the forces of other domains will not lightly descend." Dugu Quan said, not denying or ascertaining Ye Qingyu's thoughts.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not saying anything, remaining silent in thought.</p>
 <p>"There are two great races in Heaven Wasteland domain today, the Human race and the Demon race. But apart from this there is the Brute race, the Ghost race, as well as some other legendary beasts. Although they are in the extreme minority, without any authority whatsoever. It is said that there are ten domain gaites in Heaven Wasteland domain, four held by Snow Empire, three by the demon race, two by the sects, and one by the minor race....Only those who control a domain gate, has the power to speak to the other forces of the other domains.“</p>
 <p>Dugu Quan breathed in: "Controlling a domain gate is tantamount to controlling an escape route, a route to life. There are infinite possibilities. Even them, the Dugu financial organisation, one of the great families within Snow Empire, has never seen a domain gate before.”</p>
 <p>"In other words, since the Snow Empire controls four domain gates, their position should be unshakeable." Ye Qingyu said.</p>
 <p>"That’s is not entirely correct. The domain gates are dead, people are alive. There is not an impossible matter in this world as long as there is a will. Snow Empire was able to take the domain gates from the hands of other people, therefore other people can also take it back." Dugu Quan smiled: "Furthermore, Heaven Wasteland domain is a domain that is still developing and growing. It's possible there will be a new domain gate that will appear.At that time, this represents the balance will be broken.“</p>
 <p>"New Domain gates?" Ye Qingyu was taken aback."</p>
 <p>"Of course, domain gaters are interspatial corridors. Old domain gates can be extinguised, new domain gates can appear. Everything is possible." Dugu Quan stated in a manner that seemed as if everything was perfectly logical. "Since the founding the Snow Empire, we have conquested tens of thousands of miles and shed countless blood. Right now, it seems that we can coexist peacefully with the sects. But we have fought in great wars against them, the seed of hatred has already been planted. These years although it seems that all is calm between the Empire and the Sects, but there are still many conflicts in the shadows. Although it is not possible that a full scale war will break out, but there are many smaller scale battles that could occur.</p>
 <p>"Thank you brother Dugu for telling me so much." Ye Qingyu gave his thanks sincerely.“</p>
 <p>This was the time Ye Qingyu had heard of such an explanation and such secrets.</p>
 <p>Hearing Dugu Quan recount everything, Ye Qingyu had a feeling that everything became clear at once.</p>
 <p>Dugu Dixiu and Dugu Tianxin stood side by side, their hands at their sides respectfully.</p>
 <p>There were also faint signs of shock written on the vestiges of the Dugu brothers.</p>
 <p>Evidently it was their first time hearing of such secrets from their grandfather.</p>
 <p>At that same time.</p>
 <p>In the rear courtyard of the Hundred herb hall store, Jin Ling'er and Li Qi and Li Qi were busy practicing martial arts. Mother Wu was bustling in the country, where the kitchen emitted a dense fragrant smell. It attracted the works of the Hundred herb hall to stare at the direction of the kitchen while dripping saliva.....</p>
 <p>That night, the storm raged on at Youyan Pass.</p>
 <p>The news that White Horse tower had been destroyed, spread throughout Youyan pass, like it had grown wings.</p>
 <p>The army reacted instantly.</p>
 <p>The surroundings of the White Horse were placed under complete lock.</p>
 <p>The Pass Lord's Residence also sent out experts, investigating the place and continuing to search for clues.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu, the favourite of the people, was currently missing. There were many people discussing such a question but there was no other information forthcoming.</p>
 <p>Time quickly passed in such hustle and bustle.</p>
 <p>The second day, the weather was good.</p>
 <p>A blue sky, gentle warm sunlight. This really was rare good weather.</p>
 <p>The Proud sky centre became the centre of Youyan pass.</p>
 <p>There were power formation arrays within and outside of Proud sky centre that was flickering. The sects and the army had acted togther. According the rumours, even if it received the full power strike of an extreme level expert, then it is possible for it to survive.. There is a massive formation array stage within the courtyard. He had already made his preparations. he did not know just how much blood of these young heroes would splatter on this stage.</p>
 <p>The matters of Jianghu, will be settled in Jianghu.</p>
 <p>Thsi was the large trap that the Sects digged. They wanted to use the method they were used to, to solve some tricky matters.</p>
 <p>As the first ray of sunlight illuminated the fake mountains of the Proud sky centre, the curtains to this event gradually opened-----</p>
