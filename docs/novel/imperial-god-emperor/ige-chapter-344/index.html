 <p>Chapter 344 - Pay respect to Marquis Ye</p>
 <p>This tone was clearly reprimanding Wu Xi.</p>
 <p>But it was also like a master scolding a servant.</p>
 <p>Wu Xi’s face instantly cooled down.</p>
 <p>He was about to clench his teeth and say a few fierce words when, in the distance, there was a few streaks of light flashing, arriving above the thatched house. The light landed, turning into a few figures, strong yuan qi emitting from their bodies. The leader of these people was wearing a silver armour, like dragon scales, imposing and magnificent, and behind him stood four guards. His strength also seemed much stronger than the previous two low-ranking generals.</p>
 <p>“Lord!”</p>
 <p>“Pay respects to Lord.”</p>
 <p>Two low ranking generals hurriedly jumped down from their white horse and respectfully bowed.</p>
 <p>The silver scale armoured high ranking general waved his hand, without saying anything, then cupped his hands at Wu Xi who had an ashen complexion. “Young Master Wu, I heard you have trouble?”</p>
 <p>Wu Xi’s face was instantly clearer and brighter than before.</p>
 <p>“So General Guan had arrived, good. I ran into a few thugs today, they dare to kill in Weicheng City, and have killed my 21 personal guards. General Guan, this group of thugs is very arrogant, brutal and ruthless. They are absolutely not something good. General Guan, please help me settle these thugs.”</p>
 <p>Wu Xi clenched his teeth and snarled.</p>
 <p>Guan Shandu nodded, and did not speak.</p>
 <p>Just now, he had received the news that the two lower ranking generals had secretly sent out, informing him that in Donkey Tail alley, military experts have appeared and things were likely to involve a military Marquis. As a commander of the Weicheng City Patrol Camp, although Guan Shandu was surprised, he did not neglect the matter in the slightest and hurriedly came at the first instant.</p>
 <p>As a commander of the city patrol, Guan Shandu was definitely ranked in the top five greatest figures in Weicheng City, but he was not of noble background. Especially compared to a military Marquis who was granted the rank of nobility by the empire, he was very far away in status.</p>
 <p>How could he not be alarmed when the city patrol troops were involved in such an incident?</p>
 <p>Guan Shandu’s gaze swept across the few people opposite, feeling apprehensive.</p>
 <p>Liao Xiongyi’s family. Guan Shandu vaguely recognized them. This period of time, the news that Wu Xi caused the Four Seas Merchant Company to go bankrupt and ruined their family had reached his ears. But such a small matter, he did not take it to heart. In this world, the weak are prey to the strong, this sort of incident has happened too many times in the past few decades. Although Guan Shandu despised Wu Xi’s conduct, but he did not want to, because of such a matter, offend such a vengeful influential official.</p>
 <p>But the three young warriors by Liao Xiongyi’s side, Guan Shandu could see the problem at one glance.</p>
 <p>Only a true soldier was able to see the kind of iron will and indomitable spirit exuding from a soldier’s body.</p>
 <p>As someone who had been fighting the Demon Race on the battlefield, Guan Shandu could obviously tell the extraordinariness of the three Youyan soldiers.</p>
 <p>And when his gaze once again fell on the body of Ye Qingyu, there was a hint of doubt within his eyes. He slightly knit his brows in a frown, but the next moment, he immediately thought of a name and he jerked slightly. His eyes wrinkled up, and then putting him together with the rune formation portrait that he had seen on the imperial military bulletin, he immediately understood something.</p>
 <p>Heavens!</p>
 <p>This God of Death had come to Weicheng City.</p>
 <p>Wu Xi’s gang of people, this time, had really kicked a steel plate.</p>
 <p>The more Guan Shandu thought about it, the more he felt terribly scared and uneasy.</p>
 <p>When he glanced at the three soldiers, Guan Shandu was almost certain that the three soldiers must be from Youyan Pass.</p>
 <p>Only in Youyan Pass, a bitter cold frontier fortress, was it possible to cultivate such a valiant warrior, iron-willed, and calm as a boulder. And if these three soldiers came from the Youyan Pass, then the identity of the white-robed youngster quietly sitting there was obvious.</p>
 <p>Guan Shandu cast a glance behind at the two low ranking generals, a burning anger in his heart, and an impulse to tear these two guys to pieces.</p>
 <p>Usually when you follow Wu Xi and stir up trouble, I can turn a blind eye, but today you caused such a disaster and put the whole patrol camp in great danger. This is really a big crime. I absolutely cannot forgive these two idiots.</p>
 <p>He made up his mind that if he could get through the present crisis, he must go back and reorganize the patrol camp.</p>
 <p>Guan Shandu took a deep breath, controlling his myriad of thoughts, and took a few steps forward. Under the astonished gazes of everyone, he bowed and cupped one hand in the other respectfully, saying in a clear and loud voice, “Weicheng city’s Patrol Camp Commander Guan Shandu pay respect to Marquis Ye.”</p>
 <p>Behind.</p>
 <p>The two lower ranking generals and the hundreds of soldiers of the city patrol immediately felt a strong chill passing over their body and their legs began shaking uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>Wu Xi was stumped for a moment.</p>
 <p>He thought that the arrival of Guan Shandu would surely settle these thugs, but...</p>
 <p>And opposite, Liao Xiongyi and his family, after the huge shock, finally gradually came to understand something.</p>
 <p>They were now finally certain that second son Liao Tian’s friend was not as they had imagined before, a common ordinary little soldier, but a very influential and important high official, that even the Weicheng City Patrol Commander had to bow and pay respects to him.</p>
 <p>Such a discovery made the little trace of light in the Liao family’s heart suddenly become incomparably bright.</p>
 <p>The sun in the sky suddenly became roasting hot.</p>
 <p>Sitting on the chair, indifferent and calm, Ye Qingyu’s eyes also fell on Guan Shandu’s silver scale armour, lightly responding, “You know of me?”</p>
 <p>The attitude of Guan Shandu was incredibly respectful. “Marquis Ye’s impressive military achievements in Youyan Pass has spread all over the world, the military imperial bulletin was constantly issued like snowflakes. I had been fortunate once to see Marquis Ye heroic bearing on the imperial bulletin.”</p>
 <p>“Oh.” Ye Qingyu nodded.</p>
 <p>“Since you know my identity, then take your people back, this matter is not something you can deal with.” Ye Qingyu’s tone of voice carried an irresistible firmness and majesty.</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Guan Shandu immediately knew that the little Marquis who was famous all over the world, was really furious this time and would not easily let Wu Xi and the other people off.</p>
 <p>Guan Shangdu slightly hesitated for a moment, then cupped one fist in the other hand and said loudly, “Marquis Ye’s orders, I dare not disobey.”</p>
 <p>Once he finished speaking, he turned around and issued a military order.</p>
 <p>The several hundreds of soldiers that were surrounding this place immediately turned around, the front became the back, retreating out of the alley like the tide. In the twinkling of an eye they disappeared completely.</p>
 <p>“This Guan Shandu, the soldiers he trained are decent, but he is not strict enough. If he does not change this point, sooner or later he will encounter many problems.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded lightly.</p>
 <p>The huge alley that was packed with huge crowds of people before immediately became empty.</p>
 <p>There was only Wu Xi left behind.</p>
 <p>And also the 22 dead bodies on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Are you coming over to drive?” A Youyan soldier bellowed.</p>
 <p>Wu Xi quivered slightly. Clenching his teeth, he said in a malicious tone, “Do not go that far... ask Liao Xiongyi, if young master I drive, would the old man dare to sit on it?”</p>
 <p>“This...” Liao Xiongyi also looked distressed.</p>
 <p>Although he hated Wu Xi and wanted him dead, but he dared not offend this playboy. After all, a strong dragon cannot repress a snake. Although this Marquis Ye had helped him take out his anger today, but there would inevitably be a time that he has to leave, and once Marquis Ye leaves, Wu Xi could torment him all he liked. The ending would be much more miserable.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu smiled, “Uncle don’t worry, I will take care of everything.”</p>
 <p>His voice fell.</p>
 <p>Youyan soldier Gao Qui’s figure flashed, kicking Wu Xi off from the horse and pulling his precious big black horse over. He found a firewood cart, slightly tidied it up, built a few seats, and covered the sides with a rough piece of cloth. Then he helped the Liao family onto the carriage.</p>
 <p>They did not allow Wu Xi to speak, like a chick was carried onto the driver seat, and threw him a whip.</p>
 <p>“Drive the carriage, dare say another word, I will take your life,” Gao Qui threateningly warned.</p>
 <p>Wu Xi originally wanted to say a few words, but as soon as he saw Gao Qui’s pair of ice-cold eyes that were like an ice machine, he immediately felt terrified. After what he had been through just now, Wu Xi knew that the power on the other side was not little at all. He was ruthless and was never reluctant to kill, but if he really did say another word, he was afraid that he would follow housekeeper Zheng’s footsteps.</p>
 <p>His heart was turned upside down, but he dared not say a word.</p>
 <p>“Drive!”</p>
 <p>Sitting on the driver seat of the carriage, Wu Xi snapped the driver’s whip at his precious black horse and the carriage started forward.</p>
 <p>The carriage slowly started.</p>
 <p>The three Youyan soldiers closely followed behind the carriage.</p>
 <p>In the time it takes to burn a stick of incense, the carriage finally came out of Donkey Tail alley.</p>
 <p>In the shadows and corners of both sides of the street, in the windows and doors, there were countless eyes furtively watching the scene. They did not think that Wu Xi, who came here with skilled masters and soldiers, would ultimately be captured like a slave and was driving a carriage. Countless eyes were flickering with shock and excitement.</p>
 <p>There was no one that did not hate this young master.</p>
 <p>Something huge was going to happening in Weicheng City.</p>
 <p>The carriage rumbled slowly down the street.</p>
 <p>Wu Xi clenched his teeth, kept his head low, driving towards the direction of Spring Street.</p>
 <p>“Damn it, damn it, how dare you insult me so much. I must take revenge, I will not let this matter go, what bullshit Marquis Ye. Wait till my uncle comes here. Is the military that strong? As soon as I send a piece of paper to tell my brother, you won’t be in the military anymore!”</p>
 <p>He cursed in his mind.</p>
 <p>On the street, people were weaving in and out.</p>
 <p>At first, nobody noticed anything.</p>
 <p>But gradually, someone noticed something wrong.</p>
 <p>What’s going on?</p>
 <p>The man driving is wearing silk?</p>
 <p>And seems a little familiar?</p>
 <p>Why does he look like [First Young Master of Weicheng City], Wu Xi?</p>
 <p>No way?</p>
 <p>Wu Xi is driving other people?</p>
 <p>On such a simple looking carriage?</p>
 <p>Look carefully, heavens, it really is Wu Xi, really is Wu Xi.</p>
 <p>What’s going on?</p>
 <p>Who is sitting in the carriage?</p>
 <p>When one person recognized him, others began discussing in whispered tones, and suddenly everyone was paying close attention. Countless eyes, countless gossip, and countless fingers were on the simple wooden carriage.</p>
 <p>Countless people have gathered.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere of the whole street instantly changed.</p>
 <p>At first, there were only a dozen of people, then hundreds of people, and then thousands of people were crowding around the carriage, following the carriage, pointing and discussing. There were people that were astonished, people in disbelief, and people that were rejoicing in his misfortune...</p>
 <p>Wu Xi’s heart was on the verge of exploding.</p>
 <p>He had never been so humiliated.</p>
