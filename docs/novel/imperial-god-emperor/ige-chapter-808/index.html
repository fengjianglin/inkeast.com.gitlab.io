Although by doing so they would fan the flames of his anger, this could also be proof that they had indeed suddenly attacked the Heaven Wasteland envoy mission. These two people had been important characters in the envoy mission. And although they had been deliberately disfigured beyond recognition, Ye Qingyu had identified them immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not difficult to deduce that many traps had probably been laid out at the representative station at the moment, with countless experts lying in wait. The Black Moon Divine Palace must have spared no expense laying out an elaborate trap that was bound to kill him if he were to rush in rashly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To capture a big fish, one must abandon the bait.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the thought of that happening, Ye Qingyu completely calmed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned to look at Shuang Wuyan and asked, "Elder Shuang, what should we do now?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu had not run out of ideas to deal with the grim situation they faced, but rather, so many ideas had flashed through his mind that he found himself unable to decide how they should proceed in order to launch a safe rescue mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His concern had clouded his judgment, and so, even the usually calm and collected Ye Qingyu was uncertain of his next move. He looked toward Shuang Wuyan since this elder was more experienced and familiar with the Alliance of Domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Let's wait a little longer."</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu nodded.</span></p>

He found it hard to tamp down the killing intent in his heart and he knew that he had to do something as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thirty minutes later, there was another commotion from the representative station.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of the gates of the Black Moon Divine Palace's representative station—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone carried something out and soon after, another head was hung from the Black Moon pole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu's heart dropped.</span></p>

However, upon closer inspection, despite his matted hair and clotted blood, Ye Qingyu recognized that head as that of Left Minister Qu Hanshan. As one of the important men of the Snow Empire, Ye Qingyu was familiar with how Qu Hanshan looked and thus recognized him straight away. It was truly his head and it was not a decoy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Has Qu Hanshan also been killed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This goddamn Black Moon Divine Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu started to shake all over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt as though every single one of his pores was spitting fire. The rage and killing intent threatened to consume him and he had a sudden impulse to destroy everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Black Moon Divine Palace..." Ye Qingyu ground his teeth so hard that an audible grinding sound could be heard. His voice rumbled forth like fire as he completely let himself be consumed by anger. "I swear that I will destroy this entire sect and wipe it from the face of this world. I swear that I will destroy its gates and that I will make sure that the Black Moon Divine Palace's existence will only be found in history!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, he turned to look at Shuang Wuyan and said, "I'm about to do something and I won't need your help in this. Please help me carry out a task that is very important. If you manage to complete this task I've entrusted you with, I will live. If not, I will vanish from this world alongside the Black Moon Divine Palace."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shuang Wuyan looked at Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could tell that Ye Qingyu had already made up his mind and there was no further room for discussion. After spending these few days with him, Shuang Wuyan had to admit that this young man was the most remarkable Heaven's prideling he had encountered throughout all the domains. Ye Qingyu was outstanding in all aspects, so he believed that even though Ye Qingyu was consumed by rage, he was still capable of sound judgment and would not rashly court death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, what would you like me to do?" Shuang Wuyan nodded. "I will definitely accomplish this task as long as I don't die."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">......</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Mister Zhu, we have set up everything according to your instructions." The elder in charge of this representative station, Zheng Hong, reported as he saluted a thin, middle-aged scholar with a black beard who held a rainbow fan made of feathers from a divine bird. "I have already displayed the three heads that you have brought."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Alright, I understand. Tell everyone to remain on their guard and prepare to act according to plan once Ye Qingyu makes his appearance."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Hong nodded and left the hall to disseminate Mister Zhu's instructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Will Ye Qingyu really take the bait and show himself?" one of the five Great Saints asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Of course, I have it all planned out." Mister Zhu waved his fan, full of confidence. He smiled proudly and continued, "Of course, as long as everyone present follows my instructions and refrains from acting rashly and the middle segment goes smoothly, we will definitely be able to capture this bastard from the lower domain. Then, it's up to you how you want to deal with him."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hmph." One of the Saints scoffed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire representative station was now under the control of Mister Zhu and even the Saints had to act according to Mister Zhu's instructions. It was said that the palace master had been very unhappy with the current situation and thus sent Mister Zhu to oversee everything here. Mister Zhu was not part of the Black Moon Divine Palace, but the reason he had been entrusted with such an important mission was that he had defeated the rest of his competitors to become the master of the personal disciple of the Black Moon Divine Palace—Yang Wanqu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some people were willing to submit to this calculating Mister Zhu, who was only at the Immortal Step realm, while some were not willing to submit to him. Even within the Great Saints, there were some who disapproved of Mister Zhu's presumptuous attitude. But since no one dared to defy the palace master's orders, they could only submit to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the opposite side, Great Saint Zhong Yuan sat in repose with his eyes closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked as though he had no interest in the happenings of the foreign domain, but instead, he had his own concerns. At his age, unless he had heaven-defying progress in terms of his martial cultivation and managed to find himself on the emperor's road, all his efforts would come to naught. Therefore, what he was most concerned about was not his own lifespan, but whether the Black Moon Divine Palace would be able to reach a period of great prosperity.</span></p>

Zhong Yuan had not thought much of Yang Wanqu, but after his return from the 18th district of the Black Demon Pool, he had improved by leaps and bounds, defeating the rest of his competitors to become the personal disciple of the Black Moon Divine Palace. His current standing within the Black Moon Divine Palace was only second to the palace master and would be an extraordinary successor to the palace master in the future.</span></p>

Logically speaking, since he was Yang Wanqu's master and Yang Wanqu was a candidate he admired, all should have been well. Mister Zhu had also shown that he was doing his best to support Yang Wanqu, but because Mister Zhu was not a disciple of the Black Moon Divine Palace, Zhong Yuan felt that something was off about Mister Zhu.</span></p>

Otherwise, if I determine that he has ulterior motives, I will definitely kill myself,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Zhong Yuan thought.</span></p>

He was so overcome with excitement that he lost his composure and loudly announced, "Mister Zhu, Elder Zhong, and the rest of the Saints, he has appeared. He has truly appeared..."</span></p>

One of the Saints rose to his feet and stared hard at Zheng Hong. "Speak clearly. What is the urgency?"</span></p>

Zheng Hong knew that he had lost his composure earlier on and continued, "Ye Qingyu has appeared. This bastard from the lower domain has indeed made his appearance. He is currently cursing outside the manor and declared that he will take those three heads away with him."</span></p>

Ye Qingyu has let me down, I guess I had thought too highly of him earlier." Mister Zhu laughed, his face filled with disdain. He rose to his feet and said, "Let's go, everyone. The rest of you are up next. If you don't have the confidence, then it would be safer to lure this bastard into our trap and capture him thereafter."</span></p>

He held the three heads that had been displayed on the poles moments earlier, his body trembling and his eyes shining with tears, as he muttered, "To the two kings, please blame me for my incompetence in preventing your deaths. However, I swear to you that the Brute Race of the Heaven Wasteland Dynasty will flourish and thrive and will no longer be enslaved. Left Minister Qu Hanshan, as you watch from the heavens, I will avenge your death and destroy the Black Moon Divine Palace."&nbsp;</span></p>
