 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1088, The Empress chamber</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark aura in the Dragon cave gradually dissipated away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark soul of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor had been sealed, the formation present could no longer function, as a result those Dragon Human Race skeletons that had crawled out of the grave and were no longer suppressed by the [Cloud Top Cauldron], also went still and lifeless, and lost consciousness. The eyes of the four remaining Dragon Human Emperor corpses were flashing red, but they did not charge over again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white Bone Dragon Bloodworm Puppet roared excitedly, absorbing the dark aura in the air in big mouthfuls. This power, to it, was like nutrients. It was born with the ability to devour and assimilate, and did not have to worry about being affected by the dark forces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu appeared beside the Dragon Human Emperor. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty doesn’t look too good,” Ye Qingyu said, taking out a Deathlike Pill, “Take this pill, it will relieve your symptoms.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you Mister Ye Qingyu.” The Dragon Human Emperor did not hesitate to take the pill, and immediately a gush of heat began circulating around his body, powerful life force spread out and poured into his bones and limbs. Although unable to move his body, he could still clearly feel that his body was rapidly improving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty is too polite.” Ye Qingyu smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Deathlike Pillwas precious, but was still just an object. After this battle, he and the Dragon Human Emperor had become allies, and only a living ally can bring out his real value. Moreover, after this battle, Ye Qingyu could already tell that the current Dragon Human Emperor was indeed a hero, and even if it was only for this battle he was worthy of a Deathlike pill.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu swept his gaze across the Dragon cave and noticed the four ancient Dragon Human Emperor corpses. After a thought he directly stored them into the [Cloud Top Cauldron], sealing them together. These ancient corpses had been refined using a secret dark method and it was impossible to remove this dark force; therefore, they would only become a calamity later on if left alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The current Dragon Human Emperor recounted what happened during the battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was inwardly shocked when he heard this. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It turned out that there were so many secrets in the death of the Supreme Emperor. He was convinced by the heroic courage and lofty quality of the imperial family of the Dragon Human Race, and in order to fight against darkness, did not hesitate to sever the imperial bloodline. The eight Emperors of the Dragon Human Race had, at the risk of their life and soul, fought against the demons. It was impossible to make such a choice if they were not heroic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Human Race deserved to be called a great race that had once dazzled the Vast Thousand Domains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu operated a secret formation to completely remove the remains of the dark formations in the Dragon cave and to speed up the dissipation of the dark force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white Bone Dragon Puppet Bloodworm followed behind Ye Qingyu, like a little beast looking forward to food.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu knew what it wanted——&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark spirit of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the Puppet Bloodworm swallowed the dark soul of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor, then its power, cultivation base, insight and experience, would skyrocket. But to what extent, even Ye Qingyu did not know. It may even leap to become a half-step Quasi-emperor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu, after a thought, generously took out a little dark spirit of energy to feed to the Puppet Bloodworm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark spirit of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor was so great that, if he were to feed to the Puppet Bloodworm all at once, then it would most likely be the one being swallowed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slowly, Ye Qingyu hoped that after devouring all the spirit of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor, the Puppet Bloodworm would digest the memory and information and find out why the dark creature had to kill Ren Puyang at all costs. It was clear that it did not simply want to kill him and make the Human Race plunge into chaos. There was definitely a deeper reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu already had a plan in mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the matters of the Dragon Human Race was finished, he planned to take a trip back to Heaven Wasteland Domain, then immediately rush to the dark domain, to clarify the matters regarding the Phoenix Race and the Unmoving City of Darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu had a hunch that all his puzzlement, the origin of the dark creatures, as well as even the mysteries of his parents, would be revealed in the dark domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The palace of the Dragon Human Race.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuexin was anxiously pacing back and forth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The little dragon girl was worried about Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mausoleum of the Dragon Human Race was where many important people of the Dragon Human Race were buried. It could be said to be a world of the dead, there were big secrets, and also great dangers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the bodyguard commander was extremely calm and quiet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But inwardly he was also extremely anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a trusted aide of the Dragon Human Emperor, he knew that he was the only one who knew about today's operation besides the Dragon Human Emperor and the other six experts of the Dragon Human Race. If anything were to happen to the Dragon Human Emperor, if he were unable to get out of the mausoleum, then he really had to follow the previous plan discussed. He had to quietly take the Prince, Princess, as well as the important heirs to the Dragon Tooth Army.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once that happens, the disaster of the Dragon Human Race really would be coming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most likely, from then on, the Dragon Human Domain would be reduced to a dark area, becoming an outpost station for the dark domain to enter into the Vast Thousand Domains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a bodyguard who had guarded the Dragon Human Race palace for hundreds of years, he really did not want to see such a situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed by.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had already been three hours since the Dragon Human Emperor entered the dragon tomb.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several batches of ministers had come to ask to see the Emperor, but were all sent away by the bodyguard commander under different excuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wore an anxious expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a voice travel into his ear. The bodyguard commander’s face lit up at once. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;“Your Majesty and the others are back, we should hurry over to see them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Overjoyed, he came to the emperor's hall with Zhou Yuexin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, he saw the figure of Ye Qingyu and the Dragon Human Emperor coming out of the secret passage under the dragon throne.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dragon throne slowly closed up, sealing the Dragon cave. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mister!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two gave a surprise cheer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty, Lord Lin and the others...” the bodyguard commander asked subconsciously when he saw that the other six experts did not show up. Most of all, one of them was his father. Worried, he could not help asking them on the spot. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Human Emperor sighed. “Lord Lin and the others fought to the death, and are now sleeping in the dragon mausoleum.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bodyguard commander gave an extremely mournful sigh upon hearing this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fortunately, with Mister Ye Qingyu's help in this battle we have finally ploughed up the enemy's court and completely eradicated the problem that had troubled my Dragon Human Race for more than hundreds of years. Although we suffered a heavy loss, we finally see light. I have already formed an alliance with Mister Ye Qingyu, and with the help of Heaven Wasteland Domain, in less than ten years my Dragon Human Race will restore the vitality of the past.” The Dragon Human Emperor was a little weak, but his voice was still filled with excitement. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Congratulations, Your Majesty.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bodyguard knelt down and congratulated him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, deliver an imperial decree to immediately begin the cleaning operation, pull out all the dark piles in my Peerless Dragon City, and order people to pass a message to General Xu Wuya that everything has been settled, all our plans can be put into effect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Human Emperor said confidently. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” The bodyguard commander was similarly extremely excited, but once he calmed down, he noticed that the Dragon Human Emperor's condition did not look too well. “Your Majesty, you are okay?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha, don't worry, I can still sit here for another ten years.” The Dragon Human Emperor’s voice sounded incredibly energetic. With the Deathlike Pill, although he had previously burned the origin source and the qi of the emperor, his life would be without danger for another ten years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bodyguard was shocked when he heard it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Human Emperor was at the prime of his life, and was one of the strongest martial arts expert of the Dragon Human Race. He should have had thousands of years of life, but now... ten years... it was evident what sort of price the Emperor had paid for this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other side Zhou Yuexin immediately thought of Ye Qingyu, staring at him with her beautiful eyes she asked, “Mister, you...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu shook his head and reassured, “I'm fine.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next three days, there was a rain of blood over Peerless Dragon City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many spies that various forces had arranged in the city were strongly pulled out by the Dragon Human Emperor——The Dragon Human Emperor had already seen through everything before, but it was that his energy was all placed on the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor. Now that the problem had been lifted, his hands were free, he planned to thoroughly eliminate all enemies with thunderous force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu also took action during this period.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some of the aristocrats in the city who had secret ties with the loose alliance were also uprooted. Many of the ancient families of the Dragon Human Race were also turned to ashes in the flames, and a huge amount of wealth was transferred to the hands of the imperial family. 一</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the army that the Dragon Human Race imperial family controlled was more frequently dispatched.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without the constraints of the Great Ancient Dragon Emperor, the Dragon Human Emperor could finally have his hands and feet unfettered, and he ambitiously wanted to become the Lord of the Dragon Human Race’s revival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the first decree that the Dragon Human Emperor issued was to identify the Human Race as equal citizens of the Dragon Human Domain, and to be treated equally. This was naturally in order show goodwill to Ye Qingyu, but at the same time also to lay the foundation for the cooperation between the Dragon Human Race and Heaven Wasteland Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three days later, Ye Qingyu left Peerless Dragon City alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuexin stayed in the imperial palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This little dragon girl was adopted as the daughter of the Dragon Human Emperor, and her status greatly increased. Adding to this the Dragon Human Emperor had promised to marry Zhou Yuexin with her sweetheart of the Human Race. The little dragon girl finally got what she wished for to be together with the one she loves despite her family's opposition.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Wasteland Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snow capital.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Empress Yu Xiaoxing was standing on the stone steps in front of the palace hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She stood there, lost in thought, overlooking the view below.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This location had a panoramic view over the whole palace. Complemented by the red Empress robe and gold-plated crown, the empress's skin was fair as jade, face incomparably delicate and beautiful, and radiated a noble, cold and majestic air, that would make any man surrender, but there was also an uncontrollable desire to conquer in the bottom of the heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether it was identity, status, strength, beauty or elegance, the present Yu Xiaoxing was like a goddess of the Ninth Heaven.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the years, there had been various rumours, and many people wanted to know what kind of man could match up to her, a goddess-like noble existence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The empress had been on the throne for several years, and the affairs of the empire were stable, but there still wasn’t a male heir. Without an heir, for the empire, was not a good thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There had been ministers that thought that the marriage of the empress should be put on the agenda for the stability of the Empire, but the empress simply laughed it off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Later, there were ill-intentioned people trying to flatter the empress in an attempt to enhance their status, and proposed to choose someone from the common people to fill the empress's chamber. It was only when the infuriated empress punished these people that this unhealthy trend was restrained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in fact, the people who really came from that era, such as Lin Zheng and other old ministers, were clearly aware that the empress’s heart had already belonged to someone. Moreover, in the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain there was only the existence in the Light Palace who was able to match the empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, this existence kept a low profile and most of the time was not in Heaven Wasteland Domain. Moreover, coupled with the deliberate concealment of the stories about him, there were less and less people that know about his existence in both the imperial court and among the common people. The past events were regarded as nothing but rumours.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty, there is a message from the Light City that Lord Ye Qingyu has returned.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smile bloomed on Yu Xiaoxing's face.&nbsp;</span></p>
