 <p>364 - Turn you into a corpse in the gutters</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu grabbed at him, saying, "Don't tarry here too long with these people, first let's save the person. Do you know the person called Qiu Fenghan?"</p>
 <p>[Avalanche] nodded his head. "That's right, she is one of the military heads of the backline operations of the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] army..."</p>
 <p>“If you know, then all is good. Follow me... my brothers, I'll leave the matter below to you. Protect the corpse of this little brother, do your best not to kill anyone," Ye Qingyu said something, his figure flashed. He directly headed towards the direction of the five or six noble figures rapidly. In an instant, he was in front of these figures and walked down through the hallway.</p>
 <p>"Scram away."</p>
 <p>An enraged yell.</p>
 <p>A blade light exploded out from the fifth floor, that struck to kill everything in front of it. It's aura was extremely vicious.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu let out a cold snort. Within the air, he grabbed and held this sword light.</p>
 <p>The glimmer from the sword light retreated, it was a long steel blade.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's figure charged forward. With a movement of his palm, and a ping, the long blade was snapped in pieces.</p>
 <p>The person who threw the sword was namely the other expert bodyguard next to Young Master Du.</p>
 <p>His face was filled with shock and astonishment. He could only feel a powerful force that came along with the broken sword. His figure could not help but fly backwards.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's figure landed.</p>
 <p>[Avalanche] also landed next to him.</p>
 <p>"Find her." Ye Qingyu gave [Avalanche] a glance, and said in a low voice.</p>
 <p>[Avalanche] nodded his head. He directly pushed open the doors of the private rooms and began searching one by one.</p>
 <p>"Quickly stop, you dare..." the manager who had once welcomed the noble young master in green clothing suddenly charged forwards to block him, attempting to detain him.</p>
 <p>"Scram away!"</p>
 <p>[Avalanche] gave him a slight shove and the manager was sent flying.</p>
 <p>"You are." Within the five or six noble young masters, there was someone with a furious face. Pointing at Ye Qingyu, he said, "Just who are you, to dare to be so mannerless in front of us. Do you know who we are?"</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not say anything. His consciousness slowly spread out around everywhere, surveilling everything around.</p>
 <p>"Hmph, daring!" That noble young master shouted. "People come... what are you doing, capture him, capture him. Whoever dares resist, kill them."</p>
 <p>There were two bodyguards that charged over.</p>
 <p>The light of the blades were like lightning.</p>
 <p>The glimmer of the swords was like a projectile.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stood where he was. Casually extending his hand, he grabbed the blade and sword with his hand. With a slight exertion of strength from his fingers, that blade and sword was crushed into scattered powder and sent flying backwards. Those two bodyguards that were around the sixty Spirit springs or so of cultivation, had no way of blieving the hilt that had left from their weapons. Their expression was like they had just seen a ghost, not daring to near and scrambled backwards in a panic.</p>
 <p>Using his flesh and blood body to crush the weapons in their hands. The difference was too evident already, it was really really too great.</p>
 <p>Within the capital, just when had such a young expert appeared?</p>
 <p>The two bodyguard experts were not nameless people. In their brain, there were the names of countless famous experts that instantly flashed by, but none of them were similar to the handsome young man before their eyes.</p>
 <p>"You're not allowed to retreat, kill him for me," the noble young master said angrily.</p>
 <p>Xiu!Xiu!Xiu!</p>
 <p>Immediately, another five or six experts charged forward.</p>
 <p>Evidently, these young masters all originated from famous families within Snow Capital. They had exceptional background. What followed behind them were also top class Spirit spring experts. If they were elsewhere, or within the Jianghu, they would have long been famous experts. When they acted, a killing aura was like a hurricane that swept over, heading towards Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu let out a sigh.</p>
 <p>For these people to reach the cultivation they did today, just how much effort and how much resources did they expend? Their original talent was decent, and if they used all that they learnt to protect the Human Race and fight against the alien races, they could contribute to the great duty of defending their homeland and to the flourishment of the Human Race. But it was a pity that people of such ability would willingly be ordered by nobles. For gold and silver, for status and power, they would abandon the pride and dignity of a martial artist, and did not distinguish from right and wrong. What difference did their actions have from a begging wild dog?</p>
 <p>With a faint will of his heart, his finger acting as a sword, he swiped casually.</p>
 <p>The will of the [Human King Sword Mantra] faintly activated.</p>
 <p>A sharp, peerless invisible aura began emitting from the flat of his palm.</p>
 <p>Ding!Ding!Ding!Ding!</p>
 <p>The broken swords flew everywhere, the snapped blades madly danced.</p>
 <p>The six experts that were charging over only felt a lightening of their hands. When they lowered their head to look, they could only see the weapons in their hands was as if it had been sliced apart by a divine weapon. It had been entirely cut apart.</p>
 <p>"How is this possible?"</p>
 <p>Someone exclaimed.</p>
 <p>Since they had willingly sold their lives to noble families, the weapons in their hands was naturally rare divinely sharp weapons. They were all Spirit class weapons. Why did it snap into two if the opposing party just lightly swiped?</p>
 <p>"Who are you? Please give us your name."</p>
 <p>Of the six experts, the middle-aged man that was the strongest opened his mouth. His tone became much more respectful.</p>
 <p>Such a level of expert was definitely not unknown.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu acted as if he did not hear.</p>
 <p>Bang!Bang!Bang!</p>
 <p>He had already kicked open the doors of five or six of the private rooms, but [Avalanche] had still not yet discovered Qiu Fenghan's figure. There did not seem to be any clues or suspiciousness on the guests in the private rooms.</p>
 <p>"I can't find her, what should we do?" [Avalanche] seemed worriedly impatient.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's gaze landed on the private room behind the several noble young masters.</p>
 <p>He deeply breathed out and headed towards the door.</p>
 <p>"Stand where you are." Young Master Du's complexion changed. Biting his teeth, "Young man, you must consider carefully. Your strength is perhaps very strong, but you must know that personal power does not represent anything. There are countless people with greater strength than you. Listen to my advice, if you leave today, I can pretend that nothing happened. But if you dare trespass over that door, then you cannot bear the responsibility.“</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu stopped his footsteps, his gaze landing on the face of this young noble master.</p>
 <p>The faint smile on Young Master Du's face was both self-confident and certain.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's lips curved in a slight smile. Without delaying slightly, he barged right through them.</p>
 <p>The surrounding air suddenly seemed to boil The experts as well as the noble young masters in front of him suddenly felt as if an invisible mountain had pressed against them. They could not block him in the least and was sent stumbling backwards.</p>
 <p>"You dare, you are looking to die you little brat..." a noble young master said in rage.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not respond at all.</p>
 <p>"All move aside, let him pass." Young Master Du bit his teeth, a sinister killing intent on his face. " I want to see just what kind of daring fellow, to think he would act against my Du household. If he really steps past that door, then I will make his corpse lay on the gutters in the south tomorrow.“</p>
 <p>He had gone completely all out.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Young Master Du had said such words, those who were familiar with him knew, that this matter could not end peacefully.</p>
 <p>The managers that rushed here after hearing the news were shaking from fear.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu did not pay attention to this in the least. In front of the crimson red door, he pushed and the door opened.</p>
 <p>Xiu!</p>
 <p>The instant the door opened, a dazzling swordlight struck out to kill from the crevice of the door.</p>
 <p>There was a sword expert that hid behind the door, that had finally struck with the most terrifying attack.</p>
 <p>"[War God], be careful." The expression of [Avalanche] changed. He knew that he was no longer in time to act.</p>
 <p>The expert of the sword that ambushed, his strength was around the eighty Spirit springs. He had hidden and gathered his energy for this strike, it was exceedingly terrifying.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu's complexion did not change. He did not even lift up one of his hands.</p>
 <p>A silver light emitted from the silver hairpin on his hair. It clashed directly with this dazzling sword light.</p>
 <p>There was a strange energy that exploded. The swordlight instantly froze, turning into ice. Even the person behind that was holding the sword was frozen at the same time, turning into an ice sculpture, his sinister killing expresion frozen on his face. His body and sword, could not even advance an inch further.</p>
 <p>Walking past the ice sculpture with a calm expression, Ye Qingyu arrived at the number one private room.</p>
 <p>The fragrance of wine assaulted him.</p>
 <p>Tens of female dancers shivered as they looked at Ye Qingyu entering.</p>
 <p>Compared to the glorious and rich decorations of the hall of the first floor, the arrangements of the number one private room was incomparably classic. There was running water as well as plants. Under the enhancement of the formation array, it was like a flourishing spring scene, causing one to feel relaxed.</p>
 <p>"Where is she?" [Avalanche] quickly came over, his face dark as he swept his eyes over. "She's not here."</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu frowned.</p>
 <p>"How is it, have you found the person you want?" Young Master Du had squinted his eyes as he faintly smiled. "To dare intrude on my private room and to injure my guards. You two things won't be able to bear such a crime…”</p>
 <p>Before he had finished.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu suddenly sensed something and grabbed at something through the air.</p>
 <p>There was a peculiar ripple on the wall tens of meters away. Suddenly a shapely figure with her clothing in disarray fell from the wall.</p>
 <p>So there was a space formation behind the wall.</p>
 <p>"Department Head Qiu?"</p>
 <p>[Avalanche] was able to recognize this shapely figure at first glance. She was namely one of the four requisitioning officers of the [Whip of the Thunder Deity] army, the person titled the 'Flower of the Thunder Army', Qiu Fenghan.</p>
 <p>Currently, Qiu Fenghan's clothing had already exposed half her body. It exposed her white jade like hand, as well as her translucent jade like long legs. She seemed to be powerless, and in a state that was half conscious. A faint fragrance emitted from her lithely figure. Under the shine of the formation light, she let out a white radiance like she was white jade, and she had a beautiful outline that was enough to make one faint.</p>
 <p>"Department head Qiu, are you okay?"</p>
 <p>[Avalanche] took out a cape from his interdimensional storage, and covered the exposed portions of Qiu Fenghan's body.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu extended his hand as he felt Qiu Fenghan's head, then was rest assured. "She has only ingested some sort of medicine that seaed her yuan qi." As he said this, a shred of [Supreme Ice Flame] went into her body and negated the effects of the [Sealing Yuan Pill] completely.</p>
 <p>But Qiu Fenghan still did not wake up-----</p>
