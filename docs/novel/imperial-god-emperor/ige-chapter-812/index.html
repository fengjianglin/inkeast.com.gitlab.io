If Ye Qingyu had only scattered a few embers into the representative station earlier, then this time, he had truly unleashed the heinous flames that now consumed the entire representative station and the surrounding dozen kilometers. The experts from the various races who had been lured by their greed into the area were not spared and they were all caught in the flames of the Hellfire.</span></p>

Several lower-level Saint experts were the first batch to catch on fire. They struggled with all their might and used all sorts of methods, including treasures and magical artifacts, to extinguish the [Red Lotus Hellfire] that consumed them, but to no avail...</span></p>

It burned not the physical body but the karmic debt accumulated by the soul. Therefore, as it burned, it did not release the typical nasty burning smell, but instead, released the scent of incense burning, as though heavenly maidens were scattering blossoms. The scene was both tragic and beautiful and would be seared into the memory of those who had witnessed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Ah...." a cry rang out.</span></p>

His achievements had once astounded a small part of the universe and he had dictated the destinies of countless people, but ultimately lost his life to the burning flames. He turned into ashes and disappeared into the Void.</span></p>

No one knew how badly his physical body had decayed, but nonetheless, he could still unleash terrifying power. As he shot up into the air, the mist surrounding him transformed into a shadow of a fiendgod. He was following the principle of destroying the leader first to bring about the destruction of the [Red Lotus Hellfire]. He thought that if he could kill Ye Qingyu, who was controlling the Hellfire, he might stand a chance to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Haha. Old fool, since you've arrived, I'll send you back to your death. How could you be so greedy when you're just a bag of bones?" Ye Qingyu bellowed and aimed the [Cloud Top Cauldron] at the elderly expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu was extremely calm and collected. He spat out a mouthful of essence and blood onto the [Cloud Top Cauldron], and a bronze-colored radiance burst forth from the cauldron. It buzzed as it vibrated and the ancient drawings carved on it seemingly came to life. One by one, these figures seemed to walk from the body of the cauldron and a mysterious force from the laws of the Great Dao bellowed. This scene was extremely bizarre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Boom!"</span></p>

His black mane danced in the wind as though a black radiance twirled through the sky, and his eyes were filled with rage and killing intent, just like the moon and sun hanging in the sky. As he surveyed the scene below, he gave off a formidable aura and resembled a fiendod who had the power to control the entire universe, looking down on the sand and dirt beneath him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Ah..." a surprised yell rang out from the grey mist. Those who heard it shuddered because it sounded just like two decaying pieces of metal grinding against each other. It did not sound like anything that should come from the soul of a Saint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grey mist vibrated violently and plummeted down a few hundred meters like a candle blowing in the wind. It only managed to stop its fall two to three breaths later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You bastard. Cough..." He coughed a couple of times before that malicious voice sounded once again, "You might be young but you are highly talented. Hehe. Your physical body seems to be in good shape. I've decided that I'll take that body of yours. Even if you're protected by rare charms, you will not be able to escape death today. Hehe."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he spoke—</span></p>

As the rank and pungent aura of a decaying body burst forth from the bloody mist, the large skull of an evil ghost could vaguely be seen. It was a mysterious sight to behold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It's the Blood Demon!"</span></p>

Ah, I know. He might have failed to break through and instead has incurred punishment from Heaven and sustained serious injuries. Is he now attempting to make a last-ditch effort to possess Ye Qingyu's body and be reborn again? This ability to take possession of another's body to extend his lifespan is the unique magical ability of the Blood Demon."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I can't believe this demon has appeared. We're in trouble this time."</span></p>

The Blood Demon was extremely famous. In his peak, it was said that he was immortal and he was almost impossible to kill. Furthermore, he was cruel and ruthless and none of the super forces dared to trifle with him. No one had expected him to show up in this place today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu was really unlucky.</span></p>

Even though the Blood Demon had failed to break through to the Quasi-emperor realm and had incurred punishment from Heaven as a result, he still had cultivation in the peak Great Saint realm and had run amok over the world for many years. His techniques were extremely cruel and vicious and he was extremely hard to overcome. The [Red Lotus Hellfire] might not even be able to trap this demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Void—</span></p>

Young punk, now you know who I am. Haha! Be a good boy and hand over all the goodies you have and I'll make an exception this time and spare you from torture. I'll make sure you die an instant death..." The blood-colored mist remained suspended in the air like a sea of blood and roared crazily toward Ye Qingyu as it attempted to swallow him within it.</span></p>

I'll make sure I knock you down dead." Ye Qingyu laughed maniacally and his eyes gleamed like fiery flames. He remained completely unafraid and operated the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. As it turned, a bright yellow mist circled around it. Ye Qingyu jumped into the cauldron, and under his control, instead of retreating, the cauldron shot toward the blood-colored mist.</span></p>

He would still make the same decision even if his current opponent was not a Great Saint but a Quasi-emperor.</span></p>

No, how could this be? How could your cauldron... be so powerful?" An astonished cry rang out as the Blood Demon seemed to have encountered something he had not thought was possible.

The moment the flames brushed against it, there was a crackling sound and it released a pungent smell as it turned into a watery grey mist. As the [Red Lotus Hellfire] continued to burn, the watery mist turned into ashes and disappeared into the Void.</span></p>

It wailed mournfully and everyone was surprised to see that it was a blood-colored bat in the shape of a pig. Its wings were overlaid with blood-colored scales, its red bones were spiked with needles, and furry needles covered its body like divine radiance. The [Red Lotus Hellfire] on its body grew more violent as it caught the wind and immediately enveloped the creature as it turned into a fireball.</span></p>

However, in less than four breaths, the Hellfire had utterly consumed it and turned it into a pile of ashes.</span></p>

The Blood Demon's overconfidence has cost him his life."</span></p>

After the death of the Blood Demon, their lives were in great peril. As horrified yells and wails rang out, dozens of people were turned into dust as the Hellfire licked their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Junior, do you intend to kill everybody?"

I'm only returning the favor. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. You say that I'm ruthless but this is nothing compared to the ruthlessness displayed by the Black Moon Divine Palace." Ye Qingyu laughed coldly and his killing intent surged. He then tossed out all the [Red Lotus Hellfire] he collected from the 18th district mercilessly.</span></p>

The experts down below who had charged into the representative station had all been after the treasures he possessed and every one of them had evil intentions. Other than those from the Black Moon Divine Palace, there were also those malicious monsters who had been in hiding. These people were like a pack of hyenas sensing blood, and once they sensed an opportunity, they would not hesitate to kill him. If they had discovered him in the Void earlier on, they would have killed him without hesitation and plundered his treasures. If he let them off today, they would definitely come after him in the future, either covertly or overtly, to steal his treasures.</span></p>
