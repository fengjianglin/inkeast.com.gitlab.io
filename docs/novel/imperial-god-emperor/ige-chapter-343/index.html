 <p>Chapter 343 - To Live Or To Die?</p>
 <p>Wu Xi came here with a stomachful of pent up anger, and when Housekeeper Zheng was slaughtered like vegetables being cut up in front of him and so many generals and skilled masters, his rage almost erupted out from his mouth and eyes.</p>
 <p>With his order, the Jianghu Masters that were guarding the passage and all sides of the roof immediately had a change in expression.</p>
 <p>The reason that the Wu household was spending a lot of money to keep them, was it not just to protect their family, the house and his people?</p>
 <p>Now, the problem was that Housekeeper Zheng was killed in front of him and the other people, and he and the others have not had the time to attack back.</p>
 <p>This was the same as hitting their face in public.</p>
 <p>“Young master Wu, you say, to die, or to live?” A horse-faced Jianghu master spoke out, his face forming a fierce scowl.</p>
 <p>The other tens of Jianghu Masters were just as fierce looking, waiting for young master Wu’s order.</p>
 <p>They were the people of Jianghu, they had seen blood and had killed; they know what to do at this time. Perhaps the few young men were soldiers, and possessed skilful moves, but even if so, so what? Even if the sky fell down there was young master Wu, a powerful and influential person to support them, what is there to be afraid of?</p>
 <p>“What do you mean to live?” Wu Xi was almost going crazy. “Kill them, kill all of them... Yes, that bitch,” he pointed to Liao Cui, saying ruthlessly, “Not unwilling to follow me? I want you guys to play with her to her death in front of her parents.”</p>
 <p>There was a vicious tone in his voice.</p>
 <p>“Young master’s words, you all heard right?” The horse-faced Jianghu Master said coldly, “Kill, kill these dregs of society, don’t let them die too happy.”</p>
 <p>All the others began laughing sinisterly.</p>
 <p>Swords and blades were unsheathed, as they slowly approached.</p>
 <p>An invisible pressure suddenly closed in on them like they were being crushed.</p>
 <p>Liao Xiongyi and his family were suddenly deathly pale like snow, and a huge fear had sent their body trembling violently.</p>
 <p>The terrifying Jianghu Masters that the Wu household raised were all extremely famous in the city, they have killed and set fire. All these years, they have committed many crimes, and many innocent people have died in their hands. Adding to this, several Jianghu warriors and righteous heroes were slaughtered by them, and their corpses were hung at the city gate exposed to the sun, suffering abuse and humiliation.</p>
 <p>Falling in the hands of these people would simply be a living death.</p>
 <p>Liao Xiongyi’s mind went completely blank. He was trembling as he tried to stand up to beg for mercy, when a hand slowly landed on his shoulder.</p>
 <p>It was Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, Uncle Liao, that trash, I can deal with.” From Ye Qingyu’s eyes, there was a mysterious force that abruptly calmed Liao Xiongyi.</p>
 <p>“Marquis Ye, how do we deal with them?” A Youyan soldier asked.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu said indifferently, “Since they want us to die, then we also want them dead.”</p>
 <p>The three soldiers nodded their heads. “Roger.”</p>
 <p>Clang!Clang! Clang!</p>
 <p>Swords flashed out of the sheath.</p>
 <p>The swords were the standard battle swords of the front line troops of the Youyan Army, forged from refined steel and combined with a trace of mysterious material. The swords were incomparably tough and durable, and can cut through iron like mud. The swords were the famous demon swords. The cold tip of the blades were wandering indefinitely like the autumn waters, exhibiting a bloody killing intent, as though the essence was diffusing out from the body of the three Youyan soldiers.</p>
 <p>“Kill!”</p>
 <p>A loud bellow.</p>
 <p>The three Youyan soldiers began to attack actively.</p>
 <p>The blade light was like a giant fabric of silk streaking across the sky.</p>
 <p>A battle instantly broke out.</p>
 <p>The horse-faced Jianghu Master in front felt a chill directly striking towards him. He was startled, and the huge sword in his hand was subconsciously sealed.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Yuan qi erupted with a thunderous sound.</p>
 <p>The sword in the horse-faced man’s hand cracked and exploded, debris flying out like a confused butterfly.</p>
 <p>His body was propelled across the air, slammed into a thatched cottage, and the thatched cottage collapsed and buried him.</p>
 <p>At the same time, blood spurted out.</p>
 <p>The three Youyan soldiers, like tigers stepping on a flock of sheep, directly attacked the Jianghu Masters that surrounded them and swept all obstacles in the way.</p>
 <p>The three soldiers were the elites selected from the frontline camp, and each one of them was at least a 20 Spirit spring master, and had fought countless times on the battlefield. Whether the three people cooperated or fought individually, it was to the extent that reached the peak of perfection, and far beyond the same level martial artists. One glance of their murderous spirit that was developed from fighting armies of thousands of men and horses was enough to make the opponent feel instantly terrified, and their will to fight would melt like ice and break like tiles.</p>
 <p>While the Jianghu Masters that were raised by Wu Xi perhaps had once wholeheartedly and courageously walked Jianghu and had killed and seen blood, but they were now like house pets that have been raised for too long. Their fighting spirit had faded long ago and their strength also unknowingly degenerated from being immersed in pleasures.</p>
 <p>To ordinary experts, they may be a terrible presence.</p>
 <p>But to the three Youyan soldiers, they were just like a group of lamb.</p>
 <p>Blades glistened.</p>
 <p>Fresh blood spurted out.</p>
 <p>“Ah...”</p>
 <p>“No...”</p>
 <p>Tragic screams echoed across the air.</p>
 <p>The three Youyan soldiers’ figures, like the gods of death, were constantly flickering and cutting off lives as though they were harvesting grain. Wherever they passed, there was not a single enemy left. The so-called Jianghu Masters, along with their weapons, were split in two.</p>
 <p>Liao Xiongyi stared wide-eyed, and even his breathing seemed to have stopped.</p>
 <p>His wife and daughter behind him were squeezing their eyes shut, afraid of seeing such a terrifying scene of killing.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s face was devoid of expression.</p>
 <p>These were the Jianghu Masters that have been raised by Wu Xi, each and every one of their hands were stained with the blood of innocent people. They had been helping a villain for too long, and absolutely do not have the glory of a martial artist. For scum like that, their death was not to be regretted.</p>
 <p>In the time of ten breaths.</p>
 <p>The sword light settled.</p>
 <p>Drip drop drip drop.</p>
 <p>Drops of blood from the blood groove of the Youyan’s demon blade trickled down to the ground.</p>
 <p>The three Youyan soldiers moved in unison as they used the lapel of their robe to wipe away the blood on their blade, insert into the sheath, and returned and stood behind Ye Qingyu without a word.</p>
 <p>But the scene in front was more shocking than saying thousands of words.</p>
 <p>Wu Xi’s teeth were clattering, unable to believe what he was seeing.</p>
 <p>The expressions of the two high-ranking generals of the city patrol camp by his side abruptly turned bewildered and uncertain. The insider knows the ropes, while the outsider just comes along for the ride. As soldiers, while they were standing in astonishment, they could vaguely tell that the three Youyan soldiers clearly displayed the martial arts of the military. The way they advanced and retreated in unison was evidently a quality only possessed by elites that have underwent intensive training.</p>
 <p>And who is the handsome young man in white that the three men listen to?</p>
 <p>Marquis?</p>
 <p>Heavens, is that boy a military Marquis?</p>
 <p>The two generals of the city patrol immediately felt that something was wrong.</p>
 <p>If this matter really involved a military Marquis, then this was not something that two little generals of the city patrol could take the responsibility upon themselves.</p>
 <p>When the shouting and screaming were finally settled, Liao Xiongyi, who was trembling all this time, was suddenly quiet and calm. Behind him, Liao Cui mustered the courage to open her eyes, and the scene made her extremely frightened, and also incomparably excited. Looking at Ye Qingyu’s broad shoulders and figure from behind, the beautiful woman suddenly felt that there was nothing to fear.</p>
 <p>“Second elder brother, can you see from the heavens? Your friend came to help us, brother...”</p>
 <p>Liao Cui could not help but burst into tears.</p>
 <p>The scene was somewhat silent.</p>
 <p>For a long time, no one dared to speak.</p>
 <p>Only the three horses were snorting.</p>
 <p>Suddenly————</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>A beam of cold light exploded from the side of the thatched hut and shot up, separating the grass and rocks, and launching right towards Ye Qingyu who was sitting quietly.</p>
 <p>The horse-faced master who was propelled across the air before was glaring with a ferocious look on his face, clasping a flashing dagger tight, like a flying fish, shooting across at an extremely fast speed and launching a sneak attack.</p>
 <p>This unexpected change, no one would ever have thought of.</p>
 <p>The three Youyan soldiers attempted to block the attack, but it was too late.</p>
 <p>“Ah ah ah, die.” The horse-faced master grinned.</p>
 <p>Since they could not win against the three Youyan soldiers, then why not kill the young leader. That way they would certainly win young master Wu’s recognition. In his eyes, this white-robed young man who was as beautiful as jade, looked so young and without the slightest fluctuation of yuan qi within him, must certainly not know martial arts.</p>
 <p>But———</p>
 <p>Before the dagger in his hand had penetrated within 5 meters of the youngster in white, an invisible force gushed forth, and the naked eye could visibly see the tip of the sharp dagger instantly turning into a fine powder, while his body was sent flying, slamming against a thatched hut.</p>
 <p>“Uh... ugh... You?” The horse-faced master was struggling to stand up, spurting out blood that was mixed with fragments of internal organs.</p>
 <p>With a face of disbelief he screamed, “You... You... What the hell is this? Master... The real master... I admit defeat... You... Just who are you?”</p>
 <p>Yes, who the hell was he?</p>
 <p>At this time, every single person present wanted to ask this question.</p>
 <p>Not only Wu Xi, the officers of the city patrol and the hundreds of soldiers, and even Liao Xiongyi and his family also wanted to ask this question.</p>
 <p>If they werent an idiot, then they could clearly tell that the situation was gradually beginning to reverse.</p>
 <p>Wu Xi’s side was not occupying a dominant position at all.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu had no intention of answering.</p>
 <p>He was just sitting there quietly, like an immemorial sacred mountain, not shaken, not watching intently, and was only looking up.</p>
 <p>“You... who the hell are you? Tell me your name, I am the Wu family’s Wu Xi, my uncle is the Weicheng City Lord, my father is an official registrar, my brother Wu Yan is the [Crafty Eagle] of the [Cold Blooded Thirteen Eagles] under the command of the Right Minister.” Wu Xi bit his teeth. “I am not someone who will be afraid just like this. Since we have bumped into each other, why don’t you come here and we can become close with each other.”</p>
 <p>Wu Xi’s attitude, compared to when he first arrived, was a lot gentler.</p>
 <p>But Ye Qingyu didn’t even glance at his direction.</p>
 <p>“What are you, do you think you can talk to our Marquis?” The soldier called Gao Qiu of the three Youyan soldiers sneered and replied disdainfully, “Our Marquis had told you long ago to come over here, and drive the Liao family to Spring Street. Where is your vehicle?”</p>
