He was about to curse, but then he saw the government attire on Gao Han. His complexion immediately changed, "Perhaps you do not know, but the [Matchless Blade King] Qin Zhishui has appeared. He has killed countless Brute Race soldiers in West city. right now, all parties has been disturbed, and the patrol camps and the military has sent out experts that are currently working to capture him.”</span></p>

It must be the Brute Race in the West city asking for their own deaths by setting up an arena. It was unknown how they had incited this reaper of death. The rumour said that Qin Zhishui hated the Brute Race the most. In these days, outside the capital, he had killed many Brutes in the three great provinces of the North East.&nbsp;</span></p>

To think that they would go kill such an iron blooded man for those Brute Race that deserved to die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; As he thought of this, he quickly came to the outside of the main patrol camp.</span></p>
