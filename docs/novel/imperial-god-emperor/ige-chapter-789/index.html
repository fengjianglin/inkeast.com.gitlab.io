 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were the experts of the Black Demon Abyss martial hall, the representatives of the true top powers of the Black Demon Race. They rarely showed themselves in public and almost always stayed in the martial hall to train. They would not come out if it were not a major event. But this time the Little Princess of the Black Demon Race was involved so the three of them all rushed over here. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I'm all right.” The Little Princess shook her head.</span></p>

The most important thing had finally been completed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle Feng.” The Celestial Phoenix Maiden greeted the guardian Saint, her voice was not as cold as before and instead there was a hint of gratitude. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I'm glad you're out, I'm glad you're out, I thought you girl, you...” The guardian Saint Feng Silong was somewhat emotional that he even addressed her as ‘girl’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had watched the Celestial Phoenix Maiden grow up. Although they were not related by blood, their relationship was as close as father and daughter. Three days ago, when the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect splashed the dirty water onto Ye Qingyu and said that the Celestial Phoenix Maiden had died, Feng Silong really blamed himself so much that he hated the fact that he was unable to immediately massacre the entire Heaven Wasteland Domain. But then the more he thought about it the more that he felt it wasn't right. As he was on his way back, he heard the news that there were people that had come out of the 18th district of the Black Demon Abyss. Anxiously, he rushed back but he ran into an unknown guardian Saint who stopped him and the great battle had delayed him by one day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The heavens took pity on him. He finally saw the Celestial Phoenix Maiden alive and well in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What happened before?” The guardian Saint glanced around and sensed that something didn't feel right.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Celestial Phoenix Maiden had not answered, when Ye Qingyu came over with a smile on his face and gave a cupped fist salute, “Elder, we meet again, I ask elder to grant me Black Demon Herb, I have not disappointed and completed the mission of bringing the Celestial Phoenix Maiden back safely. We have completed our deal, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Silong was startled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only now that he realized that the white-robed handsome youngster before him was the beggar-like young man in rags from three days before. The changes in aura between the two were too great that if Ye Qingyu had not spoken he really would not have recognized him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed heroes come from among the youth.” Feng Silong nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the bald fatty Sheng Yan, he naturally recognized him; however Feng Silong could not recognize the jade-like young man in green standing next to him, who was strangely handsome and with a very strange aura. Just as he was about to ask, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden tugged at his sleeve and shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Silong was surprised for a moment, then looked deep in thought and did not say anything else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The great battle that happened on Fierce Beast Peak was from the beginning covered up by [Iron Heart Blood Saint] Yang Tianwu's silver formation, which later was completely destroyed by [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] using his supreme divine ability and did not leave behind the slightest trace or aura. As a result, even with his level of cultivation, Feng Silong could not tell what exactly had happened here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three experts of the Black Demon Abyss martial hall felt the same as Feng Silong. Although they were puzzled, they kept silent and didn't say anything else after receiving a signal from the Little Princess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a moment, there was a very bizarre silence on Fierce Beast Peak.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu felt very lucky. His greatest harvest from the 18th district was not obtaining countless divine treasures, medicine and opportunity, but to get to know these trustworthy friends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, it was time to part.&nbsp;</span></p>

More than one third of the one month of assessment period had passed and he also did not know how Xing'er and the others were now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the thought of this, Ye Qingyu felt an arrow was shot at his heart.</span></p>

The green mountain does not change and the blue water will flow forever, if you see me as a friend, then we will see each other again.” Ye Qingyu smiled and was ready to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Little Princess nodded slightly upon hearing this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked at the few people at the summit, her eyes were no longer cold and there was instead a gentle brilliance. Finally, she shifted her eyes back to Ye Qingyu. The corner of her eyes twitched, as if she wanted to make an expression, but she turned around the next moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Demonic clouds rose into the air, and the Black Demon qi around them was faintly dissipating.&nbsp;</span></p>

I know, you are a good person, more importantly... we're friends.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you.” Ye Qingyu nodded, the corners of his mouth curled in a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The present Black Demon Abyss was not peaceful at all. The people who had come out of the 18th district had all encountered interception, whether it was the Young Lord of the Sinful Pit or the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect. There were Saint level experts hiding in the dark in order to seize the treasures that they had gathered from the 18th district. The situation back then was very tragic, and the experts who had hidden themselves in the darkness were all old monsters and cunning demons with terrifying strength. If the Saintess of the Jade Pearl Sect and the others did not have some secret treasures and weapons on them, then perhaps these heaven’s pridelings really would have died here.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the Celestial Phoenix Maiden seemed to have not heard his voice at all, and was still standing there blankly with an absent look in her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cough... Your Highness...” The guardian Saint raised his voice and spoke again, “Let's go back, too.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Her Highness had always had this habit of being lost in thought, which did not seem to have improved as a result of her attaining nirvana.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That's right.” Feng Silong nodded. Ye Qingyu was also one of the people from the 18th district, which meant that he was also one of the targets of the people secretly hiding in the dark. This youngster was talented and was worth helping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who knew that Ye Qingyu gently shook his head, saying, “There is no need. I have other things to do. I understand your intention, thank you very much.” &nbsp;</span></p>

If it were not for Ye Qingyu, all of the people would have perished in the 18th district during this trip. He had too many cards on him that even she could not see through him, especially that giant cauldron... his safety should not be a problem.</span></p>

If Li Xiaofei had not helped out there was most likely nobody who could have suppressed that [Iron Heart Blood Saint] Yang Tianwu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] turned to look at the Celestial Phoenix Maiden, nodding slightly.&nbsp;</span></p>

What was most astonishing to him was the fact that he felt that this person's face was somewhat familiar, as though he had seen him before, but he did not think too much, and eventually also gave a cupped fist salute and was ready to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will see each other again, right?” As they were leaving, the Celestial Phoenix Maiden suddenly halted her footsteps and turned around to look at Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>

When he first met her, she was quiet, always in a daze, and cold. But later on when they were picking herbs she exuded a hint of innocence, as well as that drop of precious Phoenix blood, and the trials and tribulations that they shared as they were trying to escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
