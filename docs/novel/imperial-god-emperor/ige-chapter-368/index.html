 <p><span style>Chapter 368 - A Broken Sword </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The young men roared. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Accompanying the roar was an explosion of indescribable powerful force. The strength that the young experts have been suppressing was suddenly released like a fierce tiger or legendary dragon concealing their claws. The frightening imposing aura was like the roar of a mountain and the scream of the sea. It diffused towards the surroundings, causing a chaos in airflow and a distortion of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards of the Du household were immediately shrinking back in fear. It was only then that they found out what kind of people they had just besieged. This stupid behaviour was just as ridiculous as a group of dogs arrogantly trying to attack dozens of dragons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A mountain-like momentum shot skywards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the midst of the 18 youngsters, several streams of light shot forward. Dauntless like knives, they hurtled towards the [Ten Gods of Slaughter].</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once a decision was made, there was not the slightest of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngsters of a military background were decisive in killing and attacking. They had been on the battlefield thousands of times before, and knew the importance of decisiveness and courageousness at a critical moment, so they would not shrink back at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingyu was at the front all along. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The huge [Beheading Wind] sword flashed out like a silver lightning. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The formless sword intent of the [Human King Sword Mantra] was engulfing all over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the [Ten Gods of Slaughter] standing in the center was the first to sense the invincible killing intent coming. The battle instinct of a strong expert saved him. At that critical moment, he let out a loud howl, activating yuan energy to its peak and bringing the weapon in his hands up to his chest. The brilliance of formations shrouded his body, strongly blocking the force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The shield of yuan qi around his body was broken, the beams of formation light scattered and vanished like withered leaves. Blood splattered about in the chaos, and his weapon smashed into fragments and flew in all directions. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a killing strike had scared this person witless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without trying, he realized the formidableness of the dark-haired youngster straight away, which was absolutely far beyond the range that his strength could withstand. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Retreat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Retreat instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not have the courage to go up against Ye Qingyu and immediately turned to intercept the other young experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingyu repeatedly launched three sword attacks. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The power of the [Human King Sword Mantra] was activated to its peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The invisible sword intent broke the void. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Three swords. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Three gods of slaughter were wounded and retreated. </span></p>
 <p><span style>[Beheading Wind] sword was not inferior in any aspects. Like a tiger stamping on a flock of sheep, none of the [Ten Gods of Slaughter] could, in such a short time, block one of Ye Qingyu’s moves and remain undefeated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, once they saw Ye Qingyu charging over, the gods of slaughter of the patrol camp immediately stumbled back several steps, evading. They simply dared not to view him as the enemy, nor did they have the courage to fight back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the youngsters’ side, the morale was immediately like a hurricane.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, [War God] is invincible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, [Avalanche] was brandishing a pair of giant hammers. His strength was as strong as a wild tiger, and seeing Ye Qingyu’s invincible appearance, he was all fired up and began roaring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The morale of the young men was greatly boosted. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the blink of an eye, the strength of the 18 people completely suppressed the The [Ten Gods of Slaughter] of the city’s north district patrol camp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The [Ten Gods of Slaughter] were considered as combat experienced veterans, but in this battle, where the young experts have far more experienced in fighting, they were pressured to retreat little by little. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Swoosh! Swoosh! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Two beams of light shot out from the purple-red airship. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the entry of more experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two subordinates of the Du household that went into the cabin before also joined the battle. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The situation was saved a little for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the eighteen young experts were still as imposing, like a rainbow, constantly pressing forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within [Purple eye] Du Heng’s eyes, purple flames flashed. The biting coldness was more and more severe, and he suddenly made up his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s the [Divine Dragon Crossbow]?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He said faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before his voice fell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Four scarlet red fire snakes suddenly burst forth from the purple airship. Silent, like the evil touch of ghosts and spirits, they shot towards the four young experts that were busy fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The [Divine Dragon Crossbow]?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingyu was taken aback. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Among the information that the Two River Gang collected and submitted to him, it had mentioned the existence of such a killing weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The [Divine Dragon Crossbow] was a formation crossbow that was developed by the Empire for ordinary troops to defend against Bitter Sea experts. It is said that both the crossbow and the arrows are made of a special material, crafted by a formation smithing master and enhanced with formations. It was costly to produce, and only the empire’s royal family and imperial guards were provided with it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This kind of crossbow, if a real expert drew the bow, the force of the hit, if it was a frontal hit, was enough to cause the fatal death of a Bitter Sea expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The origin of the three words, [Divine Dragon Crossbow] referred to the fact that this kind of crossbow can threaten even a master-level expert on the [Divine Dragon List].</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a normal battle, if the experts were on the alert, they would obviously not fall into the trap. But if unguarded, or if there was a large area coverage attack launched from the [Divine Dragon Crossbow], the slightest of mistakes may cause them to die with a grievance in their heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The four young experts who were caught in a battle with the city patrol were not aware of the crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately there was Ye Qingyu. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Quicker than words could tell. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The four scarlet red fire snakes were travelling at extreme speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crush them!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingyu discovered them at the first instance. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the beginning of the battle, he was observing [Purple Eye] Du Heng, because Ye Qingyu knew very well that this talent was the real mastermind of this operation, and the most formidable enemy in this battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Du Heng uttered a word, Ye Qingyu was immediately on the defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His figure flashed, and he flung away one of the Gods of Slaughter that he was currently entangled with. The [Soul Stealing Heaven Strike] was used. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A vague figure flitted across the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly accelerating, flashing like a stream of light, and blocking the four fire snake-like divine dragon arrow’s trajectory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“[Storm of Swords]!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second move of the Unmatched Generalwas once again used.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The endless storm of sword qi, along with the sword intent of the [Human King Sword Mantra], caused the power to reach an unprecedented degree. The sword intent and biting coldness that was filling the air instantly crushed the air. The fabric of space was as though it was being broken up into rippling water. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The four [Divine Dragon Crossbow] bolts seemed endless, but as they were drawn into the [Storm of Swords], like a clay ox entering the sea, they silently vanished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? What kind of move is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Purple Eye] Du Heng was astounded</span></p>
 <p><span style>At lightning speed, the [Storm of Swords] had already swept away everything, like a hurricane of the heaven, and the sword intent had filled the air. As it approached the purple airship, thousands wisps of invisible sword intent were spinning and terrifying sword intent was slashing out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sharp and loud warning noise sounded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The formation energy protection barrier of the airship had only suffered less than one second of attack of sword intent, but immediately turned to a shocking red colour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shoot a man first before shooting a horse, capture the ringleader first in order to capture all the followers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tip of Ye Qingyu’s sword was precisely pointing in the direction of [Purple Eye] Du Heng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impudence!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Heng understood Ye Qingyu’s intention, his face immediately flickered with a hard to contain anger. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The matters today had developed to this degree, which was beyond his initial estimate, and he was already enraged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strength and unity of the young experts made the pretentious and arrogant Du Heng repeatedly miscalculate, and his anger became uncontrollable. The more self-confident and intelligent a person, the more easily they erupt in anger when a mistake in their judgement was made, and only an extremely rational person could control themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Du Heng obviously had not yet reached such a state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This little army barbarian has a death wish. He dared to point the sword at me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Heng gave an angry laugh. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In so many years, probably ever since he entered the boundary of the Bitter Sea stage, almost no one in the entire Snow Capital dared to point at him with a sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems that his younger brother is right, some pigs must be killed. He must chop off the heads of these pigs in order to let this group of stupid idiots know what kind of people they can not offend and which ones should be respected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pass it!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>[Purple Eye] Du Heng made a backhand grasp in the air, when a purple lightning shot out from a cabin of the airship, landing in his palm, and turning into a two-meter-long purple coiled dragon spear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Clasping the spear in one hand, Du Heng’s imposing manner soared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To stand in the imperial capital, which is similar to a dragon’s pool and a tiger’s den, perhaps ordinary aristocratic families would be able to. But to become the commander of the City Patrol Camp of the Snow Capital, this required true skill and talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Purple Eye] Du Heng naturally had true skill and genuine knowledge. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Six years ago, he had already entered the Bitter Sea stage; he was a true top level expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His wrist was vibrating slightly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hum Hum Hum!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strange light of the spear was hissing and the vibrations set the air quaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The purple gold coiled dragon spear turned to a purple light that filled the sky, like bizarre stars in the night sky, dense and numerous, attacking and shrouding Ye Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cluster of dazzling sparks exploded in the void.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It exploded out to an area of 50 meters. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The rumble of the sword and spear was like a contention between god and the devil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The void was trembling. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the twinkle of an eye, no one knew how many times the two sides struck each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Electric Poison Dragon Drill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Purple Eye] Du Heng bellowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was his yuan power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The purple brilliance in his eyes was like a liquid substance, when the yuan energy was activated to its peak, he really looked like the devil of legend. The purple flames of qi around him were frantically curling up, and the sharp point of his spear contained a strange and majestic magical power, as though it was about to pierce through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingyu waved his sword to fend off the attack. </span></p>
 <p><span style>[Beheading Wind] sword struck the sharp point of the spear, and a bizarre and imposing force came gushing towards him. Ye Qingyu could feel the palm of his hand shaking, and as he listened attentively to the sound, the thick blade part of [Beheading Wind] immediately emerged a soybean-sized gap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The opponent has a Treasure tool?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Qingyu was suddenly slightly apprehensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In terms of weapons, the power of a treasure weapon was far above spiritual weapons. Relying on weapons alone, this [Purple Eye] officer had suppressed him. It seems he must be careful. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Want to block me with a broken sword? See if you can catch my following attacks!” “</span></p>
 <p><span style> [Purple Eye] Du Heng’s voice was aggressive and cold, like the god of death was approaching, every thrust of his spear contained a kind of primitive mighty force that made the very sky tremble! </span></p>
