 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because at that moment, the physical body of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] had suddenly collapsed like a carved statue into fine powder, drifting away with the wind. In the blink of an eye it had disappeared from the top of Capital Sky Peak and no longer existed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How did that happen?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shocked, Ye Qingyu instantly flashed closer, but there was nothing he could do and it was difficult to reverse the situation. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fine powder dissipated, signifying... &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Impossible!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu forced that thought away from his mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was impossible for the peerless [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] to fall. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And since the [Cloud Top Cauldron] had returned safely, it proved that [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] had not been defeated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu convinced himself with tens of millions of reasons. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to find some clues from the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. He carefully sank into an observation state, but there was no special indication on the cauldron. The storage space in the cauldron, as before, was still stored with Ye Qingyu's collection. All precious treasures were present. [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei's] divine spirit was not preserved in the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. The only change was that drop of blood. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the blood of a Quasi-emperor. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And Ye Qingyu was certain that it must be the blood of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What had happened in that starry field, and what was the outcome of the battle? Ye Qingyu saw with his eyes that the grey-copper temple was smashed, and that a terrifying long-haired creature had rushed out to battle against [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]... What kind of creature was living in the grey-copper temple? It did not look like a creature of the present age, nor was it human form, more like a beast that had escaped from the ancient chaos world. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;“Brother Li... will not return.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man Quasi-emperor let out a sigh. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew how terrifying the grey-copper temple was, and that Li Xiaofei had been trapped in it for four thousand years. After he escaped from the temple, he had mentioned to him about some of its secrets. It had been a long period of time since a martial arts Emperor had been born, and generally speaking, it should not be the case. In the past, even in the Dharma Ending Age where the tide of the heavens and earth had subsided, there were still martial arts Emperors being born. Now, the spiritual qi in the world was abundant, though it did not quite reached the peak, but why wasn't there a martial arts Emperor existence? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only the Human Race, but there weren't any martial arts Emperors being born in other races.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Xiaofei had once said that, between the heavens and earth was a terrifying existence that did not allow a martial arts Emperor. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, there had been more than a few evildoers with the possibility of striking the Emperor path, and even a few peerless martial artists who were in no way inferior to the martial arts Emperors back then. They have already had one foot into that field, but all eventually fell in the end. There was an invisible hand controlling everything in the dark, preventing a martial arts Emperor from emerging into the world again. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only the old man Quasi-emperor knew that Li Xiaofei did not really have the absolute confidence to achieve the position of the martial arts Emperor, but wanted to test out something, to lure out some existence. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now it seemed that Li Xiaofei's guess was correct. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let's go, let's get out of here, the world is going to change.” The old man Quasi-emperor was ready to leave. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu subconsciously nodded. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, it was unknown whether [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was alive or dead, and the Human Race had lost a pillar. Perhaps ordinary people or forces had not perceived this change, but for those who were truly at the peak of the world, they would certainly sense this change. The situation will soon turn chaotic again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was even more convinced that [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was not dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not self-deception, but a strange intuition. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's intuition was accurate a lot of times. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let's go.” Ye Qingyu asked, “Where will elder be going?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man Quasi-emperor may perhaps be the last Quasi-emperor of the Human Race——Although the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect did not fall in the Quasi-emperor battle, but he evidently did not stand on the side of the Human Race. On the contrary, he had all along been on the opposite side of the Human Race. Ye Qingyu hoped that the old man Quasi-emperor could support the Human Race for a while. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I'm going to take a walk around this world.” The old man smiled, a very deep meaning in this smile. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu understood the old man's meaning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He planned to warn some forces, to let the world understand that, even if [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was not present, the Human Race still had another pillar. He was going to show his fangs and muscles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A respectable old man. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let Little Lu Wei follow you.” The old man smiled and patted his grandson on the shoulder. “I have nothing to teach him anymore, he must slowly walk the rest of the road himself, let him go as far as he can.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandpa?” Lu Wei looked at the old man in surprise. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu also vaguely sensed that something was wrong. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as though the old man Quasi-emperor was making future arrangements, and had even entrusted his beloved grandson to Ye Qingyu. Could it be that... something was going to happen to him? Impossible, how would there be danger for a Quasi-emperor. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The sword that had taken ten years to polish, its frosty edge has yet to be tested, today this sword will be shown, will a storm be created out of nowhere?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man patted his grandson gently, before his figure gradually faded away, leaving this place and dissipating from the heavens and earth. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Wei opened his mouth to speak, but in the end did not say anything. It was unknown what he was thinking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu stored away the [Cloud Top Cauldron], and carrying fatty, headed down the mountain road. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was not a single figure on the Capital Sky Peak. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two men had walked thousands of kilometers, but had not come across any experts. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The various seals and formations that existed on the outskirts of the Wei River Mountain Range had disappeared unknowingly. The mountain range was bleak and desolate, with traces of the great war left behind. The collapse of the large mountain peaks showed how terrifying the battle here was, and some of the remains of the battleship, which had lost its essence and core, were scattered across the valley, covered in dirt and moss, as though many years had past. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu specially made a trip to the God Emperor Peak. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately before he found Nan Tieyi, the God Emperor Peak had already been flattened, turned into pieces of gravel. It was evident that when the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor was destroyed, this supporting peak also collapsed. The last trace of the Immortal God Emperor Sect was also destroyed. The former mountain gate was covered in grass and plants. Only just over half a year had passed and it already looked like a wasteland.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a short stay, Ye Qingyu left. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An hour later.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not quite right, why aren’t there any creatures around, as if they’re all dead.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unlike the chaotic scenes of the outside world that he had imagined, Ye Qingyu found that everything and everyone was very calm in the towns he had passed by. Everyone was very indifferent, like nothing had happened. He specially went to the inn and other places, where he found that the focus of the discussion was not the Quasi-emperor battle or the Reincarnation hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor. What was even more bizarre was that, along the way, he had not seen a single disciple of the Greater One Sect... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By asking around, he came to learn that six months ago, the Greater One Sect had withdrawn from Clear River Domain, gave up the huge cities that they had formerly occupied, as well as the mountain gates and the blessed lands, without showing the slightest reluctance to leave. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard they were going to wage war on other domains...” someone told Ye Qingyu. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some people also said that the elite team of the Greater One Sect was being hunted by a mysterious expert, suffered heavy losses, and had to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But these were all six months ago, and had in effect, also was not hot news. At least the Human Race had no longer paid attention to this matter. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu also heard a shocking piece of news. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the past six months, no experts had come out of the Wei River Mountain Range. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, after the news of the coming of the Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor broke out, the experts of all major domains and races who were attracted to the Wei River Mountain Range still had not come out?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu found it hard to believe. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he had traveled past several Human Race cities as well as a number of foreign race cities, and the news he received were unexpectedly in agreement. In the past six months, only a few people had come out from the mountains, and according to speculation, many experts must have died in the Wei River Mountain Range.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The present Wei River Mountain Range was a place of death for Clear River Domain and for many other domains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Ye Qingyu did not see many corpses when he came out from the Wei River Mountain Range.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, there were at least hundreds of thousands of foreign races that rushed up Capital Sky Peak and were driven away by him. The Reincarnation Hall of the Chaos Demon Emperor had broken, and there was nothing to compete for. Logically speaking, the hundreds of thousands of experts should have come out of the Wei River Mountain Range alive but this turned out to not be the case. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Where did they go? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Across the Wei River Mountain Range, there were no signs of mass killings or traces of fighting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did those people disappear into thin air? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu found it a little bizarre, but did not put too much thought into it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before returning to Heaven Wasteland Domain, Ye Qingyu paid a visit to the Demon Spider Race.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to find the round-faced Prince Mo Jin to ask him about Wang Jianru and Song Xiaojun. Since the Demon Spider Race was one of the clans of darkness, they should be linked to the Unmoving City of Darkness in some ways. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We pay our respects to the Human Race deputy envoy.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The patriarch of the Demon Spider Race and his people greeted Ye Qingyu respectfully at the bottom of the Demon Spider Mountain Range. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then Ye Qingyu had been hunted by the Demon Spider Race, and even an elder of the Demon Spider Race could threaten Heaven Wasteland Domain. At that time, the Demon Spider Race, for Ye Qingyu, was a giant that mustn’t be provoked. But everything had been reversed. Ye Qingyu was now the third deputy envoy of the Human Race with illustrious achievements. Even if the Demon Spider Race did not know about the terrifying matter on Capital Sky Peak, his stories on the Road of Chaos was enough for the Demon Spider Race to bow to Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Throughout the Clear River Domain, there was no other force that could win against Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demon Spider Race was no exception.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was in a hurry, thus he did not climb the Demon Spider Mountain Range. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But after a few inquiries he was disappointed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“His Highness Mo Jin has not returned to the Demon Spider Mountain Range for three years?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The news revealed a lot of information, including the fact that the Demon Spider Race had lost control of the young prince. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover it was unknown what he was doing out there. The elder did not appear to be lying, because when it came to this matter, several of the Demon Spider Race elders were still very angry. Mo Jin's behaviour was equivalent to betrayal. It was a great crime to not listen to the orders of the elders, and in accordance with the rules of the Demon Spider Race, the clan had also sent masters to capture Mo Jin, but unfortunately failed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is a terrifying force behind him, and I, his father, can't do anything about him.” The Patriarch of the Demon Spider Race, an ancient spider of over five thousand years old, was only of the Saint realm and the strongest of the Demon Spider Race. He indeed was no match for Mo Jin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And about the Unmoving City of Darkness, the entire Demon Spider Race did not know anything. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have heard about the name of the Unmoving City of Darkness in the ancient texts of the clan, but unfortunately that traitor had already taken away all the ancient texts... I’m sorry to disappoint Lord deputy envoy.” The old Patriarch said to Ye Qingyu in an apologetic tone of voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had two sons. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One was Mo Jin’s older brother, who had excellent talent and showed strong capability, but had unfortunately died in the Heaven Pass training long ago, killed by a disciple of the Greater One Sect. Later, they provoked Ye Qingyu and other people. The remaining Mo Jin could be regarded as the heir, but he was rebellious and failed to live up to his expectations. As a father, he felt that he was a failure, and when he mentioned Mo Jin, he clenched his teeth in anger. It was evident that he had severed the father-son relationship. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu released his divine sense to confirm that the other side was not lying. Knowing that he would not find out much information from his trip to the Demon Spider Race, he looked slightly disappointed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is Lord deputy envoy going to return to Heaven Connect City for the funeral?” The Patriarch tried to ask, and then respectfully said, “The fall of Lord Ren is indeed a very shocking news. The heavens are jealous of the heroic genius. Even if we are from different races I extremely admire Lord Ren. However, we are not qualified to go to Heaven Connect City and can only hold a memorial service here. Hope Lord deputy envoy can understand... ”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Patriarch was speaking, he motioned some people to bring over a few trays. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was frozen where he was, “What did you say? Offer condolences? Offerings? What's going on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah? Does Deputy Envoy Ye Qingyu not know?” The old Patriarch was taken aback, “This...” His expression changed and immediately knew that he had said the wrong thing. The death of the main envoy of the Human Race of the Domain Alliance, Ren Puyang, had spread across the thousands of domains, and had brought about great changes. It was rumoured that the situation for the Human Race in Heaven Connect City had become very bad. He thought that Ye Qingyu already knew, and wanted to offer some offerings to improve the relationship, who would have known... his flattery brought nothing but annoyance. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened? Lord Ren? You... is it Lord Ren Puyang?” Ye Qingyu almost felt that everything in front of him had darkened. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This... there is news that the main envoy of the Human Race Ren Puyang had died. His body had been transported back to Heaven Connect City, and the funeral is being prepared... I heard that it had caused a storm in the Domain Alliance. All major forces have rushed there. The situation for the Human Race is very bad, especially for the former commander of the Divine white-robed guards. The former trusted aide of Lord Ren Puyang was said to be the murderer who killed Lord Ren Puyang and had been declared as a traitor, subjected to arrest. It is now all chaos!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How was that possible? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu almost passed into unconsciousness when he heard the bad news. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ren Puyang had died? &nbsp;</span></p>
