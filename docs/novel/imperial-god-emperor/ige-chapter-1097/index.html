 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This voice commanded everybody's attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were not many people in the world who were able to challenge the sect master of Four Stars Sect to a duel in front of everyone. Ye Qingyu was one of them, but experts who were comparable in strength to the four main leaders of the White-robed Divine Guards were not considered challengers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when they saw who had spoken, the crowd gasped and had to admit that this person indeed had the right to challenge the sect master of the Four Stars Sect on such an occasion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This man stood straight and tall in a stately manner. He was similarly dressed in white robes and an iron flute hung from the jade belt that was cinched at his waist. He was handsome and elegant, his beard was well-maintained and beautiful, his eyes were as bright as stars, and his features were well-defined and full of righteousness. He carried himself authoritatively, as if his imposing aura could be felt even when he was not angry. He even managed to hold his own even when he stood next to Ye Qingyu. And actually, his aura seemed to be intensifying with time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is that him?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes, I think it is. Now that the four main leaders of the White-robed Divine Guards have appeared, it would be weird if the spokesperson himself didn't make an appearance."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crowd discussed it animatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of the spectators in the void had already identified this man——</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He used to be the second deputy spokesperson of the Human Race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And now, he had been promoted to the position of the spokesperson of the Human Race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There had been two main deputies under Ren Puyang. The first was Ou Wuji, who was more well-known and had a greater presence in the Human Race headquarters at the Alliance of Domains, so he was a prominent figure. But during the battle of the mourning hall, Ou Wuji decided to seek redemption and ultimately died in battle. The second deputy had always been a mysterious figure who kept a low-profile. Only a few people had seen him and it was rumored that he was a hidden warrior who did not care for power or politics. He worked in the shadows just as Ou Wuji worked publicly to keep an eye on the headquarters of the Human Race. Only the elders of the past knew exactly how mighty and powerful this second deputy was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the battle at the mourning hall, Ye Qingyu refused to become the next spokesperson of the Human Race, so the second deputy had naturally stepped up to take on this mantle and take command of the Human Race headquarters at the Alliance of Domains. He had made use of the past year to establish his command and turned the once chaotic headquarters into an orderly operation. He made use of his authority and his power to gain the complete cooperation of everyone at the headquarters. It was also only during the same period that the foreign races and forces of the Vast Thousand Domains came to know of this warrior who used to operate from the shadows. However, up until this day, no one knew what his name was or which sect or force he belonged to. They only knew that his last name was Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Issuing a challenge to the sect master of the Four Sects Sect as the spokesperson of the Human Race could even be said to be beneath his status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the Four Stars Sect had publicly agreed to submit to the command of the Human Race headquarters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This also meant that the sect master could not make up excuses to try to evade this duel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, the reputation of the Four Stars Sect would truly be in tatters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As everyone's focus turned to him, the sect master of the Four Stars Sect stepped forward and said darkly, "Spokesperson Li, may I know what crimes have the Four Stars Sect committed for you to mobilize the entire strength of the Human Race headquarters to attack us? How could you lead the four main leaders of the White-robed Divine Guards into battle based on the words of Madman Ye who had killed so many? Are you merely just a puppet leader of the Human Race headquarters who acts on the orders of Madman Ye?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spokesperson Li smiled, "Every bite and sip has been preordained. Your gift of gab will be useless today."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took out the flute that hung from his waist and slowly stepped forward, his figure flickering with each step he took. Soon after, he was within a hundred meters from the sect master and he said, "Please make your move."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sect master clenched his jaw and said, "Are we battling to determine a winner, or are we battling to the death?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We shall battle to the death," Spokesperson Li replied calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sect master was reluctant to battle, not because he was afraid of dying, but because he could not figure out how things had turned out this way. Ye Qingyu alone could not possibly have the power to mobilize the entire strength of the Human Race headquarters. His reputation had risen rapidly, but he could not possibly command such power and authority, so had they miscalculated or overlooked some detail?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I want an explanation," the sect master said through gritted teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spokesperson Li shook his head slightly and sighed. Then, he said, "I'm sure you are well aware of what the Four Stars Sect has done. Your sect's actions have brought shame to the Human Race and have to be condemned by the Human Race and the entire Alliance of Domains… This plan to launch a punitive expedition on the Four Stars Sect was not my decision but had been planned while Mister Ren Puyang was still alive. Now that you know this, this should quell whatever resentment you may have."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What?" The sect master's expression immediately changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This plan had been in place while Ren Puyang was still alive?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He immediately realized that the Human Race headquarters was clearly well-aware of what was happening internally within the Four Stars Sect, so there was no point in trying to deceive them any longer, nor was there any way of avoiding this battle today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright then." The sect master smirked coldly after his doubts were cleared up. "Since this is the case, there is no point wasting any more time on small talk. This plan might have worked if Ren Puyang was still alive, but today, haha, even if you use all your resources within the Human Race headquarters, you will no longer be able to defeat us."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spokesperson Li said with a small sigh, "You still refuse to admit your wrongdoings… I guess Deputy Ye Qingyu has made the correct decision."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as he spoke—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He brought the iron flute to his lips, and as his breath circulated, a melodious tune could be heard from his flute. Then, this tune transformed into a visible formation in the void that looked like chains as it swept toward the sect master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Human Race spokesperson who had always kept a low-profile was a master at using music as his weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Get lost!" the sect master shouted. Then black and white flames flickered in his palms to transform into two swords that were black and white respectively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He slashed out with his swords and destroyed the musical formations. His sword will spread across the skies like heavenly starlight and hurtled toward Spokesperson Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the saying goes, once an expert attacks, everyone can tell exactly how strong they are.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two prominent figures immediately displayed their incredible strength the moment they made their moves. Although both sides had only launched initial probing attacks, the aura they unleashed was as abundant as roaring waves and immediately surpassed the battle of the Seven Sons against the leaders of the White-robed Divine Guards and Lu Wei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu stood on the stone steps of the divine temple and watched the battle unfold quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not time for him to make his move yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soldiers were battling soldiers while the masters were also battling against each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sect master of the Four Stars Sect was definitely not the strongest person within their camp. If the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect was not present, then these battles would merely be an appetizer and this would be reduced to the Human Race headquarters pitting their resources against the Four Stars Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon after, someone else emerged from the divine temple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Four Stars Holy Girl, I challenge you to a battle." The chubby Li Shengyan glared angrily through bloodshot eyes at the Four Stars Holy Girl, who stood across from him. It had been more than six months since he had been badly injured by her and her accomplices, and after this near-death experience, he had emerged to become even stronger and his strength had skyrocketed. He wanted to challenge the Four Stars Holy Girl to avenge the death of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] because the Four Stars Sect had plotted against his ancestor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The descendant of the Li clan? Very well," the Four Stars Holy Girl said as she stepped forward. "You are no match for me anyway. Killing you will be as easy as slaughtering chickens. Now that Li Xiaofei is dead, as the descendant of the Li clan, shouldn't you also join him in his grave? If I were to destroy the Li clan's bloodline of the Ming Domain, then I would truly be destroying Li Xiaofei's legacy. Today is the day I will kill you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Shengyan remained silent and inhaled a huge mouthful of air. His entire body expanded like a balloon, as though he had absorbed all the spiritual qi within the universe, then he reached into the void and pulled out a pair of heavy golden hammers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was his first time summoning a weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clink!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He smashed the hammers against each other and the sky was filled with golden bolts of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle began instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Different kinds of energy forces circulated and clashed within a ten thousand-kilometer radius of this void, and each battle was a fierce battle to the death that was fought with astonishing and intense ferocity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time ticked by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect did not make an appearance. But despite his absence, his presence was like a huge rock that pressed on the back of Ye Qingyu's mind along with all those from his camp, while the elderly Quasi-emperor had the same effect on the Four Stars Sect's camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu continued to wait quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One hour later, there was a change on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Aah…" Meng Wuyou screamed as his arm was hacked off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This expert, who was part of the Seven Sons, was ultimately not Lin Yutang's match after a prolonged battle. When they faced each other head-on, he quickly had been unable to hold his own against Lin Yutang and was seriously injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Kill!" Lin Yutang shouted and attacked ruthlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Poof!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A head rose into the sky as Meng Wuyou was beheaded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He reconstructed his physical body in the next instant but his face was pale and it was clear that this had taken a huge toll on him. When these Four Stars Sect's experts saw how ferocious Lin Yutang was as the battle dragged on, they felt afraid and quickly retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Yutang followed closely in hot pursuit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meng Wuyou had sustained a series of serious injuries and was almost as good as dead. He could no longer continue battling and he frantically tried to flee and retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu frowned slightly when he noticed this scene but he did not break his silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a flash of green thunder and lightning appeared from the void and charged as quick as lightning toward Lin Yutang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What?" Lin Yutang was shocked and hastily tried to retreat, but it was too late. This green lightning was extremely peculiar and had honed in on him the moment it appeared. The force and laws it contained were so powerful that chills ran down his spine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is the end!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ln Yutang immediately shut his eyes and readied himself to face death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, a wisp of faint white light suddenly appeared and shrouded his figure. Miraculously, this white light managed to tug him away from the green lightning attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huh?" a clear feminine voice exclaimed in surprise. Then, a beautiful woman who wore a long blood-red dress emerged from the void with surprise clearly written on her exquisitely beautiful face. "Has the successor of White Jade Capital also joined forces with the Human Race headquarters?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This gorgeous woman in a red dress was none other than the [Fatally Beautiful Fairy], Jiang Xiaohan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was the one who had attempted to kill Lin Yutang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another equally beautiful woman emerged from the void across from her. This woman was dressed in a white dress and looked like a fairy from the Moon Palace. Aloof and cold, she looked completely detached from worldly affairs. She was the extremely mysterious successor of White Jade Capital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was the one who had rescued Lin Yutang by a hair's breadth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One woman had attacked, while the other had saved—they were as powerful as fire and water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We are destined to battle each other." The successor of White Jade Capital made one of her rare statements. Her voice was clear and melodious and sounded like the tinkling of cold jade pearls against each other. It was extremely pleasing to the ear and it was also so cold that one could get chills listening to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Xiaohan laughed loudly and her aura blazed around her like a scorching fire as she said, "Very well. We're destined to battle not only because of the ancient grudge between our masters, but also because… I know who you are."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two women, who were widely regarded to be the most mysterious beauties of their time, faced each other in the void and attacked in unison as their duel began.</span></p>
