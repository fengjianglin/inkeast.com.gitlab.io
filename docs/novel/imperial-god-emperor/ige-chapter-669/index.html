 <p>Chapter 669, Burning Snow perish</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The [Snow Ground Pig Bats], [Black Crows of Misfortune], and other Demon Race military divisions also began to retreat uncontrollably.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>These two demon battle divisions originally belonged to a comparatively lowly and unintelligent tribe of the Snow Ground Demon Race, and considered to play a cannon fodder role in the Southern Incline army, relying on endless numbers to gain dominance. In the face of an expert that surpassed beyond their understanding, and under such divine pressure, they were finally awakened, suddenly restoring their rationality. The demonic beasts that had ended their frenzy, looked at the figure of Ye Qingyu, trembling, and had lost their previous fearlessness and fierceness.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The battle finally stopped for a while.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The entire battlefield all of a sudden became incredibly quiet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But the tense and suffocating atmosphere did not subside in the slightest.</p>
 <p>Several seconds felt as long as dozens of centuries.</p>
 <p>The demons in the depths were also silent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu asked again, “Do you still think you’re lucky? You should understand that in the face of absolute power, the battle technique of throwing a sea of demons is ineffective to me. Even if the entire Southern Incline army were to attack at the same, there would be no effect. The heaven cares for all beings, I do not want to solve this problem just by simply killing. You had best tread carefully; otherwise the next moment, the side whose blood will flow across thousands of miles and bones pile like mountains will definitely not be my Human Race army’s.”</p>
 <p>His words, like the decree read by a deity, echoed in the air.</p>
 <p>The imposing manner of the Demon Race's battle divisions frantically dropped again.</p>
 <p>And in the Youyan army, every soldier was fired up in this moment.</p>
 <p>The fact that Ye Qingyu emerged in Youyan Pass was a well-known matter in Heaven Wasteland Domain. The scene of the strong and intimidating Demon Race being deterred made every single warrior of the Youyan army feel an indescribable sense of pride.</p>
 <p>Finally——&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chu!Chu!Chu！</p>
 <p>A prolonged bugle noise of the demon clan sounded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Demon Race camp was suddenly separated by a crack down the middle.</p>
 <p>A huge snow dragon battleship swam from amidst the bodies.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The thousands of meters long battleship was like a living Snow Dragon, flickering with a silver glow under the sun, and filled with a power unique to the Dragon Race. All sorts of demonic light cannon, like arrowheads, were densely distributed everywhere. The battle ships of the Demon Race had always been only interested in combat power and killing performance, so in terms of aesthetics, it obviously was not in line with the vision of the Human Race.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The battleship was clearly transformed from the corpse of a Snow Dragon.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Generally speaking, the family of Snow Dragon had a relatively special status in the Snow Ground Demon Court. After death, a Snow Dragon would be buried in the Snow Dragon’s family cemetery, and rarely made into a battleship. Those allowed to ride such a battleship must be the higher levels of the Demon clan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the Snow Dragon Battleship neared, all the people of Youyan Pass saw the dozens of figures at the bow of the ship.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The most striking of course was the figure closest to the middle and front. A full five- or six-meter-tall figure who, even among the demons, was incredibly tall, had thick, white hair all around his body like silver needles. There was not the slightest human feature on his body, he was completely a huge white bear. As he stood up, there was the strong aura of a demon at the upper echelon being exuded.</p>
 <p>Under the watchful gaze of the soldiers of both sides, the Snow Dragon Battleship slowly stopped in the void thousand of meters from Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>“Human!” the huge white bear spoke, his voice like the roar of thunder reverberated across the void, “What are you going to say?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu knitted his brows in a slight frown and said, “So it’s the Deputy General of the Southern Incline army General Snow Bear Demon? What? Where's commander Burning Snow Demon? Why isn’t he coming out and seeing me?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was from Youyan Pass, and had a very systematic understanding of the military of the Snow Ground Demon Race, especially the important figures of the Southern Incline army, which he was able to recognize at a glance. The huge white bear was the deputy general of the Southern Incline army. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Don't ask a question that you already know the answer to, you sent an assassin and assassinated our respected commander Burning Snow, why do you ask?” Snow Bear Demon roared, “Human, you are humiliating us, even if you are stronger, my Southern Incline army is not afraid, even if we die today, this matter will not be left just like that.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What? &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was just as surprised when he heard this, “Commander Burning Snow Demon... has fallen?”</p>
 <p>Snow Bear Demon roared, “Don't ask a question you already know the answer to, you despicable humans. You dare to do it, but are afraid to admit it?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu looked at the face of the Deputy General of the Southern Incline army, thinking about the frantic behaviour of the Southern Incline army before. He already knew that the huge bear was speaking the truth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just that the news of Commander Burning Snow Demon being assassinated was too shocking.</p>
 <p>It should be said that, in the previous clashed between the Human Race and the Snow Ground Demon Court, the Youyan army had also thought of countless methods to kill Commander Burning Snow Demon, the number one enemy. Unfortunately, they had not been successful, but now that the Snow Empire was no longer in war with the Snow Ground Demon Court, the strongest expert of the Southern Incline army and even ranked in the top ten demon experts of the entire Snow Ground Demon Court, was unexpectedly assassinated?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Who could do that?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It seemed that in recent times, the imperial military had stopped all the dark operations against the foreign races at the borders, right?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu turned his head around to look at Lu Zhaoge and the other people beneath the city wall.</p>
 <p>Lu Zhaoge's face was similarly twisted with a look of great shock, gently shaking his head.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was not done by the Youyan army.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Given my current status and identity, there is no need for me to deceive you,” Ye Qingyu stated again, looking at the human bear demon, with a calm and indifferent face, “And I can assure you that the Snow Empire has not planned such an assassination, which means that it should not have been done by the people of the Snow Empire.”</p>
 <p>“Hmph. Human Race experts assassinated our Commander Burning Snow, I saw it with my own eyes, the tens of thousands of soldiers of the Southern Incline army also witnessed it.” White bear demon grunted, “That human expert, claimed to be under the order of the Snow Empire's Crown Prince to kill our commander.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s expression remained unchanged, “Sometimes, what you see with the eyes may not necessarily be the truth, this, as the Deputy General of the Southern Incline army, you should understand.”</p>
 <p>The White Bear Demon looked taken aback for a moment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the Deputy General of the army, he naturally was not really a fool.</p>
 <p>“More importantly, I think you are not aware that, just this morning, a wave of Snow Ground Ancient Demons attempted to assassinate the military God of Youyan army Lord Lu. My Youyan army suffered a heavy loss,” Ye Qingyu looked at the White Bear Demon. “Your Snow Ground Demon Race also need to give an explanation to my Youyan army.”</p>
 <p>“What?” White Bear Demon exclaimed, shaking his head, “That is impossible, the King City’s Demon God Snow Mountain has issued the order, to not cause trouble at the border again. My Southern Incline army has stopped all plans of attack, this... it can't be our doing.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His voice faded, and after a brief pause, White Bear Demon’s scarlet, pool-like eyes flashed, realizing something all of a sudden.</p>
 <p>“Human, you mean...” White Bear Demon stared at Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded his head, “If I am not mistaken, there should be some power that isdeliberately stirring up the dispute between the Human Race and the Snow Ground Demon Race.”</p>
 <p>White Bear Demon fell silent, deep in thought.</p>
 <p>The major military corps of the Demon God Snow Mountain had already heard of the news that the Snow Ground Ancient Demons had awakened. Previously, the Snow Ground Demon Court also had gotten into some dispute with these Ancient Demons. These days, the actions of the Ancient Demons were a lot more restrained, but unexpectedly they had gone to attack Youyan Pass instead.</p>
 <p>After several moments.</p>
 <p>White Bear Demon raised his head, casting a glance at Lu Zhaoge at the North city gate of Youyan Pass and then opened his mouth again, and said in a firm tone of voice, “No matter what, Lu Zhaoge of the Youyan Army is still alive, and the Commander of the Southern Incline army Burning Snow has been killed. The people that killed him, is no doubt your Human Race, this is the unshakeable truth. Commander is a deity-like existence in the heart of every warrior in my Southern Incline army. The Human Race killed him, the Southern Incline army will certainly avenge him, even at the risk of our lives, unless you humans can give us an explanation.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded, “Fine, what explanation do you want?”</p>
 <p>White Bear Big Demon firmly stated, “Surrender the murderer to the Southern Incline army.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded, “Okay, I can do that.”</p>
 <p>White Bear Demon inwardly breathed a sigh of relief when he heard these words.</p>
 <p>To tell the truth, although he appeared to be aggressive outwardly, in fact, he was only forcing himself to hang in there. The Human Race youngster opposite him really was too powerful. White Bear Demon was known as a fierce warrior in the Snow Ground Demon Race, an elite military expert who had fought hundreds of battles, but in the face of this young man, deep down he still could not help but quiver in fear. Fortunately the other side was very restrained, and did not fly into a rage, otherwise, it would not be long when the Southern Incline army was removed from this world.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And at this time, White Bear Demon also vaguely guessed the true identity of this human youngster.</p>
 <p>With regards to the news in Heaven Wasteland Domain, the Snow Ground Demon Court had also been closely following any updates. They had already received the news that the Lord of the Light Palace of the Snow Empire had emerged in the world. The information and news of Palace Lord Ye Qingyu, including his strength, judgments, portraits, and even his hobbies were paid close attention to.</p>
 <p>“Within 10 days, I will give an explanation to the Southern Incline army,” Ye Qingyu stated, “But you must withdraw your troops. If you use this as an excuse to disturb the Youyan Pass, then don't blame me for being ruthless.”</p>
 <p>White Bear Demon agreed to the request.</p>
 <p>The bugle of the demon clan sounded, and the dark tide-like army of demons in the sky began to retreat, like the receding tide, fading into the direction of the snow mountain in the distance.</p>
 <p>The Snow Dragon Battleship also slowly started turning around to leave. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just then, Ye Qingyu suddenly spoke again, “Wait a minute.”</p>
 <p>White Bear Demon shuddered inwardly, thinking that Ye Qingyu had changed his mind, and turned around to say, “What? Do you want to take back your words, Lord of the Light Palace?</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu smiled, “No, I want to go with Deputy General White Bear, to pay a visit to the Snow Ground Demon King. Would that be fine?”</p>
 <p>White Bear Demon took on a ghastly expression when he heard this, looking at Ye Qingyu with incredibly astonished eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The Crown Prince of the Snow Empire has already notified Snow Ground Demon King, I think Deputy General White Bear already knows. Don’t worry, I will go alone.” Ye Qingyu smiled. “The Snow Ground Demon King does not dare to see me?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, Deputy General White Bear could hear the prodding tone in his voice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But he still very respectfully replied, “This matter, I need to ask my King. Human Race Palace Lord, you need to wait.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu nodded, “Okay.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Snow Dragon Battleship drifted away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The battle that arrived suddenly came to a temporary end.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But in Youyan Pass, everyone were still feeling uneasy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The news that commander Burning Snow was assassinated had shaken everyone. Adding to this, the Ancient Demons had attempted to assassinate Lu Zhaoge. The situation was becoming slightly clearer, the secret great wave was not only set off by the Human Race, but most likely a combination of multiple forces. It was definitely not as simple as it seemed on the surface. From the fact that even Burning Snow had been killed it was clear how terrifying the other side's power was.</p>
 <p>After a day.</p>
 <p>The information from the Southern Incline army was that they had agreed to Ye Qingyu's request——&nbsp;</p>
