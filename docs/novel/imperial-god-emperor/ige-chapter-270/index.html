 <p>270 - Two matters</p>
 <p>The voice was not loud or too quiet, but it sounded out throughout the entire Proud sky centre. It was as if the person speaking was right beside them.</p>
 <p>Ding Li frowned.</p>
 <p>As the person who was to uphold affairs, to be interrupted. This was a matter that was particularly enraging.</p>
 <p>But the voice sounded out from the number one Xian Pavilion, he could not become angry. Instead he smiled towards the number one Xian Pavilion: "Do you have anything you want to say Zhaoge?"</p>
 <p>By referring to him as Zhaoge, and not War God Lu, Ding Li wanted to demonstrate that his status was perhaps even higher than Lu Zhaoge.</p>
 <p>Within the number one Xian Pavilion.</p>
 <p>The person shrouded by a silver mist so that his identity could not be discerned, was namely the War God of Youyan Pass, Lu Zhaoge.</p>
 <p>Without paying the slightest of attention to Ding Li's provocation, Lu Zhaoge sat in the main seating area. His voice was like a bronze bell that sounded out: "There are outstanding heroes everywhere today, the meeting can be counted as a great event in Snow Empire. Before the martial meeting truly begins, I have two matters that I want to announce to all my martial friends.....”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, Lu Zhaoge lifted his hand, his finger piercing through the air.</p>
 <p>A silver light that was like a sharp sword, pierced out from his finger.</p>
 <p>This light shot hundreds of metre high up into the air. The air began to ripple, like waves that undulated. A dimly lit gate, began to appear in front of everyone, slowly opening.</p>
 <p>"Last evening, someone dared to ambush a military officer of the Empire, destroying White Horse tower. The Empire is enraged and the army sent out experts to investigate. We've finally found the location of that scum. It was the remants of the Battling Soul Sect, that dared to cause trouble. Hmph, this person planned for a long time, and had the aid of interspatial formations to help him escape. But just how could he escape from the chase of the Empire?"</p>
 <p>Lu Zhaoge's voice constantly sounded out from the number one Xian Pavilion.</p>
 <p>They could see the dimly lit gate opening, with a figure inside.</p>
 <p>There was a middle aged man who was as thin as bamboo, that was pushed out from the dimly lit gate. There were golden coloured formation shackles binding him. Messy ash gray hair was being blown everywhere by the wind. At once glance, he seemed like a withered scarecrow, but there was faint black mist encircling him. It was exactly the same as the aura emitting from the giant foot descending from the heavens.</p>
 <p>Behind him,there were two golden armoured guards to both sides, holding him firmly in place.</p>
 <p>The sinister middle aged man madly struggled. Constantly, there was a surging power like an ocean vibrating within his body, wanting to break free. But the golden coloured formation shackles forced him firmly in place. These strange formations transformed into an invisible energy, that restricted all of his abilities.狰</p>
 <p>But even if so, everyone in the Proud sky centre, was able to clearly feel the power of that sinister, grey haired middle aged man.</p>
 <p>This was a true top level expert.</p>
 <p>Many people's hearts began madly beating.</p>
 <p>There were varying expressions on the faces of the other people in the other Xian Pavilions.</p>
 <p>The Ding Li who had a expression of mockery, had a different expression entirely. The instant he saw the middle aged man, there was an extreme shock that flickered through his pupils that disappeared in an instant. He turned to look at the Li Qiushui next to him. Li Qiushui's gaze did not turn away, his expression calm.</p>
 <p>"Black Wind Old Eagle!"</p>
 <p>There were people letting out gasps of shock next to the Bright Moon Lake.</p>
 <p>[Black Wind Old Eagle] was a Bitter Sea stage existence that was always mysterious within the world of sects. He did not belong to any sect, and appeared very rarely. Without any family or friends, he always acted alone. They were very little people that knew just where did he originate from. But the way he did things were cruel and sinister. He liked to exterminate organisations and families completely, having done every evil deed under the sun. In these tens of years, there were several shocking tragic cases that had traces of this monster behind it.</p>
 <p>There were several times that the sects banded together to hunt this monster down, but in the end he was able to escape.</p>
 <p>Who would have thought the mysterious expert that had destroyed White Horse tower, was this monster.</p>
 <p>They had never heard that this old monster had any conflicts with the Empire, but he was a remnant from the Battling Soul Sect.</p>
 <p>Hundreds of years ago, the Battling Soul Sect was a famous and powerful sect within Heaven Wasteland domain. It's achivements were significant, there were very few people that dared provoke it. Later, it was completely crushed by the army of the Snow empire. Nearly everyone of that sect died in battle, and their sect's buildings were completely destroyed. So the [Black Wind Old Eagle] was one of the remnants of the Battling Soul Sect....</p>
 <p>The people became even more stunned after hearing of the background of this middle aged man.</p>
 <p>[Black Wind Old Eagle] was famous for his cruelty, but he was also famed for his cautiousness. He was able to escape from the sects that banded together time after time again inexplicably. From this one could tell just how strong and intelligent he was. This time he had planned carefully to act against the Youyan army, and suddenly struck to destroy the White Horse tower. As soon as he had succeeded, he had fled far away. But in less than fourteen hours of time, to be captured by the Youyan army...</p>
 <p>This....</p>
 <p>Thinking of the power of the Imperial family of Snow Empire and the Youyan army, was enough to make one shiver.</p>
 <p>"To dare provoke the Empire, kill!"</p>
 <p>Lu Zhaoge's voice, was always calm without the slightest sign of emotional fluctuation.</p>
 <p>But everyone, could hear an attitude that made them shiver in such a voice.</p>
 <p>The word kill was uttered.</p>
 <p>There were the tragic howls that seemed like the cries of ghosts echoing throughout the air.</p>
 <p>The golden coloured formation shackles let of a brilliant golden light, like it was a yellow coloured flame. It lit the body of the [Black Wind Old Eagle] alight. This old Bitter Sea stage expert, seeemd to be covered by flame, like he was burning everywhere. His skin, his flesh, his organs, his muscles, were slowly being devoured and ultimately, even his eyes began to burn with this golden flame.</p>
 <p>"Ahhhhhhhhhhh…..."</p>
 <p>A tragic howl broke through the air.</p>
 <p>A true top class expert could have a lifespan of a thousand years. He was a powerful and invincible figure in the eyes of many people. But in the blink of an eye, he had transformed into a pile of ashes.</p>
 <p>Under the stare of countless dumbfounded glances, the golden armoured guards retreated, disappearing in the dimly lit gate.</p>
 <p>The dimly lit gate also gradually disappeared following this.</p>
 <p>Everything in the air reverted to normal.</p>
 <p>As if nothing had happened whatsoever.</p>
 <p>A clump of ashes descended from the skies. It was blown apart by the wind, scattering and becoming so small one could not see it with the naked eye.</p>
 <p>The people of the Jianghu who could not help but cheer when the martial meeting had just begun, their heart was currently as cold as an explosive snow storm. Even an idiot would understand, that the arrangements to hunt and kill the [Black Wind Old Eagle] was namely the Empire demonstrating its muscles to all the experts here.</p>
 <p>In just one night of time, to capture and kill a famous Bitter Sea stage expert. This kind of power was definitely something the sects did not possess.</p>
 <p>Even the inheritors and elders sitting at the Xian Pavilion from the large sects, had a face of seriousness.</p>
 <p>For the Empire to act as such a fast speed, this was too far out of the norm.</p>
 <p>There had been many like incidents happening in the past, but none provoked such a reaction.They did not imagine that the Empire would be like a enraged fierce tiger, with such an intense reaction.</p>
 <p>Could it be, the reason why they acted so fiercely, was because this matter concerned Ye Qingyu?</p>
 <p>There was a great deal of information you could draw from that.</p>
 <p>"The second matter is that I want to announce to the Empire using such an event, is that I have accepted Ye Congyun of the Vanguard in the Youyan army as my disciple." Lu Zhaoge was still enshrouded by the silver mist, so no one could see his true appearance.</p>
 <p>This was also an extremely shocking incident.</p>
 <p>Although the matter of Lu Zhaoge accepting a disciple had already began to spread out slowly, but this news was still largely unknown the the majority of the population.</p>
 <p>The status of the Youyan War God was high.</p>
 <p>Even in the sects, he would be regarded as a famed and powerful expert. In these years, he had always remained discipleless, but to think that he would accept a disciple today. This Ye Congyun, just what kind of person was he, that he could gain the War God of Youyan's appreciation.</p>
 <p>They could see a young military officer that clasped his hands and bowed in front of Lu Zhaoge. He bowed sincerely and honestly, thanking his master for his kindness.</p>
 <p>Everyone suddenly understood.</p>
 <p>So it was that person.</p>
 <p>In that instant, countless gazes focused their attention on Ye Congyun.</p>
 <p>The minor officer seemed as if he did not notice such glances. After performing the disciple master ceremony, he still stood with his hands by his side, standing behind Lu Zhaoge.</p>
 <p>"Fine, elder Ding, you can continue."</p>
 <p>As Lu Zhaoge finished talking about these two matters, he transformed into a ray of light, disappearing from the number one Xian Pavilion.</p>
 <p>He evidently did not have too great an interest in the martial alliance meeting after.</p>
 <p>The Ye Congyun who had become the inheritor of the War God, stood at the side of the pavilion. He did not avert his gaze, his back as straight as a spear. There was a specialness about him. Many people guessed, where he was from, who he was, just what his talent was. To think that he would receive an opportunity that countless people dreamed about.</p>
 <p>Ding Li stared at the empty number one Xian Pavilion. His heart could not help but grow angry.</p>
 <p>Lu Zhaoge's attitude and actions, made everyone in the Jianghu and sects feel that he had slapped them across the face.</p>
 <p>Following this, he had originally prepared a speech to raise the morale of the Jianghu people. The crowd below still had not recovered from the two news that he had anounced, not paying attention to his words at all. The fiery and passionate scene that he had imagined in his head did not appear. Under the clear fresh air, and sunlight, everything seemed somewhat stilted next to the Bright Moon Lake.</p>
 <p>The number ten Xian Pavilion, was still empty.</p>
 <p>"The matters of the Jianghu, will be settled in Jiangu. In these days, there were several big incidents happening in and outside of Youyan Pass. There were frictions between sects, there are people of the Jianghu who have created eminites between one another. Previously, to prevent Youyan pass from becoming chaotic, everyone have repressed themselves. Today, you can settle all your grievances in the Water Ray arena on Bright Moon Lake. To the death, if you so please."</p>
 <p>Ding Li's voice, with the aid of yuan qi, resounded throughout the entire Proud sky centre.</p>
 <p>This was one of the most important keynotes of the martial alliance meeting.</p>
 <p>Competing in martial arts, no matter when, would be an event that made the blood of martial experts boil.</p>
 <p>Before he had even finished.</p>
 <p>Xiu.</p>
 <p>A figure landed on the Water Ray arena at the centre of the Bright Moon Lake.</p>
 <p>She was a woman wearing mourning clothes. She seemed to be extremely young, wearing coarse clothing as she was in mourning. She held a mourning staff draped in white, with a haggard face. Her expression was furious as she said: "I am the widow of the Xuan sect, Liu Ying. I ask for [The Leaf of Youyan] to appear, so we can settle our grievances."</p>
 <p>Her voice was not loud.</p>
 <p>But it was loud enough so that everyone around the lake could hear it clearly.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s heart trembled.</p>
 <p>It had began.</p>
 <p>So it was like this.</p>
 <p>The first person this woman challenged, was naturally the Ye Qingyu whose hands were filled with the blood of Jianghu people recently.</p>
 <p>But there was still no one at the number ten Xian Pavilion.</p>
