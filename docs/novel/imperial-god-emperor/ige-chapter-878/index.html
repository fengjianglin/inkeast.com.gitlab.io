Their plan was an escape, but they could also be said to be running away like stray dogs. If Ye Qingyu had not come today, they would have turned into corpses. Now that senior brother Jin Yu had died, what other plans would they have. Although she was a woman, she was incredibly attentive. She turned to Qin Hui and said, “Young Madam, since you have returned to Ancient Sky Dragon Sect, you must already have a complete plan in mind. We are willing to listen to your orders.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have no plans, this time Lord Ye Qingyu is the leader of all operations in Ancient Sky Dragon Domain,” Qin Hui answered frankly and without any hesitation.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she didn’t know what Ye Qingyu would do next, but from what she had seen and felt along the way, it had given her complete trust in the young man from Heaven Wasteland Domain. It could even be said to be reverence towards a very strong expert in the world of martial arts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All eyes were then gathered on Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Qingyu smiled, “I also don’t have any plan yet, let's go to Yu Leaf City first. I heard that Zhang Ye and Qiao Qu have a deep understanding of the present Ancient Sky Dragon Domain. Why don't you come with me to Yu Leaf City, and the rest of the people will stay here until the matters in Yu Leaf City are resolved, then we will return.”&nbsp;</span></p>

The other brothers can hold on for some time, but, Madam Luo and the ordinary people, they...” &nbsp;</span></p>

However, he was a simple and honest person, and really could not stand to see the ordinary people starve to death here. Thus, he shamelessly spoke out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Cheng Kui and the other disciples could rely on yuan qi to withstand for a few more days, but the ordinary people could not hold on any longer. Moreover, this place was far from Yu Leaf City, and if the other traitors came when they left, then the hundreds of people would be slaughtered like lambs. &nbsp;</span></p>

The snowy, silver light flowed like water ripples, like the first glimmer of dawn, and directly formed into a silver light barrier. In the blink of an eye it had already expanded to a radius of thousands of meters, and with a loud rumble, protected everybody within it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light barrier screen was faintly discernible, and the dense formation markings on it were like spirit fishes swimming around, emitting an extremely pure spiritual aura.</span></p>

With Ye Qingyu current understanding of the laws of Heaven and earth, let alone creating xuan ice in this dried up world, it was also possible for him to do so in a fire domain.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even the former Patriarch may not be able to do this. The power of Lord Ye Qingyu really is terrifying. He is so young, how could he be so strong. Could it be that he looks young on the surface but is in fact already thousands of years old?”&nbsp;</span></p>

However, the inside situation of Yu Leaf City was a little disappointing to Ye Qingyu.</span></p>

In many streets and alleys there were corpses piled up, and the main street was as desolate as an abandoned city. There were very few people around and occasionally a few shops that were open. It was a completely deserted city. &nbsp;</span></p>

There were less than one million people living in this city, and if this continued, Ye Qingyu was certain that in less than ten years, the giant city will fall into the same fate as the other ruined cities.&nbsp;</span></p>

Upon a careful look he found that he was situated on a straight and neat street that was at least twenty meters wide. On both sides of the street were numerous magnificent buildings, pavilions, and in front of them stood a huge mansion, majestic and cold. At each side of the door there were ten Ancient Sky Dragon Sect disciples, and behind them were two giant sky dragon statues that were as high as ten meters. It was as if they were real, emitting a glorious aura.</span></p>

Although shocked by the fact that it was snowing in Yu Leaf City, many people could not care too much and only thought to snatch as much snow as possible. A patch of snow was a drop of water, which was as precious as gold in Yu Leaf City.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was obvious that they were going to break into the residence.&nbsp;</span></p>

Along the way, as soon as there were traitor disciples of the Ancient Sky Dragon Sect that appeared, they were turned into ice sculptures with different but distinctive expressions before they could utter a single word.&nbsp;</span></p>

They seemed to be in a meeting, rushing out into the main hall one after another to see Ye Qingyu and the others walking in in the midst of snow and wind. They were headed by a fifty-year-old imposing-looking expert who was around the pinnacle of the Immortal Step realm. His face changed as he lifted his hand to point at Ye Qingyu, and was about to ask...&nbsp;</span></p>
