He silently sat on a stool, his dark brown eyes sunken in his eye sockets. An empty trouser leg was tied into a knot, emptily dropping down to the ground. The most eye catching thing was his fingers, which was extremely long and slender, his nails like white jade. It did not seem like the withered and yellow fingers of a common old man. There was a glossy mahogany chinese fiddle in his hand that was emitting light, the skin of the fiddle also had a clear colour and luster. The skin of it was made from a python, the spine of the fiddle smooth and glossy. It was evidently made from high class mahogany. &nbsp;</span></p>

Her slightly dry long hair that was to her waist was bound behind her back, several strands of hair landing on her shoulder. Her linen coloured cloth dress had already been contaminated with mud. In her embrace, there was a square spice bag the size of a palm, covered with the pattern of almond blossoms. This pouch was something she adored extremely. No matter how dirty her hands, her face, her clothes got, the spice bag was still as clean as if it was new.</span></p>

She was thin and tired, her clothes torn, her large eyes dark and without expression. It was as if she was staring into the unknown space. There was a gentle and charming unknown little tune that was as loud as a fly constantly being hummed by her.</span></p>

His face had a thin layer of black fur around it, his eyes sparkling with red light. The blade scar down the side of his cheek was like a dense forest being divided in half. His strength was around the Heaven Ascension stage, and there were two large red patterned spiders on his shoulders .Evidently it should be something like his battle pets.</span></p>

All you lowly slaves must come to the the ruins of the City Lord's residence to witness this execution. Those who dare resist this order will absolutely be killed without exception." The human warrior said, his tone high and loud, "Do you understand?"&nbsp;</span></p>

As if he needed to count carefully just how many people were present in the inn. Using a voice that was like the creepy sound of rusty metal rubbing against each other, he said one by word, "You lowly slaves, if someone dares not to go, then this is equal to betraying the army. You will be treated similarly! At that, the divine Demon Spider warrior standing guard at Flowing Light City, the heroic and might Lord Devouring Heaven will personally conduct this execution. You will have the chance to experience the mightiness of Lord Devouring Heaven!"</span></p>

Those human warriors that were captured on that day, as long as they had the slightest shred of yuan qi cultivation, were roasted alive, or steamed. They were slaughtered like killing beasts. &nbsp;After entering the bedroom of the City Lord's residence, he did not like the fact that the bed was too hard.
