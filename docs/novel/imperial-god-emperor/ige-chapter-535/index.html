A winding river was flowing around the pavilions and rock gardens, spiritual fish wandering in the clear spring water, and cranes were gently crying on the divine trees. In the distance, 500 meters away from the ground, there were several formations flickering in the void, forming into one gigantic formation, which fully enveloped the about fifty or sixty mu (a unit of area that equals to one fifteenth of a hectare) of Enlightened Tea Garden. Not only had this altered the energy of this place,and locked in the yuan essence of the air, but it also sealed off the essential qi of the Divine tree’s [Great Dao Sentient Flowers] to prevent it from escaping. More importantly, it provided a strong defence to stop people from sneaking into the tea garden and causing damage.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were not only humans, but also other young experts of the major races.</span></p>

Once their strength reached a certain degree, it was possible for them to completely transform into human form. There were many demon clan experts that had chosen to take the form of humans. After all, in the Ancient Age, the most powerful two races - Gods and demons, were human form. So throughout the long history, human form was regarded as a kind of noble and perfect form, and many demons’ goal in life was to turn to human form.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was growing in the center of a crystal clear pond, and in the deep water of the pond were bright and fat spiritual fishes swimming about. The old branches were also intertwined, and on them were spiritual monkeys leaping from one branch to another. The leaves were not lush or flourishing, but each leaf was like a liquid, glistening under the sunlight. The dozens of branches at the treetop was covered with sparkling and translucent barks, but also on such branches were hundreds of fist-sized pale green flower buds that seemed like they would bloom at any second.&nbsp;</span></p>

Yes, this is our Greater One Sect’s [Great Dao Sentient Flower] tree, which only flowers once every fifty years. Today is precisely the day of flowering. In an hour, flowers will bloom and its aroma will fill the whole tea garden, like a fairyland.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the female disciples of Hundred Spirits Sect, she was the oldest, around 25 years old and radiated a very graceful aura. Her skin was fair and she had a very friendly appearance. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the other four were obviously younger junior sisters who had the same youthful and beautiful face. But one looked only 15 or 16 years old, dressed in a lavender long dress and had a beautiful sword hanging at her waist. Her body proportion was perfect, her facial features were delicate, and her skin was like white jade and seemed like it may break easily. She was exceptionally beautiful and tender even though she had not matured fully. Between her every frown and smile, there was a kind of captivating charm. She was a rare beauty, and the most eye-catching among them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Xiao Yunlong was speaking, his gaze was already sweeping up and down this female disciple’s body several times, unable to conceal his amazement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This little junior sister is...” he asked directly. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

Xiao Yunlong’s actions were very impolite and his interest was obviously lustful, but because she was afraid of his status, she politely introduced the girl. “She is a direct lineage disciple that just joined. Junior sister Liu, come over to greet senior brother Xiao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hundred Spirits Sect’s Liu Ruxin pays respects to senior brother Xiao.” The beautiful female disciple was a bit shy, like a startled skylark, hiding slightly behind the eldest senior sister as she was bowing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Xiao Yunlong heard this voice that resembled the sounds of nature, he suddenly felt all his bones going soft, his heart fluttering, as he was stepping forward, saying, “junior sister Liu really is remarkably stunning. It’s our first meeting, I have nothing with me to give to you, this jade pendant is something that I wear all the time. Please take this as a gift, junior sister Liu must accept it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, allowing no refusal, he directly handed over a jade pendant of a pair of mandarin ducks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This...” Liu Ruxin, not expecting to have such a thing happening, hesitated for a moment then quickly drew back.</span></p>

Once Liu Ruxin accepted this piece of jade, the whole situation will change, all kinds of rumours would certainly spread out everywhere and someone would say that they have secretly gotten engaged.</span></p>

How could we dare accept senior brother Xiao’s valuable gift, please take it back quickly.”</span></p>

Many female disciples have gone missing, your visit to Greater One Sect this time is to seek help. Haha, since it is to seek help, then we should be more closer, learn more about each other. This would help Greater One Sect to understand the situation and consider whether to send out battle reinforcements.”&nbsp;</span></p>

But because the sect disciples possessed extremely good medical skills and medical expertise, this was the main skill that was passed down to disciples. Many divine doctors had emerged in these thousands of years, who had treated several important figures of the major sects. So Hundred Spirits Sect was not only protected by many important sects of Clear River Domain, but also had the respect of many martial artists. Therefore the status of Hundred Spirits Sect was a little special.&nbsp;</span></p>

Only a few had lent a hand, but it was not enough to change the situation. &nbsp;</span></p>

But later they used a Greater One divine plate to exchange for a place, and were reluctantly allowed onto Greater One Peak. And that Greater One divine plate was given to the Hundred Spirits Sect 600 years ago when a divine doctor of Hundred Spirits Sect saved a supreme elder of Greater One Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>

Hearing that all the young elites of major sects would attend the Enlightenment Tea Party, Liu Yexing hoped that her disciples could get to know some successors of the influential sects, which would perhaps be of a little help in solving the crisis of Hundred Spirits Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
