Disciples and Patriarch of major sects and forces of various domains of the great world were found here. As the nominal center of power and main city of the entire world, the huge city could be said to be a collection of the characteristics and specialties of all domains, and a place of integration of domains and races.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So the beings that were found in this city, in addition to the experts of the major forces, there were many merchants, traders and adventure teams who had come to the city of integration. Compared to the other eighteen cities before, Heaven Connect City accepted all creatures and races, the laws were strict, and the defensive force could be said to be the greatest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some people said that in Heaven Connect City, as long as one had enough wealth, one can have everything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Others said that in Heaven Connect City, as long as one has enough talent, one can have everything.&nbsp;</span></p>

While the other two were most likely to be the head of a clan or a leader.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the name was changed, Heaven Connect City could even be called the Imperial city of the world.&nbsp;</span></p>

If they could become a registered citizen of Heaven Connect City, then they could basically do what they want across the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Evidently, the majority of the people on Welcome Square were not particularly powerful and with relatively ordinary status. They were curious about the various rumours and news of Ye Qingyu that they had heard these days on the Road of Chaos and had come to take a look at what kind of person Ye Qingyu was, who single-handedly defeated the legendary Black Moon Immortal Palace? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And it was clear that after laying eyes on Ye Qingyu, many people were slightly surprised to see that the legendary madman, the god of death, was so gentle and refined, just like an elegant Immortal, untainted by a speck of dust.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a moment, spirited discussion filled the air.&nbsp;</span></p>

All of the people of the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps wore a curious look on their faces. Some of whom were a little nervous, but immediately straightened up upon hearing the voices around them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because they knew that the War God of Heaven Wasteland Domain, Ye Qingyu, now had an enormous weight on the Road of Chaos. They also knew how famous the Young Lord was in Heaven Connect City.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an airship built based on the mythological beast Qui Nui, several hundreds of meters long. The shape was strangely beautiful, and there was a magnificent and ancient aura of the mythological beast slowly being emitted. A pressure instantly permeated the entire square, and filled everyone with a sense of awe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A slender and straight figure appeared on the front deck of the airship.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha... Mister Ren, you personally came... Haha, have you been well... I did not expect you to be sent here to receive the Heaven Wasteland diplomatic corps. It really is unexpected!” The fat Elder Yan Wushuang was taken aback for a moment. He obviously recognized the voice of the owner, wiped away the beads of sweat across his face and walked towards the airship with a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xiaoxing and Ye Qingyu exchanged a glance, and at the same time also moved toward the airship.</span></p>

His strength was of unfathomable depths, and he had supreme prestige among the Human Race and many other races. He was also one of the influential people that held the right to speak in Heaven Connect City. He was an honourable and righteous person, that even the enemy had to admit that he was a true humble gentleman. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the exclamations around, Ye Qingyu was secretly apprehensive.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Human Race senior only looked around thirty or forty years old, and had a gentle and warm face, beautiful brows, a tall nose and bright eyes. His long blue hair was secured back with a sword-shaped white jade hairpin, and his ocean blue robe was flickering with a ripple-like luster. He was both handsome and elegant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Ye Qingyu couldn't see through his strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Ye Qingyu's perception, Ren Puyang was deep and unfathomable, and he simply could not detect how powerful he was. There was not the slightest trace of yuan qi or aura emitting from his body yet he still gave the feeling that he was too strong, and that Ye Qingyu was no match for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a little while.&nbsp;</span></p>

Haha, young and promising, not bad. Also has an extraordinary presence... To know a man by repute is not as good as meeting him face to face.” After Ren Puyang exchanged greetings with the two elders, his gaze fell on Ye Qingyu, carefully examining him. His eyes grew brighter and in the end were overflowing with admiration. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Mister Ren... you know me?” Ye Qingyu asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before that, he was sure that he had never met this envoy. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ren Puyang gave a smile, shook his head, and answered, “Of course I do. Haha, although I have never seen you before, but during this one month you have caused quite a stir on the Road of Chaos. Not only had you utterly defeated the Black Moon Immortal Palace alone, you have also received the protection of a Quasi-emperor. This matter had shocked many sects and forces and has become the most popular topic in the great city. We are both part of the Human Race, I naturally have to pay more attention to you.”&nbsp;</span></p>

He has a much higher status in the Domain Alliance than my brother and I,” Yan Wushuang suddenly remembered, rubbed his belly and beamed as always.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was as though there were strands of silk-like rays of light circulating around the city wall like a colourful dragon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The roads that opened up in all directions were directly connected with the ground, or rather suspended in mid-air like an illusion, winding and crisscrossing. Similar to a spider web, a number of thousand-meter-high formation viaducts led to different parts of the city. There were formation airships and huge airships shuttling back and forth, as well as imposing knights and sect disciples clad in various uniforms, but all were beautifully dressed. They were riding different spiritual beasts and birds, traveling across the sky and along the roads at a rapid speed. &nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Old Fish, holding the silly dog, his eyes darted left and right with curiosity.</span></p>

It could be said that ever since formally stepping into the Heaven Connect City, their mouths had never closed once.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gathering all living beings of Heaven and earth was probably the definition of this giant city.</span></p>

It was simply unheard of and unseen before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the material used for these colossal buildings, they were even more colourful and varied, making one unable to take their eyes off of them.&nbsp;</span></p>

While some used dark green stones that overlapped each other, simple and ancient, but filled with spiritual energy. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, every building was richly ornamented in thousands of different styles- vermillion lacquer, gold-plated, as well as red pillars carved with dragons. It was dazzling without losing the solemnity.</span></p>

The temple was simply too tall, too majestic, almost to the point of being unbelievable. If Ye Qingyu had not seen it with his own eyes, he would not believe that there was such an incredible building on this world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone on the airship needed to look up before they could appreciate the temple. &nbsp;</span></p>

Looking up at the sky, the overall appearance of the temple was attributed mainly to the heavy eaves and halls. The walls were embedded with jade and gold. It was a unique and magnificent structure, which gave off a sense of majesty.</span></p>

This is real, not an illusion. This is the Parliamentary Temple of the Domain Alliance,” the fat Elder Yan Wushuang introduced with a beaming smile. &nbsp;</span></p>
