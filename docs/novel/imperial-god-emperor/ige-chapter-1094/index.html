 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1094, Subjugate the Four Stars Sect</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The alliance between the Dragon Human Race and the Heaven Wasteland Empire had been made clear to the world. The two domains, one new and one old, had a great relationship with the Human Race. It was only now that the forces of other domains understood that the so-called invasion of the Dragon Tooth Army into Heaven Wasteland Domain was just a disguise for the Heaven Wasteland Empire to eradicate the rebellions. It was rumoured that Ye Qingyu had once helped the Dragonblood imperial court to root out the loose alliance... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And the strategy between the Dragon Human Race’s War God, Xu Wuya, and the Dragon Human Emperor was finally revealed to the world. The so-called betrayal of the Dragon Tooth Army was simply false and was made to deceive other people. The loose alliance could be said to have suffered a heavy loss. The vassals had been completely eradicated by the Dragon Human Emperor through ruthless methods. Now the Dragon Human Domain had established itself, and the status of the Human Race had greatly increased and began to quickly restore its strength and power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the Little Dragon Girl Zhou Yuexin and her beloved had successfully married. She had sent an invitation to Ye Qingyu, but unfortunately he had disappeared already and did not receive the invitation. It was said that the wedding was personally arranged by the Dragon Human Emperor, and the Dragon Human Race’s War God Xu Wuya was the wedding witness. The marriage had caused a sensation in the Dragon Human Domain, and also opened up intermarriage between the Dragon Human Race and the Human Race. It had a positive effect in the advancement of the Human Race’s status in the Dragon Human Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Wasteland Empire also got great profits as a result.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having established friendly relations with the Dragonblood imperial court, the Heaven Wasteland Empire had a sudden rise in status and image in the entire Vast Thousand Domains. This rise was different from before when they all relied on the [Ice Sword Killing God], Demon King Ye. This was a kind of power ascension, indicating that the foundation of the Heaven Wasteland Empire had been strengthened. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, the merchants, domains and forces that had made things difficult for the Heaven Wasteland Empire before finally regretted their action. Not only were they shut out by the Heaven Wasteland Domain in trades and benefits, suffering a financial loss, but they had also offended many financial groups closely linked to Heaven Wasteland Domain. Thus they were jointly targeted and ended tragically. They could only do everything possible to beg Heaven Wasteland Domain for their forgiveness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a thing had happened several times before, and after this series of events, even the largest merchants and financial groups of the world were afraid to underestimate the foundation of the Heaven Wasteland Empire. Even if there were changes in the future, these groups were most likely not going to turn their backs on the Heaven Wasteland Empire. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu felt a lot more at ease when he learned this information.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, the Heaven Wasteland Empire had finally slowly begun to grow, its wings gradually plumping up, and even if he was gone, they also had a certain ability to protect themselves. This was considered as expanding the connections and relationships that belonged to the Empire. This was the most perfect sign of the rise of a great empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not stay too long in Heaven Wasteland Domain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the third day of Ye Qingyu’s return to Snow capital, he made a public appearance, then went to pay respect to the ancestors of the imperial family of the Snow Empire, met up and chatted with the former Emperor of the Snow Empire, and saw the First Princess. After the catch-up, he returned to Light City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then a day later, the Pill God of the Empire, the Medicine God and other older figures gathered in the Light Palace to formulate a plan with Ye Qingyu to enhance the defense formations of the empire. It took a full three months, before they finally drew up the plan, and then Ye Qingyu personally adjusted the changes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, Ye Qingyu took action again. With the formation masters of the empire, he strengthened the defensive formations of Snow capital and Light City, and used a large amount of financial resources to trigger the underground spiritual veins to gather under the Snow capital. Almost the entire capital was turned into an impregnable Immortal city. The control method and key to the formations were left to the Empress.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all this, Ye Qingyu left the Snow capital, and returned to the Heaven Connect City of the Road of Chaos.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Road of Chaos, Heaven Connect City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Connect City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? The Lord wants to subjugate the Four Stars Sect?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the main hall, the Great Dragon Turtle Demon was very surprised to hear this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Sect was a great sect of the world, with a deep background and foundation, and was where Quasi-emperors had emerged from before. Some time ago, the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect made an appearance, and how terrifying was his strength? Ye Qingyu had now said that he was going to subjugate the Four Stars Sect, how could they not be shocked?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If these words were uttered from someone else's mouth, the Great Dragon Turtle Demon would surely have thought it was a joke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when it came from Ye Qingyu's mouth it meant that something really was going to happen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu nodded, “I may leave for a long time, but before leaving I need to sever the possible threat, not to mention that the Black Moon Immortal Palace and the Four Stars Sect have deep hatred against my Heaven Wasteland Domain. It is time to settle this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the result of Ye Qingyu's careful deliberations. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This... Lord's idea, of course, is good, but the Four Stars Sect is a deep rooted force and not an ordinary force, it is best to be cautious.” The Great Dragon Turtle Demon was afraid to refute Ye Qingyu's decision, but still kindly reminded him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu smiled, “When have I ever done something that I'm not sure about. Don’t worry you just have to let the news out.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Dragon Turtle Demon received the order and turned away to take care of things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his heart, there was still a great shock. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu wore an indifferent expression. The Great Dragon Turtle Demon's reaction was within his expectations. After all, all the beings of Heaven Wasteland Domain had not really adapted to the reality that their domain had become a great force. Not to mention other things, but just the tens of thousands of elite soldiers, the countless experts of Heaven Wasteland Empire, as well as the advantage in resources and commerce, and the alliance with the Dragon Human Domain, were enough for them to compete with the Four Stars Sect. Moreover, this time it was not just him who would take action against the Four Stars Sect. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The headstrong youngster Lu Wei appeared, saying, “Grandpa has arranged everything, he is ready to go into the final battle.” On the youngster's face, there was pride, but also tears. He seemed to have learned some news from the old man Quasi-emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu gave a long heavy-hearted sigh when he heard this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the past year or so, the old man Quasi-emperor had continuously taken action. First it was in the battle of the mourning hall, where he blocked the Quasi-emperor behind Ye Chongsheng, then repressed and broke through the several domains and forces that had made things difficult for the Human Race, and had also personally erased a few of the great evil forces among the Human Race. His methods of doing things were incredibly powerful and had set off a huge wave in the Vast Thousand Domains. The fame and reputation of the Human Race Quasi-emperor, who had lived a secluded life in the past, had already surpassed [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]. He had become another pillar of the Human Race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Others criticized the old man Quasi-emperor for being too tyrannical, and that he would instead create enemies for the Human Race.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Ye Qingyu knew that the old man Quasi-emperor wanted to use the last bit of time of his life to show the world the power and muscles of the Human Race. He wanted to shock the stupid ambitious people and to bring peace to the Human Race with his last bit of strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because his life yuan finally after a long period of time was about to come to an end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then when the old man Quasi-emperor assisted [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] in that battle, he had already exhausted his life. At the end of that battle, the elder’s life yuan was already less than three years. This was the reason why he did all this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This matter, Ye Qingyu also only learned about a year ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Lu Wei evidently only just knew about it, which was why he was seen furtively wiping his tears. He could not accept the fact that his high and mighty grandfather, who was like a God Emperor of the Ninth Heaven, would die one day. He was filled with deep sorrow but there was nothing he could do to change this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu patted the youngster on the shoulder and didn't say anything more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, the proposal of subjugation of the Four Stars Sect was first suggested by the old man Quasi-emperor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had sensed the changes within the Four Stars Sect, and was aware of the seriousness of the matter. He knew that this former great sect, a top pillar-like sect of the Human Race, had been completely corrupted. Therefore he wanted to personally eliminate it at the last stop of his life, and gouge out the cancer growing within the Human Race.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was of course in agreement with such a proposal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the Great Dragon Turtle Demon was right, this matter naturally must not be treated recklessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the moonlight, Ye Qingyu was standing in front of the window on the second floor of the Heaven Wasteland Building, overlooking the whole Heaven Connect City, and began to ponder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An explosive message spread throughout Heaven Connect City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [Ice Sword Killing God] was going to subjugate the Four Stars Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The news broke out, shaking the entire Heaven Connect City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some of the higher-ups of the Domain Alliance were also shocked, and thought that it was a joke when they heard this. After all, the Four Stars Sect was a great sect that had been standing for countless years, and in recent years become very strong. They belonged to one of the top forces in the whole Vast Thousand Domains. Even if [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was alive he also would have to think twice about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But soon, the news was confirmed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because it came from the Great Dragon Turtle Demon, the owner of the Heaven Wasteland Building, who represents the Heaven Wasteland Empire and the [Ice Sword Killing God].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ye Qingyu had gone crazy?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This... something big is going to happen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the past, Ye Qingyu feuded with the Four Stars holy girl, could this be the cause of the war?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It won’t be so simple. I have heard that the fall of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] is connected to the Four Stars Sect. It was a trap set by the new Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect... If it’s because of this, it is understandable that Demon King Ye wants to retaliate against the Four Stars Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He should still think it over carefully first, after all it is a sect that a martial arts Emperor had emerged from before.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, back then, Li Xiaofei had once broke through the mountain gate of the Four Stars Sect, and now Demon King Ye also want to emulate him? However, he is not yet a Quasi-emperor. He most likely does not have enough weight to do so!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, in these years the Four Stars Sect had been in the limelight too much, and had started conflicts with many other forces and sects of the Human Race. It also did not get along with the former chief envoy of the Human Race Ren Puyang. Many conflicts had broken out between them. Vaguely they had already placed themselves above the Human Race, and the way they act is domineering and savage. Demon King Ye must not be able to stand them any longer. It's just an excuse to conquest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There's going to be a good show.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a moment, there were debates everywhere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless forces and sects were speculating and calculating the odds of Ye Qingyu's victory, but were not too optimistic. After all, to win against an ancient sect that a martial arts Emperor had emerged from was something that only a martial arts Emperor existence could achieve. The [Ice Sword Killing God] was very strong, very powerful, but he had yet to become an Emperor, and was not even considered a Quasi-emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the Four Stars Sect also responded. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just the barking of a jumping clown, Demon King Ye is looking for death. Bring it on! He will die at the foot of the Four Stars mountain with one slash.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars holy girl also responded——&nbsp;</span></p>
