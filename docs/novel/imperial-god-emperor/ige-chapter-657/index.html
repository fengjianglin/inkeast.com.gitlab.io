The fog in her eyes intensified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yangdao, on the other hand, looked stone-faced, not saying anything and just focused on playing with the sandalwood beads in his hands, as though he had heard nothing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Father Luo let out a soft sigh, his forbearance under all this really was too great.</span></p>

Perhaps it's just rumours, let's wait for Yi’er to come back and ask him.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Yi felt his heart aching when he saw his elderly parents' pleading expression. He made a coughing sound as he took a huge stride over, suddenly attracting the attention of the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only at this time that the people realized that the main party involved had finally come back.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The line of sight of the five people in the hall was instantly concentrated onto Luo Yi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mother Luo was after all a woman, and also relatively weak. She cast a concerned look at Luo Yi, her lips moved but she did not say a word. The dense fog in her eyes turned to tears, wetting the corner of her eyes. She then hurriedly pulled out a silk handkerchief to dab at the corner of her eyes and forced a smiling expression at Luo Yi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yangdao slightly looked up at Luo Yi and then dropped his eyes without saying a word, as though he did not see Luo Yi at all, and continued to play with the sandalwood beads.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elegant Madam Gu coldly raised her brows when she saw Luo Yi, lightly grunted, and did not say anything more.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yi'er, are you all right?” Luo Tiezheng asked softly. He originally wanted to immediately ask whether him being removed from [Blazing Flame Battalion] was true, but he swallowed back these words when it got to his mouth, for fear that he might say the wrong words and upset his son. He glanced at Luo Yi, his eyes tight and worried.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to the matter of the Gu family withdrawing from the marriage arrangement, he was more concerned about Luo Yi not being able to withstand the blow of being struck off from the [Blazing Flame Battalion]. He knew that Luo Yi, in order to perform well in the [Blazing Flame Battalion], had been training everyday and had invested a great amount of effort. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Luo Yi heard his father's voice, he faintly smiled and nodded to his father, “Father, I am fine, don't worry.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Father Luo saw that Luo Yi was calm and that there was no fluctuation of emotions, he then carefully asked, “Yi'er, you really left the [Blazing Flame Battalion]?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before his voice faded away, the atmosphere in the hall had suddenly stiffened. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Yi swept a glance around and nodded, “Yes, the order I received this morning...” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Yangdao and Gu Zhenzhen showed little reaction to his words, while Madam Gu calmly stared at Luo Yi, narrowing her eyes and a ridiculing smile made its way across her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Yi's mother's eyes were red again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked at her son with indescribable grievance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Tiezheng quivered a little upon hearing his son's answer, his face growing pale and his brows tightly knitted together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although already psychologically prepared, but when he heard Luo Yi directly confirmed the news, it was still difficult for him to accept it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since he transferred back to the Snow capital, the Luo family had been trying hard to survive in this difficult place. His official ranking was neither high nor low. At the border he may have a certain authority, but in the Snow capital, where nobles were everywhere, he was almost not worth mentioning. The Luo family's circumstances were very bad, and the opportunity to improve their situation was Luo Yi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since Luo Yi was selected into the [Blazing Flame Battalion], and came under the personal command of the Crown Prince, although his ranking was not high, his potential was very great. There were many forces of the Snow capital that had held out an olive branch to the Luo family, and the Luo clan finally gradually established themselves in the Snow capital.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Half a month ago, the news of Luo Yi's promotion came. The forces that were secretly watching finally could not hold back, swallowed their pride, and tried to express goodwill to the Luo family through various means. In a short moment, the Luo family's status in the Snow capital had rapidly risen, which made everyone in the Luo family unceasingly excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, now that Luo Yi had been removed from the [Blazing Flame Battalion], those olive branches were most likely going to become a charm of doom. It would be greatly difficult for the Luo family to make any further progress in Snow capital.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Tiezheng pondered for a long while, before he deeply took a breath, walked up to Luo Yi, gently patting his son on the shoulder, and reassured him, “Alright, It's alright, you're still young.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All right?” the harsh voice sounded again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Father Luo had not finished when Madam Gu began sneering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ridiculing expression twisted her pretty face, as she threw a sidelong glance at Luo Tiezheng and mocked, “Hah, how could you say it's alright, Lord Luo, your heart is so big. Luo Yi is removed from the [Blazing Flame Battalion], what sort of place is the [Blazing Flame Battalion]? It is the forbidden army of the Crown Prince Her Highness, and everything is in the hands of Her Highness. He was removed from the [Blazing Flame Battalion], and that is the order of Her Highness. His life is finished. Young? What's the use of being young? One word from the Crown Prince and he can't turn his life over!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Yi's face darkened. He opened his mouth and was about to say something, but was interrupted by his father.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Tiezheng patted his son on the shoulder, squeezing out a smile, and then turned in the direction of the Gu family to explain, “Lord Gu, Yi'er is still young, there is still hope for promotion in the future. Even if he's not in the [Blazing Flame Battalion], he can transfer to other places and serve there. It is too early to say that he has no hope. As for the marriage, how can it be decided and casually cancelled like that, it is not good for Zhenzhen's reputation. Lord Gu, let's discuss this matter again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not that he did not see the Gu family's condescending faces, but he did not want his son to suffer another blow from the marriage arrangement being cancelled after being removed from the [Blazing Flame Battalion].</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If there was a chance to redeem the situation, he certainly would do his best. After all, Gu Zhenzhen really was very outstanding, and his son was also very satisfied with her. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From a beneficial point of view, Gu Yangdao was the deputy minister of the Imperial Security Department. If the marriage went ahead, he may also be able to give his son a hand. As long as it was beneficial to his son, even if he had to let go of his old face, it was nothing to him. Luo Yi was in the prime of his youth, if he were to suffer the embarrassment of the marriage arrangement being cancelled, then he may be unable to recover and his life would be ruined.</span></p>

Even if you used to be a military official, you should also understand the officialdom. If you must pretend to be confused, then I have to be honest. As my wife had said, Luo Yi was removed from the [Blazing Flame Battalion] and removed by the Crown Prince Her Highness. You think it is so simple to leave the [Blazing Flame Battalion]? Her Highness is the one who will be ascended to the throne in the future, and those who are expelled by Her Highness, do you think there are any other places in the empire that dare to accept him? Although I appreciate Luo Yi's talent and also sympathize with him about what had happened, but I cannot take my daughter's life's happiness as bargaining chips to pacify him. Even if the withdrawal from the marriage arrangement today would have some negative impact on Zhenzhen's reputation, but that is just temporary. Zhenzhen after all is well known to be outstanding. As soon as this storm passes, I will naturally find her a good husband that matches up to her. As for Luo Yi, forgive me for being blunt, but he is now ruined. He is no different from a useless person and does not deserve my daughter at all. I am also a father, I can understand your effort, but I cannot throw away my daughter's life of happiness just because I sympathize with you.”</span></p>

It's your fault for offending Her Highness. In the Snow Empire no one would dare to use you in the future. Sign here on these two documents, and from then on, you have nothing to do with my daughter,” Gu Yangdao said, placing the silk papers on the table.&nbsp;</span></p>

The content was nothing else but the voluntary cancellation of the marriage arrangement and the two sides no longer having anything to do with each other.&nbsp;</span></p>

Then he slightly streaked his index finger across his thumb. A bead of blood seeped out of the skin surface, and without the slightest hesitation, he pressed his thumb down, leaving a bright red fingerprint on the snow-white silk paper.&nbsp;</span></p>

She slightly raised her head, revealing her slender and fair neck, and coldly said, “Luo Yi, there are two copies, you keep the other one.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An inexplicable light flashed across Luo Yi’s eyes as he put away the other piece of marriage withdrawal document away.</span></p>

It is a pity that our lives are different, I am a phoenix who wants to soar to the Ninth Heaven, and you once had the opportunity to reach the same height with me, it is a pity. Now that you have become a wild duck falling into the quagmire, there will never be a chance for you to fly. Luo Yi, you have no chance to make a comeback, it is better to give up, be a good ordinary person, and perhaps in the future there will be a normal girl that matches well with you who likes you. At that time you will feel that your decision today is right. Find a girl with the same circumstances as you and live happily together.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Lord Gu, my humble home is not suitable to entertain you three, please leave.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Rather than continue to look at their hypocritical faces, it was better to ask them to leave at this point.&nbsp;</span></p>
