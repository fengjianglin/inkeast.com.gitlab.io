 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know you have a lot of questions, but when it's all over, I will tell you everything about what happened in the [Seven Elements Relief Palace].” Nan Tieyi smiled calmly. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Tieyi, like the million-year-old soul, transformed into a stream of light, opened up the distance between them and began to swallow the violet energy between the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing in the starry sky, Ye Qingyu scanned the surroundings and saw that everyone was scrambling to draw on the essence and power of Quasi-emperor Mushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Except for one person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [White Jade Capital] successor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman in white, who was like a fairy of the ninth heaven, was dignified and graceful, emitting a faint pure moonlight glow all over. Her graceful indifference seemed somewhat unreal, like that of a fairy in a painting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She stood there quietly, maintaining a layer of perfectly round silver brilliance around her, blocking Quasi-emperor Mushan's violet emperor qi, and did not absorb this power as the others did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was taken aback when he saw this scene.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The [White Jade Capital] was rumoured to be an ancient supreme sect, mastered the secret of longevity, and that there had been a God emerged from this sect, who was said to be Immortal and inextinguishable. The laws and techniques they cultivate were different from those of ancient and modern martial arts. The action of the [White Jade Capital] successor suddenly made Ye Qingyu aware of something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Longevity!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Becoming Emperor!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The path of martial arts!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three statements like lightning flashed in Ye Qingyu's mind. He gradually arranged his thoughts and found some connection between the three.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The essence of a Quasi-emperor, which contains the Emperor qi, is the rarest elixir for martial artists. One breath could make a huge difference in one's cultivation. In particular, the slightest Emperor qi, once entered into a martial artist’s body, would be like a planted seed. As long as there is an opportunity, perhaps it can grow into a towering tree, and open the path of martial arts like a key...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu stood where he was, pondering over the gains and losses, and was not anxious to absorb that power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because the choice of the [White Jade Capital] successor made Ye Qingyu aware that, although the harvest was huge, it did not mean there would be no side effects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Drawing on the power of Quasi-emperor Mushan, he would be affected by his karma, and most importantly, inevitably be influenced by the power of Quasi-emperor Mushan, and perhaps embark on the same road. The end of this road may also be the cultivation base that Quasi-emperor Mushan possessed. There would be no road ahead, and only a steep cliff. At that time it would be even more difficult to advance further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's martial arts was originally incredibly complex, and now he was in the process of separating the wheat from the chaff. But by absorbing the power of Quasi-emperor Mushan, was that not the same as walking on an old road?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And if he wanted to embark on the path to the pinnacle, he must carve out his own way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu's mind gradually grew determined.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the face of such temptation, he finally restrained the heart of greed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heh heh, even if I don’t use it, there is no harm in storing some violet Emperor qi for use in the future!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu summoned out the [Blood Drinker Sword], activated the formations markings, and let it absorb the emperor qi between the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, he also activated the [Cloud Top Cauldron], which frantically swallowed the energy like a whale drawing up water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such efficiency was simply terrifyingly astonishing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The violet qi in the starry sky was frantically flowing in the direction of Ye Qingyu, forming a vortex of violet qi visible to the naked eye, resembling a violet dragon that was actively moving in the direction of Ye Qingyu, and gathering towards the [Blood Drinker Sword Pill] and the [Cloud Top Cauldron]. It was unknown how many more times efficient it was than that of other experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I...” The million-year-old soul was a bit astounded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Immortal body was a bottomless hole that could engulf all power, and had forcibly received two attacks from Quasi-emperor Mushan before, and thereby devoured all the power. Moreover, he had come prepared this time, and absorbed the violet qi through a secret method. Everything was within his calculation, except for Ye Qingyu. The method that Ye Qingyu used to swallowed the violet qi was so crazy that there was no way he could match up to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The boy was simply breaking the impossible and creating miracles everywhere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The million-year-old soul grudgingly flew further away, knowing that he could not compete with Ye Qingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed by. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, half an hour had past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the experts were frantically vying for the violet qi which remained after Quasi-emperor Mushan's death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, this violet Quasi-emperor qi was incomparably majestic; after all, it was the energy of a Quasi-emperor's Dharma body. The amount that was dispersing was so tremendous that it was simply indescribable, inexhaustible and endless. Therefore there was no need to fight for this power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, there was another change on the Quasi-emperor battlefield in the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were bursts of incomparably fierce deafening rumbles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The macaque Quasi-emperor had been seriously injured, his Dharma body almost broken apart, constantly reeling back in the starry sky. He roared repeatedly as the lightning cone and hammer in his hands frantically struck, releasing vast ocean-like Emperor qi. But under the impact of the old man Quasi-emperor, he failed to even stand firmly and could only roar, “If I was in my peak state would I be humiliated by you like this... ”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you’re a creature that had already rested in peace and had freed yourself from the earthly restraint, why don’t you rest quietly?” The old man Quasi-emperor’s words were the same as what [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] had said before. He had decided that the ancient macaque Quasi-emperor of thunder and lightning was a dead existence, and did not know for what reason he was reincarnated and came to the world to stir up trouble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anybody would be afraid of an existence like that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a creature that should not exist in the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other side, the Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor was already soaked with blood, one arm directly torn off by [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cough, cough... you... think you have won?” The Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor roared with laughter, coughing out blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From his laughter, there was sadness, reluctance, and anger. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, he was a Quasi-emperor. Although he had been living in seclusion for a long period of time, he had stepped into the Quasi-emperor realm for too long, though it can't be compared to [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]’s thousands of years of fame. When he had become a Quasi-emperor he had the ambition to sweep away all the forces but he was defeated so badly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was it really the end?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was soaked in blood all over, the blood light resembling blazing fire, and even his long hair was dyed red. Laughing, he swung his fist forward, “Whether it is a win or loss the later generations will evaluate. No matter who, no matter what choice, one must be prepared to bear the defeat. Your talent is indeed extraordinary, and you can be called the strongest human of your generation, unfortunately you went the wrong way, and became an Emperor with the help of that power. You’re just a puppet after all!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dao sound that filled the fist shattered the chest of the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But what about you? Cough, cough... you... how long can you live? Haha, such injuries, even a Fiendgod... cough, cough... would also die. I find it hard to believe that you can live in defiance of the natural order... cough!” The Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor coughed up blood, constantly drawing back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He laughed in an uncontrolled way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although his failure was imminent, the opponent had just miserably won, because Li Xiaofei was so severely wounded that his Dharma body was almost broken, and would most likely leave behind consequences. Even if he was victorious today, he had lost the future. Not only would it be difficult to become Emperor, his life yuan was reduced greatly, the Quasi-emperor source origin had been damaged and he would not live for long.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can an ordinary person understand the ambitions of a great person?” The blood all over [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] was blazing, producing a bright brilliance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor battle brought out a terrifying Dao sound and the power of destruction began to surge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Quasi-emperor’s other arm was also broken into pieces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His large body was retreating, blood shooting out, submerging several large stars.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the situation of the Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect was very bad. His Dharma body was almost collapsing, and he had already failed to maintain control of his energy. There was Emperor qi scattering across the starry Void of the universe, just like before the death of Quasi-emperor Mushan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very unwilling and had attempted to escape several times.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other side, following a deafening roar, the body of the ancient macaque-resembling, lightning-wielding Quasi-emperor was crushed, losing control of the lightning cone and hammer, which turned into two specks of green light floating in the starry Void, unable to release any ability as if the power had already been completely consumed... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another venerable Quasi-emperor was coming to an end. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn...” The million-year-old soul cursed out loud, looking at the distant old man Quasi-emperor. “That old man is really a Quasi-emperor assassin. He looks graceful but his actions are really ruthless.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this short period of time, the old man Quasi-emperor had already slaughtered two Quasi-emperors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remnant body of the Ancient macaque-resembling, lightning-wielding Quasi-emperor produced a deafening roar, before it transformed into a green-black torrent of energy, abandoning the old man Quasi-emperor and frantically sped toward [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei]... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Attack together, today, no matter what, we must kill Li Xiaofei, otherwise...” His voice resounded in the Void, as though he wanted to kill [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei] before death and did not seem to care about the old man who had forced him to this desperate state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Quasi-emperor of the Four Stars Sect also roared, light flames blazing all over his Dharma body, similarly transformed into a torrent of power, ignoring all attacks and sped towards [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha, you came at the right time, laugh all over the world, I have always acted on my own authority… [A smile overturns the sky]!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Xiaofei burst into loud laughter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[A smile overturns the sky]!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the most terrifying supreme martial arts of [Quasi-emperor Xiaofei].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This most terrifying legendary emperor technique had, after four thousand years, finally reappeared in the world. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His howl of laughter, like a tangible substance, was flowing in the Void, like some kind of strengthened wave frequency. His laughter unbelievably struck the surrounding stars, like an echo, instantly forming an earth-shattering force. It was as if the whole world was raging under this tremendous laugh, resonating, shaking... then breaking, collapsing and exploding. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Four Stars Sect Quasi-emperor and the Ancient macaque-resembling, lightning-wielding Quasi-emperor transformed into two currents that were enough to drown all the terrifying Dao sounds, collided with the laughter, and immediately entered into a strange state of annihilation. There was not the slightest fluctuation of energy, nor other brilliance or images, but that scene was unforgettable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu also stopped absorbing violet qi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stared blankly at the scene in the distance that went against the order of the laws of heaven and earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the real collision between Quasi-emperors, the real impact of the strongest forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The state of annihilation of the three forces, which were strangely different from each other, was clearly a manifestation of the primitive form of a very clear law. At this moment, the layer of white fabric that shrouded the mysteries of the Emperor’s Dao, the law, and the power between heaven and earth was torn apart by some sort of strength, and then nakedly displayed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thousand years in a blink, countless changes and transformations occurring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was unknown how many lightning were wildly flashing at the same time in Ye Qingyu's mind. Countless beams of light cut through the darkness and fog, lighting up many of the scenery he had never seen before, but there also seemed to be countless thunderstorms brewing... &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A great opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, those flashes of lightning and thunderbolts did not last long, died away after a flash, and the place that was illuminated went dark again, leaving only a faint impression in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clearly the profound meaning of the Emperor's Dao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the biggest secret between the heavens and earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingyu was impatient, subconsciously opened his eyes wide, wanting to see more. &nbsp;</span></p>

At this moment, the outcome of the Emperor battle had finally been determined——&nbsp;</span></p>
