 <p>Chapter 679, White clothes enter the palace &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space: pre">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>On the Cloud Ascension platform.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Crepe Myrtle Sect listen to my order. The 23rd generation disciple Li Rui, his martial arts is outstanding, he is talented, and he has a pure heart. I, the Palace Lord, appoint him to be the new Patriarch immediately.” The power of Ye Qingyu's consciousness power spread throughout Violet Spiritual Mountain, his indisputable voice of majesty and deterrence echoed through the mountain.</p>
 <p>The sky and earth fell silent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not only the people standing on the square, even the spiritual beasts and birds in the depths of the mountains all quietened down.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At that moment all living beings felt as though a deity had descended, and the crowd of ten thousand all sank to their knees. There was no creature in this world who dared to make the slightest movement, only trembling in awe and fear.</p>
 <p>Li Rui by the side, tightly clamped his lips.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The youngster seemed to be doing his best to control the quivering of his body out of fear</p>
 <p>The hesitation and worry in his eyes were almost about to turn into uncontrollable tears.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He could sense that innumerable eyes were focused on him. The owners of these eyes were the people that he usually needed to look up to and bow to, but at this time these eyes were filled with envy, shock, jealousy, and of all kinds of expressions. In his entire life he had never seen such a scene, had never stood in front of a crowd, and had never become the center of attention, let alone become the Patriarch of a sect.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All this, was given to him by the supreme War God beside him, the idol that he worshipped.</p>
 <p>Gasping excitedly, Li Rui could no longer contain his gratitude.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His eyes reddened slightly, and the corners of his eyes were a little moist. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu turned his head to look at Li Rui, a serious and solemn expression on his face as he whispered, “I have brought you to the Cloud Ascension platform, but whether the Crepe Myrtle Sect would obey and listen to you, rely on yourself. There are many affairs and urgent matters that you need to deal with. Your shoulders must be able to support this. Stand up straight, as long can do this, you can revitalize the Crepe Myrtle Sect and not besmirch the name Crepe Myrtle!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Then he turned his palm over and a jade scroll flashing with a white light appeared on his hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Here is a sword technique, called the [Four Moves of the Unmatched General]. It is the technique that I displayed at the [Breeze and Drizzle building] that day. It is very suitable for your cultivation, and your personality. I hope you can make good use of it. The next time we meet again, I look forward to you sitting and drinking with me with the confidence and authority of the Patriarch of a sect.”</p>
 <p>Here, Ye Qingyu patted youngster Li Rui's thin shoulder.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The next moment, his figure flashed slightly, turning into a wisp of water mist and disappearing where he was.</p>
 <p>Li Rui gazed into the sky at the faint rays of light streaking across, and then down at the thousands of eyes still fixed on him</p>
 <p>He closed his eyes slowly and drew a deep breath.</p>
 <p>He clenched the slightly warm jade scroll in his hand, hoping that it could bring him infinite courage and self-confidence. When he opened his eyes again, there was unexpectedly a strange light flickering within his eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was a new, confident, determined, and fearless glow.</p>
 <p>It seemed that he was finally enlightened. His timidity had faded into the vastness of heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>The thin and weak figure had gradually stood tall and upright.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the main square of Crepe Myrtle hall.</p>
 <p>The beautiful young woman Nan Hua, watching the youngster stepping up the Cloud Ascension platform from a distance, recalled the scene of being rescued by him in the [Breeze and Drizzle building].&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At that moment, she seemed to have a new understanding of what was valuable.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>In the sky. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu returned to the Light Palace.</p>
 <p>Today's visit to Crepe Myrtle Sect was not on the spur of the moment, but something he had long planned in advance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After leaving Youyan Pass, Ye Qingyu first came to the Snow Ground imperial court, and then conveniently passed Crepe Myrtle Sect, and then paid a visit to the Three Sects and Three Schools, the White Mountain Black Water Brute Race, the Desert Barbarian and the Southern Waters Demon Race. This was a real tour of the world.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He wanted to completely remove all the hidden dangers, whether it was a sect, foreign race or imperial court, all must surrender under the rule of Yu Xiaoxing. The world must be a unified domain to meet the rating from the Domain Alliance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Next stop, White Mountain Black Waters Brute Race Demon Court.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was standing at the door of the Light Palace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He suddenly thought of something, communicated with the little silver dragon, and the Light Palace cut through time and space, instantly passing across mountains and rivers.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A moment later.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Light Palace came to a stop above a lofty and pristine ice and snow forest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All kinds of ancient strange trees stood across the snow-capped mountain, like a boundless jade-coloured ocean.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>From afar, the snow-capped mountain and the sky melted into one color, as though a proud Snow Dragon was unhurriedly moving up and down the mountainous forest.</p>
 <p>Among the mountains, forest, and snow, a towering and imposing majestic palace, made of extremely rare black crystal stones, stood above the summit of the mountain, like the place of the Fiendgod. This was where the Brute King of the White Mountain Black Waters Brute Race resided, [Obsidian Palace].</p>
 <p>Around the palace, pale golden formation markings coated the walls.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The walls were tinged with black and gold alternating luster, dying the clouds and mist of the vast sky into an ink gold colour, like a constantly changing ink painting.</p>
 <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;Three resounding thuds of a drum suddenly sounded from the sacrificial platform in front of the [Obsidian Palace].&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seventeen burly brute warriors armed with beast bones were standing on the platform of bones that was shrouded in mist.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Behind them, on a mass of black clouds, there were seventeen giant drums of at least ten meters in diameter and sewn from animal skins.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Between the forest and snow, a number of golden &nbsp;formations, like silk dancing with the wind, suddenly darted toward the bottom layer of the mountain. The trajectory was clear and orderly.</p>
 <p>The Light Palace traveled across several snow-capped peaks before stopping in midair in front of the [Obsidian Palace].&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the same time.</p>
 <p>A silver trailing light streaked across the sky from the Light Palace.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu entered the palace of the Brute King.</p>
 <p>The white-clothed figure entered the palace alone to see the Brute King.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Upon hearing he drumbeats, the brute generals and clan leaders gathered in front of the [Obsidian Palace] stared at the tightly closed palace door with a look of great curiosity and shock. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“It’s the Light Palace of the Human Race.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“After many years, it reappeared again...”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why would the Human Race come here all of a sudden?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why should the great Brute King summon that human alone?”</p>
 <p>“Could the Human Race Palace Lord plan to challenge the Brute King?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ever since the white-clothed figure had gone in, the [Obsidian Palace], which restricted the full operation of formations, had been quiet and motionless, without the slightest strength or aura being emitted, showing a very bizarre silence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Half a day later.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The white-clothed figure came out.</p>
 <p>The [Obsidian Palace] door opened and the Brute Race citizens that had been waiting outside suddenly saw a flash of silver brilliance appear inside of the palace. And among the silver light, a human figure clad in a robe whiter than snow and with black hair flowing like a waterfall finally came out, silhouetted against the light.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Surprise.</p>
 <p>Astonishment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The crowd stared in disbelief at the man who was not like a human being but more like a god.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the young man clearly did not reveal any strength, but for some reason subconsciously there was a feeling of wanting to surrender to him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>For a moment, no one dared to speak.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In front of the palace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A tall and burly figure of more than seven meters tall, with fiery red hair, was clothed in a bear skin cloak. It was the commander of the Ancient Wild Battle corps, Jin Bi. He did not pay attention to the surprise and shock of the people, and instead personally led the way for the white-clothed human, driving the clouds Eastward and landing in front of the Witch God Shrine.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Brute Race was a race of royalty and religion, and in addition to the Brute King sitting in the palace, the high priest in the Witch God Shrine was one of the leaders of the Brute Race.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu entered the Witch God Shrine.</p>
 <p>The white-clothed figure entered the Witch God Shrine alone.</p>
 <p>The brute generals and clan leaders who hurried to the Witch God Shrine took on a look of shock one after another, while some of the clan leaders lashed out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It is an insult, how can a human being enter the Witch God Shrine!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Lord Witch God, hurry and make that filthy human body leave the shrine!”</p>
 <p>“There is a human who can enter the [Obsidian Palace] and the Witch God Shrine, who is he...”</p>
 <p>The Witch God Shrine, as a Shrine for the White Mountain Black Waters Brute Race to offer sacrifices to the gods and ancestors, was looked over by the high priests appointed by the gods. It was a shrine of thousands of years of history, the purest place between heaven and earth that the Brute Race believed in.</p>
 <p>Now the place had been polluted by the flesh and blood of other races. The crowd gathered outside the shrine was becoming more and more furious and restless.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The several clan leaders could no longer hold back their anger, and marched towards the temple.</p>
 <p>That was when----</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Rumble!!!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An extremely terrifying and bizarre gush of power rippled out of the Witch God Shrine, alarming everyone.</p>
 <p>The black witch flames around the Witch God Shrine raged, constantly changing into shapes of a variety of primitive ancient beasts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And from the shrine, there was another burst of wave-like yuan qi power that was enough to make the wind and clouds change colour.</p>
 <p>This violently surging, majestic and imposing yuan qi power, like a gust of raging wind, swept toward the Brute Race territory. Originally standing in a circle watching and clamouring, the crowd of brutes all looked aghast, shivering with a very shocked expression of panic.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, all the arguments abruptly stopped.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Across the entire Brute Race, there was only an invisible divine pressure that shrouded the whole snow mountain range, and the body and mind of each brute was filled with ultimate fear.</p>
 <p>Not only that, but all living creatures across the thousands of acres of snow mountain range and forest all felt the vast and spine-chilling power.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was a power enough to suffocate all the living creatures. All the spiritual beasts in the primeval forest came to a standstill, and even the mountain wind and rivers were abruptly frozen.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It seemed that everything was shaken by this terrifying power.</p>
 <p>It took half a day before it finally stopped.</p>
 <p>The gate of the Witch God Shrine opened. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>The white-clothed Ye Qingyu came out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As before, he was enveloped in a silver and white glow. His Immortal-like figure suddenly turned into a silver light screen, and without casting a glance at the dumbfounded crowd of Brute Race citizens, he turned and drifted away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And the Light Palace, which had been floating above the [Obsidian Palace], suddenly vanished.</p>
 <p>The ripples in the void faded.</p>
 <p>As though it had never appeared in the first place.</p>
 <p>Astonishment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Disbelief.</p>
 <p>Shock.</p>
 <p>Fear.</p>
 <p>All the brute generals and clan leaders were as though caught in a strange space and time, standing in the same place, motionless and in awe.</p>
 <p>Just as the entire Brute Race were blanked out. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Clang!</p>
 <p>Clang!</p>
 <p>The drum on the sacrificial altar sounded again.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This mountain-like tremor brought all the Brute Race citizens back from their trance, cleared their head, as they turned their heads in the direction of the altar with a puzzled and startled look.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the altar.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A silver dragon-shaped flame erupted from the black witch flames.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The bones of various strange beasts around the altar produced a very bizarre sound like the rubbing of teeth and bone.</p>
 <p>Suddenly from the [Obsidian Palace] and the Witch God Shrine, two black figures darted out at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With wide eyebrows, cheek marked with dark totems, slender and about five or six meters tall, and clad in a black and gold robe that flapped in the wind was the White Mountain Black Waters Brute King [Jin Bi]. The slender old man next to him, dressed in an ink-coloured robe, his grey hair hanging loose over his back, and holding an ancient beast head scepter was the Witch God high priest [Wu Que]. They stood imposingly, overlooking the Brute Race citizens beneath the platform.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I am enlightened by the White Mountain Black Waters Go. From today, the citizens of White Mountain Black Waters will serve the Snow Empire Empress Yu Xiaoxing. Those who disobey the decree of the God and provoke internal disorder will be immediately expelled from the Black Water mountain range, and accept the punishment of God,” the High priest roared, quaking the sky and earth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This statement shocked everyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How could it be...”</p>
 <p>“Bow down? To the Human Race?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why... how can the Brute Race citizens bow down like the cowardly and weak Human Race!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A sudden outburst of questioning and protest broke out from the crowd. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Quiet!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The voice of the Brute King was not loud, but the invisible deterrence was enough to silence all voices.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He looked at the nervous, and somewhat furious Brute Race citizens, and let out a gently sigh. Soon later his manner was more solemn and imposing, “I vow to the ancestors of the Brute Race, today we are not bowing down due to fear of the powers of the Human Race, nor are we enduring the humiliation in order to live, but rather to preserve the White Mountain Black Waters Brute Race, to strengthen my Brute Race.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The decree of the God, swearing by the ancestors,&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The White Mountain Black Waters Brute Race citizens extremely respected this sacred decree, which came from the mouth of their most revered King and the representative of the God.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All Brute Race citizens, at last, knelt down successively</p>
 <p>At that moment, they obeyed to the instinctive reaction of their spirit and will than to the guidance of the ancestors and God.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>No one questioned further, and no one argued, all citizens knelt down below the sacred altar, sincerely bowing their head.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In silence, an unprecedented change, like a hurricane that must not be disobeyed, struck the savage Brute Race.&nbsp;</p>
