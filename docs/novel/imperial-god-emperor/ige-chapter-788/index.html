The change was simply unthinkable. The experts that were able to come stand on Fierce Beast Peak were not ordinary people and were naturally able to see that the old man's previous state was not deliberately changed or faked, but his source origin was really depleted and he was in decaying state. However, now his blood and qi was abundant and full of vitality, and also a true endless source.&nbsp;</span></p>

Those words, that title, were too legendary and terrifying. Even if it were Yang Tianwu, a Saint expert, he also dared not speak of it.&nbsp;</span></p>

In particular, some Human Race experts were so excited that their eyes were brimming with tears.&nbsp;</span></p>

A sentence from the other side had already made the high and mighty Saint feel the true aura of death. &nbsp;</span></p>

Everyone could see the terrified and almost hideous face of [Iron Heart Blood Saint] Yang Tianwu dissipating in the dark sky like an illusion until there was nothing of him left.</span></p>

There was not the slightest whiff of blood or aura, nor even a ripple of power. It was simply difficult to associate the scene with the fall of a martial arts Saint expert.&nbsp;</span></p>

Unfortunately it just flashed for a moment, before the whole bottle rapidly dimmed down and lost its luster.&nbsp;</span></p>

His eyes fell on the bottle, gazing at it with a gentle look and finally he withdrew the palm.&nbsp;</span></p>

With a slight jolt, it suddenly erupted in silver a brilliance, soared into the Void, created layers of ripples, and eventually disappeared. &nbsp;</span></p>

Such a good treasure, you're just going to let go...” Fatty Sheng Yan, who had finally calmed down with great difficulty, felt a burst of pain. When he saw that his ancestor had caught the water bottle, he even thought to ask his ancestor to borrow the treasure to play with. Who would have thought that the old ancestor would let the water bottle go and return to the Jade Pearl Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was evidently very satisfied with this fellow descendant, but also cared about him a lot, “If you want, go snatch the [Heaven and Earth Plate] from the Jade Pearl Sect to play with later on.”&nbsp;</span></p>
