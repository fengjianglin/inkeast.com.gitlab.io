 <p>Chapter 316 - Bury The Dead</p>
 <p>“Is it that tentacle monster that appeared before?”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s chest was suddenly throbbing.</p>
 <p>A terrifying aura came from the shadows.</p>
 <p>After Ye Qingyu transformed into a dragon, he can be regarded as the emperor of the sea. He had no fears, but for some reason, when he saw the huge mysterious shadow, an involuntary shudder passed through him.</p>
 <p>“Should I dive down to see... Forget it, time is pressing. It’s more important to search for the [Formation Sovereign’s] legacy.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu dismissed all thoughts of diving down to investigate.</p>
 <p>With a slight jerk of his body, the silver sky dragon shot into the sky and broke out of the sea.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, he had arrived at the shoreline.</p>
 <p>The golden sandy shore that was washed by the blood red sea was not stained in the slightest, and the sand-like spheres of gold, glowing slightly, was swept into the sea. The coast was extremely wide and calm, and the sea was very shallow... There was no doubt that this is an almost flat and perfect beach.</p>
 <p>Further in the distance, there were huge mountain peaks and green trees, range upon range of mountains and dense forests.</p>
 <p>Song Xiaojun, Ximen Yeshui and Qin Zhishui were waiting on the shore.</p>
 <p>There were no signs of the armoured old man and they also did not know where he had gone.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu went passed the beach, landed in the middle of a forest and put on clothes before coming out of the forests to meet up again with the other three people.</p>
 <p>[True Will of the Sky Dragon] is indeed strong, but the only bad point is that once he transforms, the clothes on his body will be damaged and when he transforms back he will be naked. Luckily, Ye Qingyu had a lot of spare clothes with him, or else he would really have to run around naked.</p>
 <p>“Just now, thanks for your help Brother Ye.”</p>
 <p>Qin Zhishui expressed his thanks again.</p>
 <p>“Brother Qin is too polite...” Ye Qingyu smiled, then looked at Ximen Yeshui. “We have followed the route markings on the black jade scroll map, what do we do next? Is it the island the [Formation Sovereign’s] imperial palace?”</p>
 <p>Xiemen Yeshui gazed at the mountains and forests in the distance. “My family has said that at the end of the blood sea is the imperial palace. It should be right, it is very likely that the real [Formation Sovereign’s] imperial palace is here. Ahahaha, our chance is here... Where are you looking?”</p>
 <p>He stretched out his hand to point to the deepest part of the mountains and forest.</p>
 <p>In a distant place shrouded by masses of white clouds, vaguely there really was a palace floating in space.</p>
 <p>The palace and the shrine that emerged in the sky at the end of the fog zone were almost exactly identical, giving a majestic and sacred atmosphere.</p>
 <p>“Go!”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu no longer wasted time, leading the way, he leapt up and darted towards the depths of the forest.</p>
 <p>They were on the ground now, which was completely different from being on the surface of the sea. There were places where they could borrow force, and strong people like them, with one leap, can reach thousands of meters away.</p>
 <p>Rumble!</p>
 <p>The crowd, like giant rabbits, kept leaping and speeding forward.</p>
 <p>Only Song Xiaojun was on a dark demon lotus, floating in the sky, looking relaxed and at ease.</p>
 <p>In the twinkling of an eye, the crowd went into the forest.</p>
 <p>It looked like ordinary vegetation with no strange breath and smell, and there were no formations that they imagined it should have. Everything was normal, and between the vegetation, there were little birds and insects chirping, as well as snakes, worms, leopards and ants. Compared to the endless deathly red sea in the distance, this forest seemed like a paradise.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu was looking forward to finding some rare herbs and unusual plants in the forest.</p>
 <p>But he was disappointed.</p>
 <p>The vegetation seen in the forest were all very common species and nothing special.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a strange smell of blood wafted over from the front.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu and the other three people landed on a rock.</p>
 <p>Water was gurgling.</p>
 <p>The small stream was crystal clear, its colour was bright and beautiful, completely different to the water of the blood sea, flowing rapidly through the shade between the trees.</p>
 <p>On the river bank, it was a mess and vegetation was destroyed.</p>
 <p>There was a puddle of sparkling bloodstain, which had not completely dried and was emitting a faint delicate fragrance,. In the surroundings of the pool of blood were the remnants of dozens of worms and pythons, all ruptured like they had died an extremely miserable death.</p>
 <p>“It seems that some strong people have fought here and someone was injured.”</p>
 <p>“Hm, it should be the people that entered when the shrine gate opened three times before, they arrived early.”</p>
 <p>“The blood of the high-level experts had sprayed all over here, and the fragrance had attracted tigers, leopards and worms to come lick it, but the animals on the island are just ordinary creatures and can not withstand the power of the blood of the strong people. Even if they licked a drop of blood, they would instantly explode...”</p>
 <p>Qin Zhishui could not help sighing.</p>
 <p>“Yes, the pursuit of strength and longevity, and the pursuit of improvement in the quality of life are the instincts of every creature, but the ones that can achieve it, how many are there?” Ye Qingyu agreed with this conjecture.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>Ximen Yeshui urged.</p>
 <p>The people continued their journey.</p>
 <p>Along the way, they again encountered traces of combat.</p>
 <p>Because yuan qi had been suppressed here, simply relying on strength, the destructive power of the battle was limited and this forest was considered to be in a good condition. The smell of the corpses of the strong people that died in combat was enough to cause their hearts to shiver. The weakest one was at least of the Bitter Sea stage and when placed outside in the real world, he would still be a terrifying existence that can rule a region. Unfortunately, here, their life was as lowly as an ant; even when dead, there was not a person to bury their body.</p>
 <p>Every time Ye Qingyu saw such a scene, he could not help sigh.</p>
 <p>His personality was a little stubborn.</p>
 <p>Whether it’s because he’s a soft-hearted person or a stupid person, he stopped and patiently buried all the bodies.</p>
 <p>There was another scene of traces of combat.</p>
 <p>The closer they were to the central area, the more shocking the battle scenes were. There were more than five corpses on this battlefield.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu did not speak, and tidied and buried each of the bodies.</p>
 <p>“Brother, what are you doing with these dead people at this time?” Ximen Yeshui could not help complaining.</p>
 <p>Having been continuously delayed by him, Ximen Yeshui and Qin Zhishui were eventually unable to bear it and tried to persuade Ye Qingyu but he still would not listen. Seeing the [Base of the Formation Sovereign] in front and knowing that they came a bit late and other people have arrived before them, they could not hold back any longer. They bluntly advised Ye Qingyu a few words, before the two of them anxiously hurried ahead.</p>
 <p>Only Song Xiaojun was on the dark demon lotus, leisurely floating in the sky and accompanying Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>“Girl, you should go, don’t wait for me,” Ye Qingyu smiled, lifted his head and shouted.</p>
 <p>Song Xiaojun looked at him, but did not speak and did not leave.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu smiled and didn’t say anything else.</p>
 <p>“Woof, what exactly are you thinking?” Silly Dog Little Nine was turning crazy. “We should make use of the time to find the legacy of the [Formation Sovereign] and take possession of it. You’re so leisurely... you are making me impatient.”</p>
 <p>“The legacy will be obtained by a fateful person, it’s not important to be early or late,” Ye Qingyu said calmly.</p>
 <p>“But... you have to fight for your fate, if you don’t fight for it, how would it fall into your hands...” Silly dog said anxiously, “Master, at this time, you can’t be foolish. These dead people were probably not all good people, leave them.”</p>
 <p>“We are already late, the strong people that have entered before us were the real top-level existences, but even Mo Lingfeng, who was at the Ascending Heaven stage, had died. It can be seen how cruel and brutal this place is, so even if we hurry over, there is no way we would get a share.” Looking at the restless silly dog, Ye Qingyu said with a smile, “Since strength can’t obtain it, it depends on luck and character.”</p>
 <p>“Can... what does luck and character have to do with you burying the dead?” Silly dog Little Nine jumped up and down madly, wishing that he could drag Ye Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu gave a mysterious smile. “It’s not related. Saving a life is better than winning a seven-level pagoda. I buried a dead man that should be a one or two-level pagoda. Doing good deeds builds a good reputable character.”</p>
 <p>“I...” Leading the way, silly dog wailed to the heavens, “I am such a good dog, how did I meet such an unreliable master, it’s a sin.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu glanced at him, “if you can’t stand it, you can go first, we’ll meet there.”</p>
 <p>The silly dog very seriously thought for a moment, and although there was an anxious look of his face, he eventually answered in a disappointed tone, “Forget it, I’m staying here. If you encounter danger, I can still save you.”</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu smiled and did not say anything else.</p>
 <p>Digging a hole, lifting the corpse, filling the hole, erecting a sign…</p>
 <p>Several bodies were buried.</p>
 <p>He stood up and clapped his hands. “Well, we...”</p>
 <p>Before his voice died away.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu’s expression suddenly changed, looked to a distant thicket, his eyes taking on a guarded look, he slowly forced his way through. “Who are you? Why hide in the trees. Please show yourself.”</p>
 <p>No movement.</p>
 <p>The silly dog jumped on to Ye Qingyu’s body, his rosy nose was twitching and his expression was serious.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>He turned into a bolt of lightning and darted to the tree.</p>
 <p>“Careful.” Ye Qingyu immediately followed.</p>
 <p>“Master, come, it’s the old man, he’s dying...” Little Nine’s voice echoed.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu hurried over.</p>
 <p>Wading through a dense thicket, he saw the armoured old man that ran away before lying on the grass, his breathing was shallow and weak, and his face was pale and lifeless. He could not move and was breathing in more than breathing out. It was evident that he was almost dying. He could not speak any words and was holding the oar tight in his hand...</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu squatted down and carefully examined him.</p>
 <p>On the old man’s chest was a clear palm print on his armour and based on the extent of it dented in, it most likely had pressed into his chest. The attacker’s strength is frightening to be able to shatter the old man’s organs with just one palm attack. In the situation where yuan qi had been suppressed, the armoured old man would not survive.</p>
 <p>This nice man, the mediator, the crafty old fox, had come all the way here, but ultimately could not get pass this step.</p>
 <p>Ye Qingyu squatted down, single-handedly supporting him up, and after some thought, infused wisps of [Supreme Ice Flame] into the armoured old man’s heart meridians.</p>
